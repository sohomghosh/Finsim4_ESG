Executive summary
1.1 Across the globe, there is no difference in importance across the UN Sustainability Development Goals. Goals across social and environmental causes are equally 
important (77-78%).
1.2 Overall, 63% of consumers have made modest to significant shifts towards being more sustainable in the past five years (counting consumers that have also made 
minor changes, 85% have become 'greener' in their purchasing). However, this shift is not uniform across generations. 41% of Baby Boomers and 38% of Gen. X 
have not or have only made minor changes to their behavior whereas 32% of Millennials have significantly changed their behavior towards being more sustainable.
1.3 We see differences in how sustainability affects purchase decisions across generations. 33% of Millennials choose a sustainable alternative when available, whereas 
Attitudes  older generations are less likely to actively choose sustainable alternatives (24-29%).
towards  1.4 Consumers see themselves as the number one actor towards bringing positive environmental change (29%), closely followed by for-profit companies (22%) and 
international political actors (22%), all of which play key roles in advancing sustainability. To win with consumers, for-profit companies will need to act on growing

2.1 In a vacuum, sustainability is an important purchase criterion for: 1) Energy/utilities (74%); followed by 2) Construction/home (66%), Consumer goods (63%), Travel 
and tourism (62%), Automotive (61%); and 3) Financial services (44%).
2.2 50% of consumers rank sustainability asa top 5 value driver, which demonstrates its increasing relative importance during the purchase process and the role it plays
as a key differentiator in the overall value proposition. Furthermore, thoseconsumers that see themselves as drivers for change, rank the importance of sustainability 
even higher than those who do not.
Importance 
of  2.3 A lack of in-depth education causes consumers to use defaults or proxies when making sustainable decisions. For example, consumers usethe lifespan or durability 
of a product as a proxy for sustainability within consumer goods, automotive and construction/home. Similarly, they draw parallels to sustainability through raw

to pay more for sustainable products/services.

Shift in purchase behavior past 5 years (across countries)
Respondents indicating they have turned their way of living around to be sustainable form a small minority in all countries (1-10%). 
However, the degree of shift in purchasing behavior varies significantly by country.
Purchasing behavior has most significantly changed in Austria (42%), Italy (41%), Spain (35%) and Germany (34%). The least change indicated was in 
Japan (83%) followed by Denmark (48%), Australia and USA (46%) and Sweden (45%).

Consistently, the numbers of respondents saying they only buy sustainable products and services is small (0-6%). However, this 
increases substantially when factoring in those that buy sustainable alternatives whenever possible.
Many Italian (40%) respondents indicate they always choose a sustainable product or service when available. A high share of Japanese (68%) and Danish

Simon-Kucher& Partners | Global Sustainability Study 2021 l Consumers are key players for a sustainable future 22
Importance of sustainability | 2.3
Importance of defaults or proxies for sustainability
A lack of in-depth education causes consumers to use defaults or proxies when making sustainable decisions. 
For example, consumers use the lifespan or durability of a product as a proxy for sustainability within consumer goods, automotive and construction/home. 
Similarly, they draw parallels to sustainability through raw materials used and emissions generated for energy/utilities, and the offsetting of emissions for 
travel and tourism.
