III)  JOINT VENTURE:

VI.    BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:
FY2021 saw the Indian economy bouncing back from what has been the worst year on record. In terms of GDP growth, the Indian economy 
touched its lowest point when about a quarter of its GDP was wiped out in Q1FY21, in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19-induced 
lockdown. But the persistence in the economy triumphed and GDP growth turned positive in Q3 and Q4 of FY21, albeit by a mere 0.4% 
and 1.6% respectively. This growth number came as a sigh of relief and, perhaps, as a sign of thing to come in the year ahead. On a full 
financial year basis, real GDP is estimated at -7.3% year-on-year with all the levers of demand seeing contraction (barring government 
spending).

  While the pandemic continued to wreak havoc on the economy, the government announced a ` 30trn stimulus package (including 
RBI measures) between April and October, with an aim to boost consumption and demand. Grain distribution program, direct cash 
transfer, additional emergency working capital funding to farmers, additional pension payments and the government guarantee 
for credit were some of those initiatives announced. The stimulus package will be spread over the coming years, thus not adding 
to the government’s fiscal burden in FY21 alone.
   Inspite of that, India’s combined fiscal deficit ballooned to 13.9% of GDP in FY21, mainly due to reduced receipts amidst weak 
economic growth. By the end of the financial year, Government’s revenue numbers had started showing signs of improvement with 
the GST revenues for March 2021 being the highest ever monthly collection on record at ` 1.23trn. 
 
 
  On the bright side, in an otherwise underwhelming year, the rural economy continued to show strength through FY21. One of the 
main contributors to this was the labour displacement from urban to rural areas which happened as a direct consequence of the 
economic lockdown. At the same time, the urban economy suffered due to this displacement impacting overall economic growth. 
  The Indian equity markets remained volatile through the financial year. After hitting multi-year lows at the end of last financial year, 
markets eventually started to look more upbeat as economic activity slowly resumed and our grip on the health crisis strengthened. 
Much-needed relief and optimism were provided by the Q3FY21 corporate earnings which indicated a better-than-expected recovery 
in earnings as most businesses slowly got back on to their feet and witnessed sales growth on a sequential q-o-q basis. Equity markets 
touched record highs during Q4 of FY21 as vaccines were rolled out successfully in different parts of the world.
  Another factor that supported the market last year was the unabated foreign flows. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were the net 
buyers in the equities with inflows of USD 37.3bn. However, domestic institutional investors, both domestic insurance players and 
mutual funds, were net sellers in the equities market selling stocks worth USD 16.6 billion and USD 1.6 billion, respectively. 
10
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
 
 
 
  The rally seen in markets was broad-based with the benchmark indices S&P BSE Sensex rallying by 68% while the S&P BSE Midcap 
and S&P BSE Smallcap indices were up by a whopping 90.9% and 114.9%, respectively. As compared to other emerging markets, 
India outperformed with MSCI India delivering 69% in FY21 as compared to 55% returns for MSCI EM (in USD terms).
  The year ended on a rather sombre note with a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases seemingly the second wave of the pandemic in 
India. However, with the on-going vaccination drive and the unlikelihood of a nation-wide lockdown, this time around equities 
may have already priced in any risk on the Covid-19 front. What remains to be seen is the impact on businesses and the economy 
and the government’s response to the crisis. We expect the broad basing of the equity markets to continue in the coming year as 
well.
  Debt markets, much like their counterpart in the equities market, faced severe volatility through the year. The 10-yr G-Sec yields 
which were around 6.3% at the start of the pandemic touched a low of 5.75% in the initial part of the financial year and closed 
the year at 6.17%.
  To overcome the effects of the lockdown and the ensuing slowdown in the economy, RBI announced a host of measures to support 
businesses and economic growth. RBI’s monetary policy support came in the form of rate cuts, liquidity injection measures, and 
regulatory relaxations. RBI has lowered repo rate and reverse repo rate by 115 bps and 155 bps, respectively, since Mar-20 and 
ensured massive banking system liquidity surplus through increased OMO purchases (` 3.1 trillion in FY21 vs. ` 1.1 trillion in FY20).
 
Net Borrowing of Banks from the 
RBI adjusted for surplus cash 
reserve  
 
11
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
  Despite RBI’s accommodative stance and surplus liquidity in the system, higher than expected market borrowing, and hesitant central 
bank interventions kept the 10-yr G-Sec yields high in the second half of the financial year. 
  While the government borrowings have expanded manifold, given the large Fiscal deficits, corporate borrowing numbers have been 
much muted with the last financial year issuances by PSU/PFI borrowers being about ` 3.72 trillion growing at around 12% over the 
year. Along with large system liquidity and inflows in bond funds, the AAA short term spreads have tightened substantially. 
  As the market borrowings for FY 22 yet to pick up its pace, frictions with respect to auction cut offs may re-emerge in the absence of 
specific intervention measures by the RBI. How the RBI manages the challenging task of moderating excess liquidity and managing 
Forex and Bond market through interventions would set the tone for the market trends. Given the evolving landscape of normalising 
bond yields globally, expectations of recovering economic growth against India’s unique problem of sticky CPI trajectory, expectations 
need to be anchored around a directional uptick in yields over the coming year. Normalisation of liquidity would precede any change 
in monetary stance and a gradual reset of short-term rates closer to the repo rate over the next few quarters.
  The year was:
  The Indian Mutual Fund (MF) Industry witnessed a decent annual growth of 18.8%* in the Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under 
Management) during the year on the back of net inflows of assets.

INVESTOR EDUCATION
There has been, over the years, a marked shift in investor attitude towards planning and managing their finances. Also, the ongoing 
pandemic has made people reassess their financial goals and priorities, finding ways to simplify life and put more money aside for 
uncertainties and to be better prepared for the future. With a cut in spending due to lockdowns, people had a lot of opportunities for 
investments and all major asset classes like equity, debt, gold, or real estate generated investor interest at different points in time. In such 
times, our objective was to communicate the right narratives to savers and potential investors.  We reached out to B30 (Beyond Top 30) 
locations and created awareness on the basic tenets of saving and on how mutual funds can act as solutions for financial goals. Moving 
away from product-based selling to helping investors use mutual funds as solutions for their short term and long-term financial goals is 
the way ahead for the industry. By using different communication mediums, advertising, and leveraging thought-leadership platforms, 
we were able to effectively engage with both savers and investors across the country. 
Some of the major investor awareness activities undertaken by us during the year are mentioned as under:
1.  Content development
  a.  Articles – We continued our association with leading English and Hindi magazines, which have a large readership base, and  
published a series of investor education articles on different areas of personal finance, investing and mutual funds. How to 
build an emergency corpus, the need to continue SIPs and ensure that investors keep up the ‘’save and then spend’’ mode were 
some tactical topics for investor communication chosen during this period. We developed a lot of content to establish thought-
leadership on topics such as, ‘Fighting misinformation to preserve wealth during a crisis’, ‘Do not shy away from debt funds’, 
‘Right Investment Opportunity with Mutual Funds’, ‘Plan for your child’s aspirations with Mutual Funds’, ‘Planning well for 
retirement’ and ‘How International Diversification through Mutual Funds can help your portfolio’. In addition, we developed 
a book titled ‘How to pick debt funds that don’t fail you’ for those looking at debt funds in this volatile market scenario. The 
content, when required, was adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and circulated to investors and distribution 
partners alike and hosted on our website blog - Inspire.

  b.  Videos – As income increases across the board, millennials are not hesitant about spending on luxury and comfort items. In 
this spending spree they seldom think about retirement planning. To address this issue, we launched a series of videos to get 
retirement planning on top of their minds. We released a video on Mother’s Day to celebrate mothers as the first teacher, friend 
and  financial guide in our lives which helped us to build a very strong affinity for SBI Mutual Fund by establishing an emotional 
connect with audiences. 
2.  Social Media – Our objective on social media was to drive more engagement on our official social media handles by using an 
approach of unique content, rich formats, and engaging representations which helped widen our community on social media 
(Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter) to more than 8 lakh followers.  
3.  Digital Marketing – Like the previous year, we continued to focus on reaching out to millennials with investor education campaign 
on ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Scheme) and SIP. This was alongside our campaign #WhatsYourExcuse which was aimed at audiences 
who keep procrastinating their investments for various reasons. We launched the ‘Dream More, Achieve Much More’ campaign which 
focused on features such as power of compounding and benefits of starting early.  In addition, we continuously promoted concepts 
such as SIP, goal-based investing through mutual funds, and ELSS through prominent domains and finance-focused  websites. These 
activities were supplemented with organic and affiliate email campaigns which helped in reaching a wider online audience and 
created an awareness among them.
4.  Public Relations/Media – The pandemic and work-from-home situation fuelled a constant need for information from our investors 
on markets, asset classes, mutual funds, and our offerings. We stepped up our efforts in key media including regional (Newspapers, 
Magazines, Online and Television) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage through large format industry stories, 
authored articles, and Q&A’s with spokespersons. We continued to have a sustained focus on reaching out to potential investors 
through regional media, sharing concepts for investor awareness in various  regional language magazines.
5.  Television – We associated with leading business TV channels (Hindi & English) to reach out to a wider audience of savers and 
investors through relevant concepts on mutual fund awareness and financial literacy. A host of formats like panel discussions, in-
studio, and on-ground events to video conference discussions were used during the year. Some of the topics discussed were ‘How 
to arrange for liquidity and look for return keeping risk in mind’, ‘Financial Planning for Corona Warriors’, ‘Retirement Planning 
for MSMEs, Traders and Shop-owners’, ‘Managing Money during Covid-19’ and ‘Being financially prepared for your child’s dreams 
and needs’.
6.  Media Campaigns
  a.  During this financial year, we explored advertising on TV by associating with cricket in the sports genre.  It was an opportune 
time for us to promote mutual funds amongst the masses during a very high - profile bilateral series which was expected to 
garner higher viewership. Our investor education TVC (Television Commercial) was on staying invested through the ups and 
down of markets to achieve financial goals. These spots ran during the matches along with aston band advertisements. We also 
ran the campaign on digital mediums and on OTT platforms to reach the online audience. 
  b.  In line with our vision to position mutual funds as financial solutions for goals in life, we did multiple outdoor campaigns 
including a radio campaign on using solution-based mutual funds to plan for financial goals. The outdoor campaigns spread 
our messages across 60 locations (40 in B30 locations and 20 in T30 locations). The campaigns were titled ‘Being Retirement 
Ready with Mutual Funds’ and ‘Support your child’s dreams with Solution-oriented mutual funds’ and were run in 8 regional 
languages (Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, and Malayalam). The Radio Campaign which urged 
people to ‘Plan for your child’s dreams with mutual funds’ was played across FM stations with jingles in Hindi, Kannada, and 
Tamil. 
7.  We conducted 207 investor education meets with more than 8000 participants in FY 2021. In those events, trained professionals 
discussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealth creation habits, 
amongst other personal finance topics. Investor awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to 
explain, clarify and answer various queries. Our investor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India branches, Army 
cantonments, CRPF camps, Air Force stations, educational institutions, municipal schools, and at corporate offices of large, mid, and 
small sized companies. All such events continue to be well received by investors and non-investors alike and were a key to spreading 
financial literacy and awareness across the country. During the year, most of the investor education programs were virtual due to 
lockdowns in place due to the pandemic.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND NEW INITIATIVES 
1.  SBIMF was the first Mutual Fund to cross an AUM of ` 4 trillion and ` 5 trillion-mark in the industry. The quarterly AUM of SBIMF 
business increased to ` 5.04 trillion for the quarter ending March 2021 from ` 3.73 trillion for the quarter ending March 2020, an 
absolute year-on-year growth of 35.05%, during a period vastly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
2.  In FY 2021, SBIFMPL was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’, for the second time in a row, with improved scores across all defined 
parameters over last year. This certification is for the period between March 2021 and February 2022 and is a result of the High-Trust 
and High-Performance culture in the organisation. 
3.  FY 2021 was overshadowed by the Covid-19 pandemic, with strict lockdowns being imposed across various parts of the country. 
Amid those uncertain times, we were able to seamlessly on-board new customers and service existing ones, with our well-equipped 
digital infrastructure and extensive network of 222 locations’ presence across the country. We are well aligned in our endeavour 
to grow organically through higher penetration in B30 locations, with presence in 176 locations across these geographies.
4.  Majority of domestic investors are habituated to small and systematic savings. SIPs have played a crucial role in capitalising on this 
habit. The stickiness of these investments is another feature that has augured well for its growth, and also contributed in building 
long term relationships between the fund house, distributors, and investors. We have gained a fair share of the industry SIP book 
with our monthly SIP book at `1,382 crores in March 2021 as compared to ` 1,177 crores in March 2020, a growth of 17.41%. 
5.  Our fund house achieved tremendous growth in digital, both as a stand-alone channel and share of the overall business. The 
pandemic accelerated the investor preference towards our digital services, which already receive significant traction from our 
investors. About two thirds of the overall business came through digital channels and 77% of all the new investors added through 
PAN-based registration (8.88 lakhs) were added digitally. We introduced Aadhar and video KYC early on during the lockdown to 
facilitate onboarding of investors digitally. Also, online journeys for minor and HUF folio creation were introduced. In an industry-
first move, we introduced ‘WhatsApp for distributors’ with 18,000 IFAs onboarded.
6.  With a view to build a sustainable business for all stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously worked towards 
enhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same continued to be effective in FY 2021. 
7.  With the focus on customer service, SBIFM continues to invest significantly in this segment to help investors throughout their 
investment journey. We addressed many customer pain points by gathering customer feedback, through process improvements system 
enhancements,  strengthened governance around repeated queries as well as upskilling of teams along with speedy resolution. 
We made continuous improvement in on-boarding and investment processes by providing enhanced digital solutions both for our 
investors and distributors. Overall complaints continue to trend downwards.

8.  We substantially grew our PMS institutional book by on-boarding some of the most esteemed and largest PF (Provident Fund) 
organisations.  
9.  From customer’s perspective, SBI Mutual Fund continues to believe in offering investment solutions along with expanding our 
current basket with innovative products.  We launched our first international offering during the year, SBI International Access – 
US Equity FoF, that invests in US market. We also launched SBI Retirement Benefit Fund - with an added feature of ‘SIP Insure’, SBI 
Floating Rate Debt Fund and SBI Magnum Children’s Benefit Fund- Investment Plan during the year. We also expanded our passive

space, we integrated a leading digital infrastructure platform for our ETFs, which will act as a bridge between investors, brokers, 
and exchange.

investments into technology to protect our data and maintain highest standards of data security.

both application and data front. Also, we will work to develop and deepen our partnerships with entities across the mutual fund 
eco-system. This will help us consolidate our leadership position and get a higher wallet share.

caused by the pandemic.

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of  
SBI Funds Management Private Limited
Report on the audit of the standalone financial statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of SBI Funds Management Private Limited (“the Company”), 
which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2021, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including other Comprehensive Income), the 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the Standalone Financial 
Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
Standalone Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the  Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of 
affairs of the Company as at 31st March  2021, the profit and total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Director’s Report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. 
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view 
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
40
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•	 Identify	and	assess	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	Standalone	Financial	Statements,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error,	design	
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
•	 Obtain	an	understanding	of	internal	financial	control	relevant	to	the	audit	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	appropriate	
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls;
•	 Evaluate	the	appropriateness	of	accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	accounting	estimates	and	related	disclosures	
made by Management;
•	 Conclude	on	the	appropriateness	of	management’s	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	and,	based	on	the	audit	evidence	
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern;
•	 Evaluate	the	overall	presentation,	structure	and	content	of	the	Standalone	Financial	Statements,	including	the	disclosures,	and	
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation;
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in:
(i)  Planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and 
(ii)  To evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.
We communicate with the Management, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit;
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
ANNEXURE B TO INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
[Referred to in paragraph 2 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report 
to the Members of SBI Funds Management Private Limited of even date]
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i) 
of Sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“The Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial statements of SBI Funds Management Private 
Limited (“the Company”) as of 31st March 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial 
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent 
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to the standalone financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to the standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to the 
standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to the standalone 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to standalone financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that:
1.  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
the assets of the company;  
2.  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3.  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, 
an adequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, and such internal financial controls with 
reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at 31st March 2021, based on the internal financial controls 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Control Over Financial Reporting issued by ICAI.

entitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive 
payment is established.
b.   Interest income:
  Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit 
and loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.
1.7   Scheme Expenses

1.8   Leases
  The Company as a lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office on lease and other assets . 
The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of 
commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all 
lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 
value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
  Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU 
assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use 
assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
57
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. 
Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair 
value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. 
  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of 
use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability 
and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash 
flows. 
1.9  Foreign currencies
a.   Functional and presentation currency
  Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which 
the company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian 
rupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares 
and per share data.
b.  Foreign Currency Transactions and translations
  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.
i.  Monetary items:
  Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date 
exchange rates.
ii.  Non-monetary items: 
  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
  Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency 
at the exchange rate when fair value is determined. 
  The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose 
fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
1.10  Employee benefits 
a.   Defined Contribution Plan:
i.  Provident Fund 
  The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under 
the Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of 
employees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. 
  The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
ii.  Superannuation

Company contributes a sum equivalent to 15% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible managerial cadre 
58
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
employees’ salary to the Superannuation Fund administered by trustees and managed by the Life Insurance 
Corporation of India. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.
iii.  National Pension Scheme
  National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, 
the Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ 
salary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when 
incurred.
b.   Defined Benefit Plan: Gratuity 
  Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees 
and managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity 
benefits based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each 
financial year. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. 
  Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting 
date using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit 
plan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government 
securities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise.
c.   Other Long-term employee benefit obligation: Compensated absences
  The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are 
entitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the 
number of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation 
carried out as at the end of each financial year. 
d.   Employee Share Based Payments:
  Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair 
value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
  The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of 
the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding 
adjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
1.11   Income taxes
  Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. 
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
a.  Current tax
  Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the 
reporting date.
  Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in 
Other Comprehensive income or in Equity.
59
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax 
paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to 
settle the asset and liability on a net basis. 
b.  Deferred tax
  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered. 
  Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries 
and associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that 
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
1.12  Property, plant and equipment
a.   Recognition and measurement
  All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.
  Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready 
for use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.
  Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five 
years.
b.  Depreciation
  Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less 
residual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under schedule II of Company Act, 2013. Estimated useful lives of 
property, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Company Act, 2013 and adopted by management 
for various block of assets in as under:
Assets Useful life (in years)
Office Premises 60
Computers- Servers and networks 6
Computers- End user devices, such as, desktops, laptops, etc. 3
Furniture and fixtures 10
Office Equipment (including Electrical Installation & Building Management systems) 5
Glow Sign Board 2
Vehicles 8
  Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata 
basis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.
  All fixed assets individually costing less than ` 5,000 are fully depreciated in the year of purchase/acquisition.
  Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are 
accounted prospectively.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.13  Intangible assets
a.   Recognition and measurement
  Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization 
and accumulated impairment loss, if any.
  Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost 
are expensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. 
  Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective 
basis. 
b.   Useful lives of intangible assets
  Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:
Description of assets Useful lives  Method of depreciation / 
 (In years) amortization 
Computer software 3 - 6 years SLM
Website development cost 3 years  SLM
Copyright licenses  5 years SLM
1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets
  Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
asset is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued 
use of the asset.
  Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying 
amount and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset 
  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and 
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
  The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
  Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
present obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase 
in provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. 
  When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third 
party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount 
of the receivable can be measured reliably.
  Contingent liabilities
  A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
61
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised 
because it cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but 
discloses its existence in the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered 
remote.
  Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.
  Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that 
a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1.16  Financial instruments 
  Financial instruments
  Initial recognition
  The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade 
receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. 
  Subsequent measurement
  Financial assets carried at amortised cost
  A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to 
hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
  Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
  A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a 
business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
  The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present 
the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where 
the Company has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as 
equity instruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.
  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
  A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or 
loss.
  Derecognition of Financial assets
  The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when 
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party
  Impairment of financial assets
  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of 
financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). 
  Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
•	 The	12-months	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	those	default	events	on	the	financial	
instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or 
62
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•	 Full	lifetime	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	all	possible	default	events	over	the	life	
of the financial instrument) 
  For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on 
the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in 
the forward-looking estimates are analysed. 
  For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase 
in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.
  Financial liabilities
  Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year 
from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
  Derecognition of financial liabilities
  The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have 
expired. 
  Equity instruments:
  All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading 
are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI 
or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial 
recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value 
changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from 
OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative 
gain or loss within equity.
  Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
1.17   Earnings per share
  The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding during the year.
  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity 
shares were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.
1.18   Dividends
  Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends 
are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.
1.19   Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, call deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of change in value.
1.20   Standards Issued but not Effective
  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) nofifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no such 
notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from April 1, 2021.

Defined benefit plan - Gratuity       
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India (funded). The Company’s defined benefit gratuity plan is a final salary plan 
for employees. which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. The fund has the form of a trust and it is 
governed by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition 
of the Investment strategy .              
Risks associated with defined benefit plan       
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:       
Interest Rate Risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring 
higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of 
asset.       
Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such 
an, increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.       
Investment Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will 
create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other 
debt instruments.       
Asset Liability Matching Risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of 
Income Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.       
Mortality Risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any 
longevity risk.       
Concentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk. All the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out 
all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.     
Gratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by rule 103 of Income tax rules 1962.     
The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.       
Particulars Valuation as at

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end 
of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative 
of the actual change in the projected benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one 
another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the projected benefit obligation has been calculated using 
the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same method as applied in calculating the projected 
benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the 
sensitivity analysis from prior years.
29. The Code on Social Security,2020 (‘Code’) relating to employee benefits during employment and post employment benefits received 
Presidential assent in September 2020. The Code has been published in the Gazette of India. However, the date on which the Code will 
come into effect has not been notified. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into effect and will record any 
related impact in the period the Code becomes effective

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial instruments are categorized into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurement as described 
below:             
Level 1 : On the basis of latest NAV/Market price available.              
Level 2 : Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly.             
Level 3 : The investment has been made in December 2019 as part of warehousing policy. The Company has been regular in servicing its 
dues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. Based on latest valuation report it is carried at fair value 
(PY  valued at its cost as at reporting date.)             
 
Capital management :             
The Company’s capital management strategy is to effectively determine, raise and deploy capital so as to create value for its shareholders. 
The same is done through equity.             
Financial Risk Management Framework :             
The different types of risks the company is exposed to are liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.     
1. Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient 
bank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.
2. Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial 
loss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/
moderate etc.
3. Foreign currency risk management:    
The company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.   
The carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the 
reporting period are as follows.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis:     
The following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding 
foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency 
rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. 
For a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the 
balances below would be negative.

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the 
end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure 
in Foreign currency is immaterial.

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of  
SBI Funds Management Private Limited
Report on the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of SBI Funds Management Private Limited (“the Holding Company”), 
its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) and its associate company which comprise 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2021, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that 
date and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the  Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the 
Group as at 31st March 2021, the consolidated profit and consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and 
its consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Director’s Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial 
performance, consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Company 
in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group,  and its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give 
94
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , which have been used for the purpose of 
preparation of these Consolidated  Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those respective Board of Directors included in the group are also responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
l  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; 
l  Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding 
Company, its subsidiary companies and its associate companies which are incorporated in India has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements, in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;
l  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management;
l  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;
l  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation;
l  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group 
to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and 
(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.
We communicate with the Management, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Private Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its associate company, which are companies incorporated in India, as of 31st March 2021 in

The Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its associate company, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by 
the Holding Company and its Associate company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of 
its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. 
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s and its Associate Company’s, incorporated in India, internal financial 
controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements, based on our audit. We Conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI  and the Standards 
on Auditing prescribed under section 143 (10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to the consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
the consolidated financial statements, was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to the consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to the 
consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness 
of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred 
to in the other matter paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding Company’s 
and its associate company’s internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company.

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that:

the assets of the company;

c.  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not to 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements

1.4   Measurement of fair value
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date. 
  In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the 
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
•  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access 
at the measurement date;
•  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly; and
•  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1.5   Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS 
requires the management of the Company to make estimates, judgements and assumptions. These estimates, judgements and 
assumptions affect application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses for the periods 
presented.
  In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting 
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are as below:
•  Financial instruments
•  Property, plant and equipment

entitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive 
payment is established.
b.   Interest income:
  Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit 
and loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.
1.7   Scheme Expenses 
a.   Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) 
Regulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.

1.8   Leases
  The Company as a lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office on lease and other assets . 
The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if 
the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) 
the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of 
commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all 
lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 
value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
110
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU 
assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use 
assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 
made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from 
the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. 
Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair 
value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. 
  The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of 
use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability 
and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash 
flows. 
1.9   Foreign currencies
a.   Functional and presentation currency
  Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which 
the company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian 
rupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares 
and per share data.
b.   Foreign Currency Transactions and translations
  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.
i.  Monetary items:
  Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date 
exchange rates.
ii.   Non-monetary items: 
  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. 
  Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency 
at the exchange rate when fair value is determined. 
  The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose 
fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).
1.10  Employee benefits 
a.   Defined Contribution Plan:
i.  Provident Fund 
  The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under 
the Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of 
employees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. 
111
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
ii.  Superannuation 
  Superannuation fund is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for superannuation fund, the Company 
contributes a sum equivalent to 15% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible managerial cadre employees’ 
salary to the Superannuation Fund administered by trustees and managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of 
India. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.
iii.  National Pension Scheme
  National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, 
the Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ 
salary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when 
incurred.
b.   Defined Benefit Plan: Gratuity 
  Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees and 
managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity benefits 
based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each financial year. 
Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. 
  Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting date 
using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its 
balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government securities yield. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded in 
other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
c.   Other Long-term employee benefit obligation: Compensated absences
  The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are entitled 
to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the number of 
days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation carried out as 
at the end of each financial year. 
d.   Employee Share Based Payments:
  Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value 
of the equity instruments at the grant date.
  The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in 
profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
1.11  Income taxes
  Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. 
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items 
that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
a.  Current tax
  Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
112
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the 
reporting date.
  Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside 
profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in 
Other Comprehensive income or in Equity.
  Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax 
paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to 
settle the asset and liability on a net basis. 
b.  Deferred tax
  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset 
to be recovered. 
  Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries 
and associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that 
the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
  The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
1.12  Property, plant and equipment
a.   Recognition and measurement
  All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.
  Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready 
for use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.
  Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five 
years.
b.  Depreciation
  Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less 
residual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under schedule II of Company Act, 2013. Estimated useful lives of 
property, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Company Act, 2013 and adopted by management 
for various block of assets is as under:

SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata 
basis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.
  Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are 
accounted prospectively. 
1.13  Intangible assets
a.   Recognition and measurement
  Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and 
accumulated impairment loss, if any.
  Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost are 
expensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. 
  Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the 
end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. 
b.   Useful lives of intangible assets
  Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:
Description of assets Useful lives  (In years) Method of amortization 
Computer software 3 - 6 years SLM
Website development cost 3 years  SLM
Copyright licenses  5 years SLM
1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets 
  Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset 
is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the 
asset.
  Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying amount 
and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. 
1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset 
  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
  The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
  Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase in provision due to 
passage of time is recognised as finance cost. 
  When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable 
can be measured reliably.
  Contingent liabilities
  A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence 
114
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is 
not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured 
with sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial 
statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.
  Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.
  Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that a 
liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1.16  Financial instruments 
  Initial recognition
  The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables 
which are initially measured at transaction price. 
  Subsequent measurement
  Financial assets carried at amortised cost
  A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold 
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
  Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
  A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
  The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the 
subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where the 
Company has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as equity 
instruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.
  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
  A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
  Derecognition of Financial assets
  The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party
  Impairment of financial assets
  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial 
assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). 
  Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
•  The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or 
115
SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
•  Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of 
the financial instrument) 
  For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from 
initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed. 
  For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in 
credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.
  Financial liabilities
  Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from 
the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
  Derecognition of financial liabilities
  The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. 
  Equity instruments:
  All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are 
classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. 
The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition 
and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the 
instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of 
Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
  Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
1.17  Earnings per share
  The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year.
  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares 
were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.
1.18  Dividends
  Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are 
recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.
1.19  Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, call deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of change in value.
1.20  Standards Issued but not Effective
  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) nofifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards. There is no such 
notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from April 1, 2020

Defined benefit plan - Gratuity       
The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan in India (funded) The Company’s defined benefit gratuity plan is a final salary plan 
for employees. which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. The fund has the form of a trust and it is 
governed by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition 
of the Investment strategy.       
Risks associated with defined benefit plan       
Gratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:       
Interest Rate Risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring 
higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of 
asset.       
Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an 
increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.       
Investment Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will 
create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other 
debt instruments.       
Asset Liability Matching Risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of 
Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.       
Mortality Risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any 
longevity risk.       
Concentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk. All the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out 
all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   
Gratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by rule 103 of Income tax rules 1962.   
The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.

The sensitivity analysis have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end 
of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative 
of the actual change in the projected benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one 
another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of 
the projected benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is 
the same method as applied in calculating the projected benefit obligation as recognised in the balance sheet. There was no change in 
the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior years.

Level 1 : On the basis of latest NAV/Market price available.              
Level 2 : Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly.             
Level 3 : The investment has been made in December 2019 as part of warehousing policy. The Company has been regular in servicing its 
dues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. Based on latest valuation report it is carried at fair value 
(PY  valued at its cost as at reporting date.)             
Capital management :             
The Company’s capital management strategy is to effectively determine, raise and deploy capital so as to create value for its shareholders. 
The same is done through equity.             
Financial Risk Management Framework :             
The different types of risks the company is exposed to are liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.     
1. Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient 
bank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.     
2. Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial 
loss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/
moderate etc.             
3. Foreign currency risk management:    
The company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.   
The carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the 
reporting period are as follows.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis:       
The following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding 
foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency 
rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. 
For a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the 
balances below would be negative

In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the 
end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure 
in Foreign currency is immaterial.
