2020 Environmental, Social & Governance  
Performance Data Summary
Measuring Progress Against Our Environmental, 
Social, and Governance Goals 
The Bank of America Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) approach is integrated into each of our eight lines of business 
and helps define how we pursue business opportunities and manage risk. In 2020, the importance of a comprehensive and effective 
ESG approach was underscored by the health and humanitarian crisis, and groundswells of support in the fight against racial 
inequality and the growing reality of climate change. To this end, we announced a $1 billion* commitment to advance racial equality 
and economic opportunity; and committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In the following pages, we 
report progress on goals to make our operations more sustainable, support our employees and invest in communities – increasing 
prosperity and resiliency.  
In 2020, Brian Moynihan, Bank of America Chairman and CEO, in his role as Chair of the International Business Council (IBC) of  
the World Economic Forum and in collaboration with the Big Four accounting firms, led the development of the stakeholder 
capitalism metrics. The metrics include ESG indicators and disclosures for financial markets, investors and society. Structured 
around the pillars of principles of governance, planet, people and prosperity, the identified metrics and disclosures enable companies 
to collectively report on non-financial disclosures. Click here and refer to pages 40-44 to access our IBC metrics, which have been 
assured by a third party. This Performance Data Summary and our latest Annual Report are organized with respect to these metrics.

or their programming had been digitized, postponed or canceled, providing more than $50 million in support to arts and culture nonprofits around the world. The number of 
institutions supported dropped largely due to a decline in employee directed giving and related matching gifts. We provided general operating relief and postponed the Art 
Conservation Program to 2021 in order to convert those funds to that purpose.

Sustainable Finance 
Launched in 2020, Bank of America’s Global Sustainable Finance Group works across our eight lines of business to mobilize and scale 
capital deployment that is aligned with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The two main pillars of 
this business focus are Environmental Transition and Inclusive Development. Reporting below shows how capital is being mobilized by 
business segmentation. Projects under Environmental Transition could include renewable energy, green transportation, and sustainable 
food, agriculture, forestry or water – to name a few. Under Inclusive Development, applicable projects include education, affordable 
housing, health, and economic inclusion. For historical data prior to 2020, please refer to ESG Performance Data Summary reports 
found on bankofamerica.com/environment. 
Sustainable Finance Themes - the “E” vs. “S” (in “ESG”) 
Environmental Transition “E” 
Address climate change and promote 
circular economy 
Inclusive Development “S” 
Advance community development, affordable

Corporation Environmental and Social  
As of year-end 2020, approximately 58,000 employees and contractors across the  
Risk Policy Framework (ESRPF) 
enter prise were trained on this framework. We provide an accommodation version for 
those with unique learning needs and a convenient mobile version to ensure accessibility  
for all learners.  
Examples of transactions requiring additional review: 
1. Bank of America was invited to participate in a corporate finance for an energy 
transport company where use of proceeds would be focused on expansion of a fossil 
fuel export facility from a developing country.  Bank of America determined that we 
were unable to consider the opportunity within the scope of our ESG transaction review 
process and declined moving forward on the transaction.   
2. Bank of America was asked by a company in the mining sector to assist in accessing 
capital markets to raise money for company activities. Company operations are in a 
developing country and in locations with unique biodiversity issues, a water stressed 
environment, among other concerns. Bank of America retained an independent consultant 
Examples of transactions   to review earlier environmental impact assessments of company mine locations and  2020
requiring additional review 
the company progress towards addressing risk mitigation plans from that work. The 
independent review and client engagement showed that the mining firm was able to 
follow through on historical commitments and demonstrate a good track record on ESG 
risk management. Bank of America pursued the client opportunity. 
3. Bank of America was invited to participate in providing strategic financial advisory 
services to an international global marine shipping firm located in an overseas market. 
As a part of client due diligence, we evaluated the firm’s commitment towards climate 
change attributed to the operation of the firm’s ocean going vessels and end of life 
recycling of these same ships. Bank of America was able to determine these risks were 
being managed appropriately and to ensure that adequate disclosures on related risks 
were being made to future investors in this firm.

Impact of greenhouse gas emissions Dollars — — — $204,123,000
  * Impacted by the health and humanitarian crisis. 
**  Calculated commuting emissions also include employee use of laptops and monitors at home due to the virtual posture in 2020. 
We follow the WRI and WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. We use an operational control approach to define our 
boundary. The base year for emissions reductions is 2010; the rationale for choosing 2010 as the base year is that 2010 is the earliest year with complete, high quality data. Emissions are recalculated 
back to the base year when a change to a prior inventory would result in a change in emissions of 0.5% or greater. Scope 1 and 2 calculations are based on site-specific data for fuel consumed and utilities 
purchased, applying published emissions factors and global warming potentials (GWPs). Scope 3 calculations are based on data for the relevant activity, applying published emissions factors and GWPs. 
Where actual data is not available, estimates are made based on actual data collected in prior years. The gases included in the calculation of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are CO, CH , N O, HFCs and 
2  4  2 
PFCs. Our market-based greenhouse gas emissions include the impact of renewable energy certificates (RECs) purchased in the U.S., Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) purchased in the 
U.K., Guarantees of Origin (GOs) purchased in Spain and Ireland, J-Credits purchased for Japan, PowerPlus purchased for India, and International RECs (I-RECs). All U.S. RECs purchased by Bank of America 
are Green-e certified. Emissions reflect supplier-specific emission rates where available, all of which comply with Scope 2 Guidance criteria. Emissions reflect residual mix factors for European facilities. 
Residual mix factors are not currently available for facilities outside of Europe. Location-based emission factors are used to quantify electricity-related Scope 3 emissions. 
2020 offsets are sourced from four projects: GreenTrees Reforestation Project, Cordillera Azul REDD+ Project, TIST Small Group Tree Planting: Kenya, Uganda, and the Katingan Peatland Restoration 
and Conservation Project. Offset retirements are subtracted from gross Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, resulting in total net Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions of zero. 
Offsets are also applied to Scope 3 Business Travel emissions, resulting in net Business Travel emissions of zero. 
The impact of greenhouse gas emissions is calculated using the social cost factor for CO as reported using the EPA’s 2020 social cost of carbon of $51/metric ton CO (3% discount rate, reported in 
2  2 
2020 USD).

Data for water withdrawals are sourced from utility bills where possible. Where utility bills are not available (such as in a leased property), we estimate based on internal 
estimation intensities by building type. These estimation intensities are calculated annually based on actual data. We use the same boundary in calculating water withdrawals 
as in our greenhouse gas emissions calculations. Water is withdrawn from municipal sources (except for a small amount of rainwater) and discharged to municipal sewer 
systems. Water consumption is equal to water used for irrigation. Data for water reused or recycled are sourced from meter readings for the systems in place.
