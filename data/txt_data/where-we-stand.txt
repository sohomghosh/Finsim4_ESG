A secure retirement 
for port workers
Forth Ports owns and manages the largest ports on the 
Thames, in London, and in Scotland. And its London 
facility at Tilbury is also the UK’s greenest port. The 
company, founded 50 years ago, employs more than 1,100 
people –engineers, electricians, cargo managers, safety 
supervisors, technicians and others who collectively 
handle some 41 million tonnes of cargo every year. 
This relatively small workforce has an outsized impact on 
the British economy. Forth Ports’ employees literally move 
the food, medicines, grain, automobiles, timber, fuel and 
machinery that make the country’s businesses and 
consumers tick. Their output adds £950 million of 
economic value and helps improve the quality of life for 
millions of people.
Their financial well-being, across their lifetimes, depends 
in part on the retirement security provided by their 
employer’s pension plan. BlackRock has worked closely 
with Forth Ports to manage a large part of its pension plan 
that helps employees save for retirement by investing in 
stocks, bonds, real estate and infrastructure such as 
bridges, renewable power –and even ports. In that way, 
these investments can help support Forth Ports’ 
employees in retirement by giving them access to 
opportunities in the local and global economies they 
helped to build.

UPS delivers a savings 
program for workers 
Before people can begin to save for retirement, they need to 
meet basic and unexpected needs. Yet a 2018 report1shows 
that 40% of U.S. adults don’t have enough savings to even 
cover a $400* emergency expense. 
To tackle this issue, we created BlackRock’s Emergency 
Savings Initiativein the U.S. The goal: to help low-and 
moderate-income workers around the world access 
strategies and tools to make it easier to set aside savings. 
Our program recruits partners from the fintech, nonprofit
and academic worlds to work with companies across sectors, 
to test new solutions and implement proven ones.
UPS was an early participant. To address their workers’ 
financial well-being, the global shipping and logistics firm 
partnered with Commonwealth, a nonprofit, and Voya 
Financial, their retirement plan administrator, to help
90,000 of their U.S.-based non-union employees save for 
emergencies within their current retirement accounts. 
Eligible employees can elect to divert up to 5% of their 
paycheckto the emergency account, and can invest the 
money in the same options offered in their 401(k).  
COVID-19 has only deepened the urgency of the savings 
crisis. Building an immediate financial safety net has a long-
term impact by protecting against sudden hardship, making 
it possible to invest for the future.

Championing 
investors in Brazil
iShares ETFs play an important role in bringing market 
access to people and countries that have traditionally put 
less emphasis on individual investing. That’s particularly 
true in many emerging markets, where a growing middle 
class seeks to save for retirement and other goals for the 
first time.  
In Brazil, for example, investing in foreign stocks was 
largely limited to professionals. Individuals, if they 
invested at all, tended to stick with domestic bonds, which 
provided an attractive return but only when interest rates 
were high. 
BlackRock’s iShares introduced Brazil’s first local ETF in 
2008, enabling Brazilians to access a diversified1bundle 
of local stocks in a single fund, at low cost. Over time, we 
have added access to markets beyond Brazil, and as 
investing has gained in popularity, so have ETFs. 
In a further advance, regulators in Brazil recently 
permitted international ETFs to be listed on the Brazilian 
exchange, in local currency. This has opened the door to 
world markets, putting more investors in control of their 
financial futures.

Expanding choice
in Mexico
There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to investing. 
Every person’s financial journey is unique, shaped by a 
nearly infinite combination of circumstances. That’s why 
we’re committed to offering our clients the widest set of 
choices to help meet their needs.
In Mexico, for example, which has a burgeoning 
population of over 125 million people, we’re meeting
the need for world-class asset and risk management 
expertise. In 2018, BlackRock acquired the asset 
management arm of Citibanamexto provide retail 
investors with a broad array of our actively managed 
mutual funds. For the equivalent of $50, any local investor 
could start building a diversified portfolio. And to help 
people make informed choices, we partnered with 
Citibanamexto build educational content for bankers
and end clients. 
As community members, we’re committed to broadening 
financial inclusion in other ways too. Last July, we 
launched Mexico’s first sustainable multi-asset income 
fund, in response to growing interest in ESG. At the same 
time, to help ease some of the hardships caused by 
COVID, we donated more than 40% of the first six 
months’ administration fees of this fund to organizations 
focused on increasing employment opportunities and 
economic resilience.

Helping a UK charity 
fulfill its mission
Part of BlackRock's purpose is helping our clients achieve 
their purpose. In the case of the hundreds of organizations 
we serve, that means investing and managing the portfolios 
that help them pursue their objectives. 
One example: St John Ambulance responds to health 
emergencies, supports local UK communities, and saves 
lives. As a volunteer-led health and first aid charity, they 
have relieved people from injury, illness, distress and 
suffering for over 140 years. They treat and transport 
thousands of patients each year, and in times of crisis are 
England’s national health reserve.
On April 1, 2020, St John Ambulance changed its entire 
delivery to support the national COVID-19 emergency 
response and fight the virus. They recruited and trained 
new volunteers and upskilled current volunteers to 
perform duties for England’s health and emergency 
ambulance services and other pressure-relieving 
activities. And from this past March to September, St John 
Ambulance volunteers gave over 200,000 hours of skilled 
volunteer support to patients.
BlackRock has been managing St John Ambulance’s 
entire investment portfolio for over 15 years. Our support 
for their investment strategy makes it easier for St John 
Ambulance to maximize their focus and resources on 
fulfilling their philanthropic mission.

Generating energy
and jobs in Norway 
Pension funds and other institutions are increasingly 
investing in renewable energy because they care about 
climate change and seek alternative sources of return
in their portfolios. BlackRock helps these clients invest 
directly in wind and solar infrastructure projects around the 
world that support the transition to a net zero economy. 
Our current portfolio of over 270 solar and wind projects 
has globally generated the equivalent energy of powering 
30 million homes and removing 36 million cars off the 
road; they have also provided approximately 20,000 jobs.1
One of these is GulesletteneWind Farm, on the west coast 
of Norway, in which BlackRock took a 100% equity 
ownership stake in 2018. The wind farm will run on 47 
turbines and expects to provide one million homes with 
green energy and save 25 million cubic meters of water 
over the project lifetime. 
The project will also continue to bring large-scale benefits 
to the community, including 500 construction and 
operational management jobs; it has also pledged 
€730,000*to build cross-country ski tracks for the local 
community, further contributing to the local economy.

A pension insurer
goes all-in on ESG 
As society has demanded more sustainable practices 
from governments and companies, sustainable investing 
has transitioned from a niche strategy to playing a 
central role in portfolios. BlackRock works closely with 
clients to identify whether they have the right products 
for their needs. 
Ilmarinen is Finland’s largest private pension insurance 
company, serving 1.2 million people. No newcomer to 
ESG investing, Ilmarinen has made sustainability an 
integral part of its overall philosophy and investment 
strategy for decades. Recognizing the risks and 
opportunities of climate change, Ilmarinen has set 
ambitious targets to mitigate its impact. They hold 
about €50 billion in ESG-integrated investments and 
are in the process of reorienting their entire portfolio to 
solutions that are both sustainable and in line with 
performance objectives. 
One of the historical limitations to implementing a 
holistic sustainability strategy has been the lack of 
sustainable benchmarks and products. That’s changing 
with big advances in ESG data and analytics that have 
made it possible to assess companies through an ESG 
lens and evolve indexes to integrate climate 
considerations. Ilmarinen worked with BlackRock to 
build a foundation that aims to help them advance their 
total sustainable approach.

Solar power’s broad 
impact in Taiwan
As countries, corporations and investors redouble their 
commitments to reduce emissions, we believe the 
benefits will be far-reaching: from slowing climate 
change globally to boosting local economic growth to 
targeting long-term financial returns for key goals
like retirement.
We see opportunities on all these fronts in Asia, which is 
expected to generate over half of the world’s electricity 
by 2030 –the majority serviced by new renewables 
infrastructure. In Taiwan, for example, the government 
aims to generate 20% of the country’s electricity from 
renewables by 2025, including 20 gigawatts (GW) from 
solar. We made our first direct investments in Taiwanese 
solar projects in 2018 and have continued to build our 
portfolio there on behalf of our clients. To date, these 
investments encompass 42 projects, collectively 
providing 181 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy 
capacity and powering the equivalent of nearly 40,000 
homes annually. The projects also support nearly
600 jobs.  
The environmental impact is significant as well: in 
addition to avoiding 4.3 million metric tons of carbon 
annually, our solar projects save 11.7 million cubic 
meters of water that would be required for traditional 
power generation –thus contributing to the 
achievement of U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.

From garage start-up 
to big UK job creator
The investments we make on behalf of our clients can have 
a positive impact on the real economy: when companies 
grow, they generate not just investment returns but also 
contribute to economic prosperity in their communities.
The Hut Group (THG) is an end-to-end technology platform 
that takes beauty and wellness brands direct to consumers 
online. Based in Manchester, they are one of Britain’s 
biggest start-up successes. But it began, as many such 
companies do, in a garage with one person, founder
Matt Moulding. 
Nine years ago, BlackRock’s private credit investors saw 
THG’s potential and invested over £500 million. We have 
continued to be a key supporter of the company’s growth, 
helping them navigate important business decisions and 
connecting them with potential partners. Today, THG 
employs 8,000 people locally, with plans to build out a 
business campus that will employ 10,000 more.
Our partnership has been one of the key enablers of 
success for a significant employer in England’s North West.

Serving investors by 
serving customers
We believe that companies that consider all of their 
stakeholders —shareholders, customers, and employees –
have the potential to deliver strong long-term results
for investors. 
That trait is one of the things that drew us to Indonesia’s 
Bank Rakyat, a company that serves its investors by serving 
customers. Indonesia has a strong entrepreneurial culture, 
yet only half of its 275 million people have a bank account. 
Bank Rakyat gives many of them access to capital through 
microloans. Because its customers are dispersed, Rakyat 
reaches them through more than 500,000 independent 
agents, the only Indonesian bank to do so cost effectively.  
The company’s focus is on building customer trust as much 
or even more than maximizing profits for shareholders, in our 
view. During COVID-19, for example, they offered loan 
forbearance; even in normal times they are known to solve 
borrower problems over a cup of tea. Their approach is 
working: only 1% of its microloans defaulted, and it has 
turned in a higher return-on-equity than many developed 
market banks –showing how financial inclusion can also 
help deliver shareholder value. It’s an approach, and an 
outcome, aligned with BlackRock’s, which is one of the 
reasons we are a large investor in the bank.

Seeking local solutions 
for global challenges
BlackRock’s reach is broad but we’re also local, with 
16,500 employees participating in the communities where 
we work and live. 
We opened Atlanta Innovation Hub (iHub) in 2018 with a 
distinct objective: to investigate global financial challenges 
and work locally to leverage technology to find scalable 
solutions. Atlanta has a thriving tech sector, top universities 
and a diverse, skilled population. We set a target of hiring 
1,000 people in the next five years, the majority of whom 
would be local. 
Atlanta is also a city with large economic disparities. We 
have rolled out a strategy that connects social impact, 
university engagement, client outreach and employee 
involvement. Employees are encouraged to live their own 
purpose by giving back right at home. For example, we’re 
partnering with a local organization to teach financial 
literacy in schools, helping young people understand what 
it means to budget, save and invest. 
Atlanta is BlackRock’s sixth iHub–others are spread across 
the Americas, Europe and Asia. We see these locations as 
“laboratories” of our long-term commitment to make a 
difference in the communities where we operate while 
building our own future with diverse local talent.

Aligning investments 
with client principles 
One of the ways we support economic resilience is by meeting 
clients where they are –locally and truly understanding
their needs. 
Malaysia’s Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is one of the 
world’s oldest retirement funds, and serves the country's 
private sector workers. Many of EPF’s members are Muslim 
and would prefer to invest in alignment with Shariah 
principles. While EPF introduced the Shariah option for 
members in 2016, gaining access to Shariah-compliant 
private equity investments was a challenge. Fortunately, this 
was a gap we were able to fill: our private equity investment 
team is not only experienced but also diverse, including some 
Muslim members who had a deeper appreciation of Shariah 
principles. What’s more, we have been engaging with 
Malaysian investors for more than two decades. 
The team worked tirelessly with EPF and our Shariah advisors 
to combine our deep global alternatives expertise with Shariah 
investment principles, through an innovative co-investment 
structure. The result: the world’s first and largest Shariah-
compliant private equity mandate, helping millions of 
Malaysians save and invest for the future, in a way that aligns 
with their beliefs.

Our commitment to 
global net zero by 2050
Our commitments*
In January 2021, BlackRock outlined an ambitious set of commitments 
to support the transition to a net zero economy: one that by 2050 will 
emit no more carbon than it removes from the atmosphere.  Data, disclosure and metrics are key to advancing the net zero 
transition, which is why our 2021 commitments include:
Our goals, shown to the right, build on commitments we made in 
January 2020 to make sustainable investing our standard. They lay out

Sustainable
operations
BlackRock continues to take steps to evolve our operations and 
standards to meet the commitments we’ve outlined. To date we 
are 100% carbon neutral across all BlackRock corporate 
operations. We achieved this by employing energy efficiency 
strategies, meeting our 100% renewable energy goal, and 
offsetting emissions we could not otherwise eliminate.
Additionally, as a participant of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) BlackRock supports the UNGC 10 principles 
and has taken steps to embed these into our own standards which 
we make available through our disclosure reporting.
