Report of Directors 
General information  
AEGON Investment Management B.V. (further: ‘the Company’ or AIM) is a private limited liability 
company organised under Dutch law and recorded in the Commercial Register of The Hague 
under its registered address at Aegonplein 50, 2591 TV The Hague. AIM is registered under 
number 27075825 in the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries for 
Haaglanden, The Hague, The Netherlands. The principal activities of the Company are that of 
management of investment funds and individual portfolio management and investment advice. 
The  Company  is  incorporated  and  domiciled  in  the  Netherlands  and  is  regulated  by  De 
Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM). The Company is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of AEGON Asset Management Holding B.V., The Hague.  
The Company’s mission is to use its investment management expertise to help people achieve 
a lifetime of financial security. The Company’s investment management expertise is aimed at a 
wide variety of client groups such as institutional clients as well as retail customers in both the 
Netherlands as well as more broadly in Pan Europe. 
 
Performance of the Company and developments during the year 
Performance of the Company 
The Company delivered a profit after tax of EUR 16.9 million (2018: profit of EUR 14.6 million). 
The result over 2019  was slightly behind Directors’ expectations for 2019, but a growth 
compared to the previous year. Total income and cost increased compared to 2018, reflecting 
the continued growth of the Company. 
Revenues predominantly consist of management fees earned from the management of assets 
for affiliated insurance companies as well as external clients and service fees charged to the 
investment funds to cover for certain expenses. Fees from management assets for affiliated 
insurance companies are lower compared to previous year. Fees from Third party clients are 
higher compared to previous year due to the growth of the assets managed by the Company. 
The main expenses of the Company are personnel expenses, investment management services 
fees, IT expenses and intercompany recharges. The higher costs compared to the previous year 
are mainly driven by higher personnel expenses and discretionary costs. The aforementioned 
developments led to a profit after tax of EUR 16.9 million.  
As at 31 December 2019, the Company’s equity amounted to EUR 60.5 million. Eligible capital 
amounted to EUR 37.5 million compared to the minimum capital required of EUR 30.8 million. 
The Company’s solvency and liquidity position can be characterized as robust. The capital 
position throughout the year complies with the capital requirements and the majority of the 
assets are liquid. As a result, there is no funding need. 
Developments of the Company during the year 
TKP Investments B.V. (TKPI) was merged with Aegon Investment Management B.V. on January 
1, 2019, to form one single legal entity in the Netherlands. Integration of the two companies 
was a logical step towards increasing our economies of scale, operational efficiency and levels 
of innovation in a highly competitive market. It will, for example, make it easier to implement 
processes and automation, reduce costs and comply with new laws and regulatory requirements. 
The total opening Asset under Management (AuM) as a result of the merger increased with EUR 
25.0 billion from EUR 71.4 billion to EUR 96.4 billion. The fixed income assets increased with 
 
5 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
EUR 10.9 billion from EUR 60.0 billion to EUR 70.9 billion. The equity assets under management 
including real estate assets under management increased with EUR 11.2 billion from EUR 9.6 
billion to EUR 20.8 billion. The alternative investments increased with EUR 2.9 billion from EUR 
1.8 billion to EUR 4.7 billion.  
The purpose of the legal merger was to simplify the governance and improve decision making. 
A Steering Committee has led the project that ultimately resulted in the legal merger. Many of 
the supporting functions, like HR, Finance, and Risk, have been successfully merged in 2019, 
and are now operating in a more efficient way. Following this legal merger, an initiative is now 
underway to integrate the operational landscape of the fiduciary business with the wider Aegon 
Asset Management organization as a result of which the Company expects to achieve synergies. 
Furthermore, the Company has expanded its third party client base further by combining growth 
in The Netherlands with attracting new clients from outside of The Netherlands, for example, 
Germany and Southern Europe. This has resulted in an increase of our third party assets of over 
EUR 3.9 billion. During 2019, the Company has also launched a number of new propositions, 
which are expected to contribute to further growth of our asset base.  
Investment performance over the full year was reasonable. A number of capabilities performed 
well during the year and some others (mainly in the core fixed income area) did not perform as 
well as expected. From an operational perspective, the Company completed a number of actions 
aimed at upgrading its infrastructure, client service, reducing complexity and enhancing the 
quality of data and IT. Furthermore, the Company made further steps in implementing an agile 
way of working. 
Developments of the Company in the wider global Aegon Asset Management organisation 
At the end of 2019, it has been decided to replace the regional executive committees (e.g. the 
European Executive Committee that existed during the period 1/1/2018 to 31/1/2020 and that 
had been delegated by the AIM board to run its day to day business) with a single global 
management board. It has also been decided to move to a global functional structure, establish 
four investment platforms (being fixed income, real assets, equity and multi assets & solutions), 
a single global profit and loss account, compensation pool and one global brand, which will be 
Aegon Asset Management (AAM). To ensure that the legal entity strategy execution is aligned 
with AAM’s overall strategy, CEO’s of AAM’s key legal entities such as AIM are members of the 
AAM Global Management Board. Within the AAM organization, the AIM Board is responsible to 
conduct business in the manner agreed and determined by the Global Management Board of 
AAM and in line with the AAM Global Strategy. The AIM Board may decide to delegate specific 
responsibilities relating to the execution of AIM Board decisions and strategy to AAM Global 
committees. 
General market developments 
Economic growth in the Eurozone slowed down in 2019. The economy was impacted negatively 
by the trade war between the US and China. Especially, economies with large manufacturing 
sectors, like Germany and Italy, were impacted. Also structural challenges in the automotive 
sector resulted in a significant economic drag. Germany and Italy only barely avoided a recession 
in the second half of 2019.  
Also the inability of the UK and the EU to agree on a Brexit deal resulted in lower investment 
and lower exports to the UK.  After new elections in the UK at the end of 2019, the government 
had a sufficient majority to ratify a deal with the EU. This resulted in a formal exit in January 
2020.  
Despite the slowdown in the manufacturing sector, the services sector has performed well. Also 
unemployment in the Eurozone has declined further and is now at pre-credit crisis lows.

The ECB reinstated its QE programme and cut its deposit rate to -0.5% in response to the 
weakening external outlook and the lack of inflationary pressures.  
Under these circumstances fixed income assets under management increased from EUR 70.9 
billion to EUR 80.8 billion. There was a positive market movement of EUR 5.7 billion and a net 
inflow of EUR 4.2 billion. 
Equity assets under management including real estate asset under management increased from 
EUR 20.8 billion to EUR 24.6 billion at year end. There was a positive market movement 
amounting to EUR 4.3 billion and a net outflow of assets of EUR 0.5 billion. 
Alternative investments asset under management (consisting of for instance the derivatives and 
hedging book and private equity investments) increased from EUR 4.7 billion to EUR 6.2 billion. 
There was a positive market movement of EUR 2.4 billion and a net outflow of EUR 0.9 billion. 
On an aggregate level, the Company’s total assets under management has increased from EUR 
96.4 billion as per the beginning of the year to EUR 111.7 billion as per the end of the year. 
Responsible investment 
Aegon Asset Management believes in active and responsible managed investments. For Aegon 
Asset Management, Responsible Investment is about making sure that Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) factors are taken into account in investment decisions. By taking an 
active approach when considering ESG issues in its investment decisions, engaging with investee 
companies  based  on  global  and  responsible  investment  policy-related  standards  and  by 
exercising its shareholder rights, Aegon Asset Management reduces risks and explores new 
opportunities  to  serve  its  clients’  interests  and  those  of  society  at  large.  Aegon  Asset 
Management publishes an annual Responsible Investment Report which outlines how its take on 
responsible investment was put into practice in the reported period and how the company dealt 
with key sustainability issues in relation to its managed investments. The report demonstrates 
Aegon Asset Management’s commitment to integrate non-financial factors into its investment 
decision-making  processes  and  its  support  for  sustainable  finance.  For  more  detailed 
information, we refer to the Aegon Asset Management 2019 Responsible Investment Report. 
Corporate governance, capital management and financial instruments 
The Company has established a governance framework for monitoring and overseeing strategy, 
conduct of business standards and operations of the business across the group that includes a 
clearly  stated  corporate  organisational  structure,  appropriate  delegated  authorities  and 
independent internal audit and risk management functions. Risk management for the Company 
operates within this governance framework.   
The Company operates a formal risk management framework to assess financial, operational 
and business risks and mitigating controls. In addition, the Company reviews risks as part of its 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. The Directors consider that the Company is 
subject largely to market risk, reputational risk and operational risk. The ICAAP process ensures 
that after taking account of mitigating actions, the Company maintains a level of capital that is 
appropriate for the risks it faces. 
–  Market risk considers the impact of significant falls in both equity and bond markets on 
assets under management and fee income. 
–  Reputational risk considers the impact of events such as potential poor investment 
performance or poor service delivery on sales and withdrawals. 
–  Operational risk considers the impact of inadequate or failed operational processes, which 
may impact in terms of higher costs and also cause reputational damage.  
The Company's objective in managing its capital is to ensure that there are adequate resources 
to meet the Company's liabilities as they fall due, and to allocate capital efficiently to support 
 
7 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
growth. The Company manages its capital by measuring its resources and cash available on a 
regular basis.  
The Company is regulated by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and Autoriteit Financiële Markten 
(AFM). The Company maintains capital in line with the requirements from DNB. The Company 
reports its capital position to DNB on a quarterly basis.  
The Company is not exposed to significant financial instrument risk. Financial instruments held 
by the Company comprise of trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits. Credit risk is 
relatively low as assets are primarily cash and short-term deposits, which are placed with 
major banks of acceptable credit standing and with a degree of diversification. 
Risk Management 
General 
The Company operates within the requirements of the Operational Risk Management Policy of 
AEGON Group. This policy sets out the principles and methodologies to identify, assess and 
manage risk. The Company complements this with a robust control framework, overseen via a 
monthly control meeting cycle, which culminates in the monthly Risk and Control Committee 
meeting. The Company also applies other policies setting out the standards that hold specifically 
for AAM and/or that apply to specific subjects (e.g. Conflicts of interest, Personal account 
dealing, Gifts & Hospitality).  
The Risk Tolerance of the Company is defined in line with the methodology of the Operational 
Risk Management Policy of AEGON and is updated on an annual basis. The Company is primarily 
exposed to operational risks and to a lesser extent to financial risks. 
Operational Risk  
Operational risk is the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal or external 
processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company seeks to minimize 
operational risk events and has no tolerance for single event related losses exceeding EUR 10.0 
million more frequently than once every 10 years and has no tolerance for single event related 
losses exceeding EUR 0.5 million more frequently than once every 12 months. The Company 
has an Enterprise Risk Management department which facilitates identification of operational 
risk by line management, manages risk events and monitors follow up of issues and actions. 
The Key control framework is maintained by line management. Effectiveness of key controls is 
tested by the Controls & MI team that operates independently within the COO domain. The 
operational risk profile of the Company is discussed quarterly in the Global Risk and Control 
Committee by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and members of the Management Board. 
Legal & compliance risk 
Legal & Compliance risk is defined as the risk that losses occur resulting from non-voluntary 
legal liabilities, inadequate legal documentation; or products, services, people and actions failing 
to deliver the reasonable expectations of its customers and other stakeholders; or failure to 
comply  with  laws,  regulations  and  internal  company  rules  and  policies,  as  well  as  late 
identification of significant and potential legal and regulatory developments. This includes the 
risk of failure to comply with established good business practices and expectations of key 
stakeholders such as customers, employees and society as a whole. The Company has a 
dedicated  Legal  department  that  actively  identifies  and  addresses  developments  in  the 
regulatory  environment  and  translates  this  into  a  regulatory  calendar.  The  Company’s 
Compliance department also has a monitoring program in place to monitor compliance with 
laws, regulation and internal policies.

Financial Risk  
The main financial risks are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, with the principal elements 
of market risk being interest rate risk and equity price risk. In addition to the financial risks, the 
Company has identified group risk. The Company is not exposed to significant currency risk 
other than through exposure to the funds it manages.  The Corporate governance, capital 
management and financial instruments section of the Report of the Directors describes the 
Company’s general approach to risk management and the management of financial risks. 
Credit Risk  
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty defaults on contractual or other agreed obligations 
(including supplied credits, loans, claims and received warranties) whether or not as a result of 
being subject to limitations of foreign payments. The policy of the Company is not to carry out 
credit activities, hence the main credit risk is concentrated around the bank accounts we use. 
There is a very small risk within the Company of not being able to collect management fees from 
the funds the Company manages. The Company considers that the exposure to credit risk is 
limited given the prior experience where the Company has not had to write off any significant 
bad debts over the past 10 years.  
A counterparty management policy is in place which limits the maximum amount of our own 
funds which the Company deposits with individual banks. During normal market conditions a 
bank balance above the Company’s internal set minimum of EUR 15 million will be deposited at 
a minimum of two counterparties with a high credit rating. This ensures that the Company 
engages with a minimum of three counterparties at all times and thereby limiting the risk in this 
area. 
The Company offers standard industry credit terms to clients. The credit risk to clients is very 
limited as the fee income is related to funds and Aegon Nederland N.V. The credit risk relates 
to the clients of the Company (not related to Aegon Nederland N.V.) with a discretionary 
portfolio. On average the fee income from the clients of the Company with a discretionary 
portfolio represent a marginal amount of the total fee income. As the risk is insignificant the 
Company accepts this risk. The third party growth strategy could lead to an increasing number 
of discretionary portfolios and consequently a higher amount of receivables on which credit risk 
applies.  
Aged items are monitored by the Finance team of the Company and action is taken to recover 
such debts (through deduction from client assets if appropriate). The Company does not impose 
restrictions on the size of such debts, but aims to collect them in a timely way, thus reducing 
the amount of capital required to cover them.  The Company has no appetite for on-balance 
sheet trading activity that might create counterparty risk.  
Details of these balances are listed under notes 5, 6 and 7 of the notes to the financial 
statements. 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk considers the probability that insufficient cash is available to fulfil obligations. 
Liabilities that require liquid capital from the Company are in relation to operating expenses and 
the Company has a liquidity policy requiring a minimum level of working capital that enables it 
to manage liquidity risk.  The key feature of this policy is that the Company is required to hold 
liquid capital to cover at least 3 months expenditure on a continuous basis. In practice liquid 
assets are considerably higher than this. The Company monitors the composition of the balance 
sheet as well as the size of the balance sheet. The Company reviews the cash balances available 
to make payments as they fall due. The review of the future forecasts shows that the Company 
is able to maintain sufficient liquid assets to meet its liabilities. Details of these balances are 
listed under notes 10, 11 and 12 of the notes to the financial statements.

    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
Market Risk 
Market risk is the risk resulting from exposure to changes in market prices of tradable financial 
instruments within a portfolio. The Company does not have a complex balance sheet. The 
balance sheet consists largely of cash and short-term assets and liabilities and all client assets 
are held separately off-balance sheet for the risk of clients. With the exception of the possibility 
of holding seed capital positions in certain circumstances, it is policy of the Company that 
investments are not carried out for its own account and therefore the direct exposure to market 
risk is limited. Currently, the Company does not hold any seed capital positions.  
The Company is exposed to indirect market risk caused by fluctuations in the wider financial 
markets that will affect the valuation of the assets that the Company manages. The Company 
is therefore subject to indirect market risk through market impacts on fee income. Although the 
Company retains the ability to hedge this risk in certain situations the Company generally 
considers it uncontrollable, as it is inherent in the business of asset management. In practice, 
the exposure to this risk is diversified, to a degree, by having significant exposure to both bonds 
and equities.  
Group Risk 
The Company is part of the Aegon N.V. Group and within this is a member of the Aegon Asset 
Management Group and is thus subject to group risk. This is inherent to our organisational 
structure. Group risk may impact us in a number of ways:  
  potential financial or reputational difficulties at Group level 
  the Group’s control over our actions or spending power  
  Group actions such as takeover activity or strategic announcements (considered to be 
an inherent risk but mitigated through close communication). 
The Company considers the benefits of membership of Aegon outweigh these potential risks. A 
key benefit of group membership is that capital and liquidity support over and above the 
Company’s own capital requirement could be available as an additional buffer, depending on 
circumstances. 
Creditor payment policy 
The objective is to treat suppliers fairly and in accordance with good commercial practice. 
Suppliers' invoices are settled in accordance with agreed contractual terms or, if no terms are 
scheduled, generally within 30 days of the appropriate invoice date. 
Outlook 
A new type of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. This virus can cause a 
disease  known  as  COVID-19.  The  majority  of  patients  experience  fever  and  respiratory 
problems. The virus has emerged in many countries worldwide and measures have been 
implemented to stop its spread. The outbreak of the coronavirus and its spread in 2020 has 
affected financial markets across the globe. In March 2020 worldwide markets have fallen by 
double digit percentages due to a significant rise in uncertainty.  
The outlook of the financial markets is extraordinarily uncertain. The effect of the crisis and the 
economic recession that follows are expected to have a significant impact our client portfolio’s. 
The developments will result in lower fee income and profitability. Whether revenues and 
profitability will improve in the remainder of 2020 is dependent on the period during which the 
regions in which we operate are exposed to COVID-19 and the extent to which government 
 
10 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
measures may be prolonged, expanded or scaled down. Despite the extraordinarily uncertain 
times the Company is well positioned to deal with these challenging circumstances. 
The Company believes vigilance to be key in times of turbulent markets. We carefully keep track 
of market developments, investment fund transactions and quotes to ensure our clients receive 
valuations and reports that provide an accurate reflection of current market circumstances. This 
entails that we keep a close eye on markets’ reactions to policy changes by the central bank 
and market interventions by governments. We monitor indicators of market sentiment and 
adjust our portfolios accordingly to profit of opportunities when these may arise.  
The Company is part of the Aegon Asset Management Global organization that operates from a 
diverse set of locations in Europe, the United States and Asia. This allows us to be well positioned 
for and give assurance of continued operations during periods of local or regional disruption. 
The company has implemented a series of measures to minimize the impact of the coronavirus 
on our clients, including intensive monitoring of governance and operations and work-from-
home policies as part of business continuity plans. 
The Events in early 2020 will give no new insights into the valuation of assets and liabilities of 
the Company as per 31 December 2019. The management board of the Company have adopted 
a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Relevant facts and circumstances 
relating to the financial position as per 31 December 2019 were assessed in order to reach our 
conclusion that there is no material uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going 
concern. The main area assessed was the COVID-19 impact on the Company’s business activities 
and financial performance. The Company has also assessed the impact of the financial markets 
on its revenues and concluded that the drop-in revenues does not jeopardize the viability of the 
company.  
Management and Supervision Act 
As of 1 January 2013, a new Management and Supervision Act came into effect. The new act 
requires large sized B.V.s such as the Company to have as far as possible a balanced distribution 
on their Board with at least 30% of the seats occupied by women and at least 30% by men. 
Looking at the year-end 2019 situation, the Company did not comply with this requirement 
(approximately 13% of the Board was occupied by women). In 2020 however and as part of the 
next steps in the globalization, the number of Board members has been reduced to 3 of which 
1 is female. As a result, 33% of board seats are occupied by women at the date of signing of 
these financial statements.

Notes to the financial statements 
1.  General information 
Aegon Investment Management B.V. (the Company) is an Investment Management Company, 
incorporated and domiciled in the Netherlands. The Company is a private limited liability share 
company organised under Dutch law and recorded in the Commercial Register of The Hague, 
Chamber of Commerce number 27075825, under its registered address at Aegonplein 50, 2591 
TV The Hague. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegon Asset Management Holding 
B.V.  with  the  ultimate  parent  company  being  Aegon  N.V.,  which  is  incorporated  in  the 
Netherlands. 
The principal activities of the Company are management of investment funds, individual portfolio 
management and investment advice. The Company is the manager of Aegon Paraplufonds I 
whose sub funds are registered with the Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The Company 
is also the manager of alternative investment funds (AIFs) (which are also regulated and 
registered with the AFM) and of non-registered funds and pools. These non-registered (and non-
regulated) funds are only offered to Aegon entities. 
During 2018 the Company launched and executed an initiative to merge with affiliated entity 
TKP Investments B.V. within the global Aegon Asset Management (AAM) organisation in order 
to simplify the governance and improve decision making. This legal merger was effectuated as 
per 1 January 2019 and as per this date the Company merged the net assets of TKP Investments 
B.V.  
The Company outsourced part of the asset management activities to BlackRock Advisors (UK) 
Limited,  Saemor  Capital  B.V.,  Pelargos  Capital  B.V.,  Kames  Capital  plc  and  Aegon  USA 
Investment Management LLC. Except for BlackRock Advisors (UK) Limited, these companies are 
part of the Aegon Group. 
The Company outsourced the administration of the funds and pools to Citi Fund Services 
(Ireland) Limited. 
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies 
General concepts of accounting principles 
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands and with the financial reporting 
requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
The financial statements are denominated in euros, unless otherwise stated. This is both the 
functional  currency  and  presentation  currency  of  the  Company.  Assets  and  liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the rates prevailing 
at the date of the related transaction. Exchange differences that arise from settlement or 
translations of monetary items are recorded in the profit and loss account. 
Unless otherwise stated, all other assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. In the balance sheet, profit and loss account and the 
cash flow statement, references are made to the notes. 
All amounts are reported in thousands of euros unless otherwise stated.

Legal merger between the Company and TKP Investments B.V. 
The legal merger between AIM and TKPI as per 1 January 2019 is classified as uniting of 
interests. Both companies are under common control of Aegon Asset Management Holding B.V. 
The Company did not pay a purchase price. There was no cash flow and goodwill was not created. 
As such the legal merger is accounted for using the pooling of interest method. The pooling of 
interests method of accounting involves consolidating the balance sheets of AIM and TKPI into 
one balance sheet based on book values. On 1 January 2019 the assets and liabilities based on 
book value of the two companies were added together and netted. The equity of TKPI has been 
included in the other reserves of the Company. The comparative amounts have been restated. 
The TKPI assets of EUR 29,984, the liabilities of EUR 6,670, the equity of EUR 23,314 and the 
result of EUR 5,002 have been included on a line by line basis in comparatives amounts of the 
Company. 
Comparison with previous year 
The valuation principles and method of determining the result are the same as those used in 
the previous year. 
Following  the  legal  merger  and  the  pooling  of  interest  method  as  described  above  the 
comparative amounts have been restated to include the comparative amounts of TKPI. The 
comparative amounts as per 31 December 2018 of the Company and TKPI have been added on 
a line by line basis. 
The comparative amounts have been restated for the revenues in line with the use of the 
principle  agent  method.  The  net  management  fee  of  EUR  87,843  has  been  divided  in 
management fee of EUR 96,815 and  management fee expense of EUR (8,972) and the net 
service fee of EUR (334) has been divided in service fee of EUR 10,841 and service fee expense 
EUR (11,175). The breakdown of the amounts were provided in the notes of the prior year 
financial statements. 
Further the comparatives have been adjusted for the legal reserve in the balance sheet and the 
corresponding note. The legal reserve for intangible assets of EUR 5,600 has been separated 
from the other reserves. The comparatives in the cash flow statements have been changed to 
separate the investment cash flow in tangible assets of EUR 119 and intangible fixes assets of 
EUR 1,498. 
Accounting principles 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets consist of purchased capitalised software costs. Intangible assets are stated 
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses determined 
individually for each asset. A periodic impairment test is performed on assets that are in use 
and on assets that have not been fully implemented or are not fully in operation. 
Amortisation starts when the asset is in use. The amortisation is calculated using the straight-
line method over the expected useful economic life of the intangible assets, not exceeding a 
period of five years. 
   
 
17 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
Tangible assets 
Tangible  assets  are  valued  at  historical  cost  less  straight-line  accumulated  depreciation. 
Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated using fixed percentages of the historic purchase 
cost and based upon the economic life of the asset. 
Impairment of assets 
On each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there are any indications that a 
fixed asset may be subject to impairment. If there are such indications, the recoverable amount 
of  the  asset  is  determined.  If  it is not possible  to determine the  recoverable  amount of 
the individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs is determined. An impairment occurs when the carrying amount of an asset is higher 
than the recoverable amount; the recoverable amount is the higher of the realisable value and 
the value in use.  
An impairment loss is directly recognised in the profit and loss account while the carrying amount 
of the asset concerned is concurrently reduced.  
The realisable value is initially based on a binding sale agreement; if there is no such agreement, 
the realisable value is determined based on the active market, whereby usually the prevailing 
bid price is taken as market price. The costs deducted in determining net realizable value are 
based on the estimated costs that are directly attributable to the sale and are necessary to 
realize the sale. For the determination of the value in use, an estimate is made of the future net 
cash flows in the event of continued use of the asset or cash-generating unit. 
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. 
Intercompany receivables, trade receivables, prepayments and other receivables   
Intercompany receivables, trade receivables, prepayments and other receivables are recognised 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless stated otherwise. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash at banks and in hand represent cash in hand, bank balances and deposits with terms of 
less than three months. Cash at banks and in hand is carried at nominal value. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables, bonus reservations and intercompany payables are initially measured 
at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised for legally enforceable or constructive obligations that exist at the 
balance sheet date, and for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required and 
a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount 
that is necessary to settle the obligation as per the balance sheet date. The provision concerns 
a restructuring provision resulting from some organisational changes that were implemented in 
2018. The amount accounted for reflects payables for contract terminations.

Principles for the determination of the result 
The result is the difference between the realisable value of the services provided and the costs 
and other charges during the year. The result on transactions are recognised in the year in which 
they are realised. 
Operational lease 
Leases that do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases, where the Company is the lessee, are 
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to 
the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value 
of the consideration received. 
Principal – agent method 
The Company recognises management fees as revenues in line with principal-agent method. 
Based on management assessment, the Company operates as principal in relation to the sub 
advised services provided to the AIM asset management clients. As a principal AIM recognises 
and presents the total gross contractual fees for the provided services as revenue.   
Management fees, service fees and performance fees 
Management fees and service fees comprises the fair value of the service rendered in the 
ordinary course of the Company’s activities. The company recognises management and service 
fees in the accounting period in which the service is provided. Management fees for the funds 
are calculated on the fund’s net asset value using pre-determined percentages disclosed in the 
fund’s prospectus. The same principle applies for the service fees that are charged to the funds 
to cover for administrative, custody and other operational expenses. For institutional clients with 
an individual investment mandate the management fees are calculated over the quarterly 
average net asset value.  
Performance fees are calculated as a percentage of the performance of the relevant assets under 
management and recorded when earned. 
Management fee expenses and service fee expenses 
Management fee expenses comprise of sub advisory costs which are payable to third parties and 
related parties. These costs are recorded when the service has been provided and is based on 
predetermined percentages of average net asset under management. The service fee expenses 
comprise of administration, custody, depository, supervision, external reporting, registration, 
independent auditor and bank expenses which are charged to the Company by external parties. 
Other operating expenses 
Costs are determined on a historical basis and are attributed to the reporting year to which they 
relate. 
 
 
19 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
Other income and expenses 
Other income and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. 
 
Incentive plans 
Share-based  bonuses  are  long-term  share  and  cash  incentive  plans  awarded  to  eligible 
employees and are accounted for over the period between the date of award and the date of 
vesting. For employees marked as Identified Staff (IS), the variable remuneration consists of a 
50% upfront payment in cash and a 50% deferred payment in cash (based on cliff vesting) with 
the NAV of a reference portfolio determining the ultimate pay out. Due to the implementation 
of Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) in 2014, as of 2015 share based 
bonus plans are no longer based on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV. Up to the 
implementation of AIFMD, eligible employees receive shares of Aegon N.V. A condition for 
payment of deferred rights in the future is that employees remain employed within the Aegon 
N.V. organisation. As of 2015, share based bonuses are granted in phantom shares which is a 
fictional instrument. At the date of vesting the fictional phantom shares will be paid out in cash. 
Corporation tax 
Corporation taxes are computed by applying the current tax rate to the result for the financial 
year, taking account of the losses available for set-off from previous financial years (to the 
extent that they have not already been included in the deferred tax assets) and adjusted for 
exempted sources of income and tax allowances. Due account is also taken of changes which 
occur in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in respect of changes in the applicable 
tax rate. 
Cash flow statement 
The cash flow statement was prepared using the indirect method. The cash items disclosed in 
the cash flow statement comprise cash at banks and in hand, except for deposits with a maturity 
longer than three months. Cash flows denominated in foreign currencies have been translated 
at average estimated exchange rates. Interest paid and received, dividends received and income 
taxes are included in cash from operating activities. Investment in intangible fixed assets and 
tangible fixed assets are recognised as cash used in investment activities. Dividends paid are 
recognised as cash used in financing activities. Transactions not resulting in inflow or outflow of 
cash are not recognised in the cash flow statement. 
Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of annual financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that 
affect the recognition and valuation of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
as of the date of the annual financial statements and the reported amounts of income and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of current events and actions, the actual results may differ ultimately from these 
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Restructuring provision 
The reorganization plans are communicated with the employees in several ways, making a 
justified expectation by the employee that the reorganization will take place. Different parts of 
the reorganisation are already set in motion as at balance sheet date. The restructuring provision 
concerns commitments related to job placement services and the discharge of employees. A 
change in assumption and estimates may affect the actual costs of the restructuring, including 
choice of outflow and time 
Management fees 
The Company recognises management fees as revenues in line with principal-agent method. 
Based on management assessment, the Company operates as principal in relation to the sub 
advised services provided to the AIM asset management clients. As a principal AIM recognises 
and presents the total gross contractual fees for the provided services as revenue.  
Useful lives of tangible and intangible assets 
The Company reviews the estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets at the end of 
each reporting period. Currently the useful lives are determined as follows: 
-  Computer & equipment: 3 years 
-  Furniture & equipment: 4 years 
-  Leasehold improvements: 5 years 
-  Intangibles: 2-5 years 
Proposed appropriation of result

23.  Risk Management 
General 
The Company operates within the requirements of the Operational Risk Management Policy of 
AEGON Group. This policy sets out the principles and methodologies to identify, assess and 
manage risk. The Company complements this with a robust control framework, overseen via a 
monthly control meeting cycle, which culminates in the monthly Risk and Control Committee 
meeting. The Company also applies  other policies setting out the standards that hold specifically 
for AAM and/or that apply to specific subjects (e.g. Conflicts of interest, Personal account 
dealing, Gifts & Hospitality).  
The Risk Tolerance of the Company is defined in line with the methodology of the Operational 
Risk Management Policy of AEGON and is updated on an annual basis. The Company is primarily 
exposed to operational risks and to a lesser extent to financial risks. 
Operational Risk  
Operational risk is the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal or external 
processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company seeks to minimize 
operational risk events and has no tolerance for single event related losses exceeding EUR 10.0 
million more frequently than once every 10 years and has no tolerance for single event related 
losses exceeding EUR 0.5 million more frequently than once every 12 months. The Company 
has an Enterprise Risk Management department which facilitates identification of operational 
risk by line management, manages risk events and monitors follow up of issues and actions. 
The Key control framework is maintained by line management. Effectiveness of key controls is 
tested by the Controls & MI team that operates independently within the COO domain. The 
Operational Risk profile of the Company is discussed quarterly in the Global Risk and Control 
Committee by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and global Management Board. 
Legal & compliance risk 
Legal & Compliance risk is defined as the risk that losses occur resulting from non-voluntary 
legal liabilities, inadequate legal documentation; or products, services, people and actions failing 
to deliver the reasonable expectations of its customers and other stakeholders; or failure to 
comply  with  laws,  regulations  and  internal  company  rules  and  policies,  as  well  as  late 
identification of significant and potential legal and regulatory developments. This includes the 
risk of failure to comply with established good business practices and expectations of key 
stakeholders such as customers, employees and society as a whole. The Company has a 
dedicated  Legal  department  that  actively  identifies  and  addresses  developments  in  the 
regulatory  environment  and  translates  this  into  a  regulatory  calendar.  The  Company’s 
Compliance department also has a monitoring program in place to monitor compliance with 
laws, regulation and internal policies. 
Financial Risk  
The main financial risks are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, with the principal elements 
of market risk being interest rate risk and equity price risk. In addition to the financial risks, the 
Company has identified group risk. The Company is not exposed to significant currency risk 
other than through exposure to the funds it manages.  The Corporate governance, capital 
management and financial instruments section of the Report of the Directors describes the 
Company’s general approach to risk management and the management of financial risks. 
   
 
32 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
Credit Risk  
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty defaults on contractual or other agreed obligations 
(including supplied credits, loans, claims and received warranties) whether or not as a result of 
being subject to limitations of foreign payments. The policy of the Company is not to carry out 
credit activities. There is a very small risk within the Company of not being able to collect 
management fees from the funds the Company manages. The Company considers that the 
exposure to credit risk is limited given the prior experience where the Company has not had to 
write off any significant bad debts over the past 10 years.  
A counterparty management policy is in place which limits the maximum amount of our own 
funds which the Company deposits with individual banks. During normal market conditions a 
bank balance above the Company’s internal set minimum of EUR 15 million will be deposited at 
a minimum of two counterparties with a high credit rating. This ensures that the Company 
engages with a minimum of three counterparties at all times and thereby limiting the risk in this 
area. 
The Company offers standard industry credit terms to clients. The credit risk to clients is very 
limited as the fee income is related to funds and Aegon Nederland N.V. The credit risk relates 
to the clients of the Company (not related to Aegon Nederland N.V.) with a discretionary 
portfolio. On average the fee income from the clients of the Company with a discretionary 
portfolio represent a marginal amount of the total fee income. As the risk is insignificant the 
Company accepts this risk. The third party growth strategy could lead to an increasing number 
of discretionary portfolios and consequently a higher amount of receivables on which credit risk 
applies.  
Aged items are monitored by the Finance team of the Company and action is taken to recover 
such debts (through deduction from client assets if appropriate). The Company does not impose 
restrictions on the size of such debts, but aims to collect them in a timely way, thus reducing 
the amount of capital required to cover them.  The Company has no appetite for on-balance 
sheet trading activity that might create counterparty risk.  
Details of these balances are listed under notes 5, 6 and 7 of the notes to the financial 
statements. 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk considers the probability that insufficient cash is available to fulfil obligations. 
Liabilities that require liquid capital from the Company are in relation to operating expenses and 
the Company has a liquidity policy requiring a minimum level of working capital that enables it 
to manage liquidity risk.  The key feature of this policy is that the Company is required to hold 
liquid capital to cover at least 3 months expenditure on a continuous basis. In practice liquid 
assets are considerably higher than this.  
The Company monitors the composition of the balance sheet as well as the size of the balance 
sheet. The Company reviews the cash balances available to make payments as they fall due. 
The review of the future forecasts shows that the Company is able to maintain sufficient liquid 
assets to meet its liabilities. 
Details of these balances are listed under notes 10, 11 and 12 of the notes to the financial 
statements. 
   
 
33 
    Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
 
 
 
Market Risk 
Market risk is the risk resulting from exposure to changes in market prices of tradable financial 
instruments within a portfolio. The Company does not have a complex balance sheet. The 
balance sheet consists largely of cash and short-term assets and liabilities and all client assets 
are held separately off-balance sheet for the risk of clients. With the exception of the possibility 
of holding seed capital positions in certain circumstances, it is policy of the Company that 
investments are not carried out for its own account and therefore the direct exposure to market 
risk is limited. Currently, the Company does not hold any seed capital positions.  
The Company is exposed to indirect market risk caused by fluctuations in the wider financial 
markets that will affect the valuation of the assets that the Company manages. The Company 
is therefore subject to indirect market risk through market impacts on fee income. Although the 
Company retains the ability to hedge this risk in certain situations the Company generally 
considers it uncontrollable, as it is inherent in the business of asset management. In practice, 
the exposure to this risk is diversified, to a degree, by having significant exposure to both bonds 
and equities.  
Group Risk 
The Company is part of the Aegon N.V. Group and within this is a member of the Aegon Asset 
Management Group and is thus subject to group risk. This is inherent to our organisational 
structure. Group risk may impact us in a number of ways:  
  potential financial or reputational difficulties at Group level 
  the Group’s control over our actions or spending power  
  Group actions such as takeover activity or strategic announcements (considered to be 
an inherent risk but mitigated through close communication). 
The Company considers the benefits of membership of Aegon outweigh these potential risks. A 
key benefit of group membership is that capital and liquidity support over and above the 
Company’s own capital requirement could be available as an additional buffer, depending on 
circumstances.  
24.  Number of employees 
Aegon Nederland N.V. employs all staff that work for the Company, and as such the Company 
had no direct employees during the years 2019 and 2018. The number of average FTE that work 
for the Company in 2019 is 329.3 (2018: 326.5). All employees that work for the Company are 
based in the Netherlands.

25.  Directors’ remuneration 
During the financial year 7 Directors held office (2018: 7). The total remuneration of the 
Directors in respect of their service to the Company was as follows: 
       2019    2018 
Statutory directors on payroll in the Netherlands       1,954    1,870 
Statutory directors not on payroll in the Netherlands       108    85 
Salaries, pension, bonuses and other benefits       2,062    1,955 
26.  Contingent liabilities 
Operational lease 
The term of the lease for the property on Europaweg in Groningen is until May 16, 2021. The 
lease commitment amounts to EUR 247 thousand. 
In connection with the advance payments, ING Bank has issued a bank guarantee up to an 
amount of EUR 42 thousand total (2018: EUR 42 thousand). 
27.  Subsequent events 
A new type of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. This virus can cause a 
disease  known  as  COVID-19.  The  majority  of  patients  experience  fever  and  respiratory 
problems. The virus has emerged in many countries worldwide and measures have been 
implemented to stop its spread. The outbreak of the coronavirus and its spread in 2020 has 
affected financial markets across the globe. In March 2020 worldwide markets have fallen by 
double digit percentages due to a significant rise in uncertainty.  
The outlook of the financial markets is extraordinarily uncertain. The effect of the crisis and the 
economic recession that follows are expected to have a significant impact our client portfolio’s. 
The developments will result in lower fee income and profitability. Whether revenues and 
profitability will improve in the remainder of 2020 is dependent on the period during which the 
regions in which we operate are exposed to COVID-19 and the extent to which government 
measures may be prolonged, expanded or scaled down. Despite the extraordinarily uncertain 
times the Company is well positioned to deal with these challenging circumstances. 
The Company believes vigilance to be key in times of turbulent markets. We carefully keep track 
of market developments, investment fund transactions and quotes to ensure our clients receive 
valuations and reports that provide an accurate reflection of current market circumstances. This 
entails that we keep a close eye on markets’ reactions to policy changes by the central bank 
and market interventions by governments. We monitor indicators of market sentiment and 
adjust our portfolios accordingly to profit of opportunities when these may arise.  
The Company is part of the Aegon Asset Management Global organization that operates from a 
diverse set of locations in Europe, the United States and Asia. This allows us to be well positioned 
for and give assurance of continued operations during periods of local or regional disruption. 
The company has implemented a series of measures to minimize the impact of the coronavirus 
on our clients, including intensive monitoring of governance and operations and work-from-
home policies as part of business continuity plans.

The Events in early 2020 will give no new insights into the valuation of assets and liabilities of 
the Company as per 31 December 2019. The management board of the Company have adopted 
a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Relevant facts and circumstances 
relating to the financial position as per 31 December 2019 were assessed in order to reach our 
conclusion that there is no material uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going 
concern. The main area assessed was the COVID-19 impact on the Company’s business activities 
and financial performance. The Company has also assessed the impact of the financial markets 
on its revenues and concluded that the drop-in revenues does not jeopardize the viability of the 
company.

Emphasis of matter - uncertainty related to the effects of the 
coronavirus (COVID-19) 
We draw attention to note 27 in the financial statements in which the board of directors has described 
the possible impact and consequences of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on the company and the 
environment in which the company operates as well as the measures taken and planned to deal with 
these events or circumstances. This note also indicates that uncertainties remain and that currently it 
is not reasonably possible to estimate the future impact. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this 
matter. 
  
Report on the other information included in the annual report 
  
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains 
other information that consists of: 
•  Report of Directors; 
•  the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information: 
•  is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; 
•  contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit 
of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains 
material misstatements. 
By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such procedures was substantially less than the scope 
of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. 
The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the 
directors’ report and the other information in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil 
Code. 
  
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
  
Responsibilities of the board of directors 
The board of directors is responsible for: 
•  the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Part 9 of 
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and for 
•  such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting 
framework mentioned, the board of directors should prepare the financial statements using the going-
concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The board of directors should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. 
  
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain 
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we 
may not detect all material misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are 
considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the 
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. 
A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial statements 
2019 of Aegon Investment Management B.V. 
  
In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report, we have further set out in this appendix our 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves. 
The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout 
the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence 
requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following: 
•  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control. 
•  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. 
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors. 
•  Concluding on the appropriateness of the board of directors’ use of the going-concern basis of 
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report 
and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
