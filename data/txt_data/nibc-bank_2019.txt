By originating mortgages NIBC is able to serve two types of clients at the same time: retail 
clients and investors. When a mortgage loan-offer is made to the retail client, it is already 
determined whether the mortgage loan is on the balance sheet of the investor or NIBC. NIBC 
Direct is a lender of record and has the relationship with the retail client. For originate-to-
manage mortgages and own book mortgages the processes, services and underwriting criteria 
are uniform, so for a retail client the experience is identical. This results in alignment of interest 
between Investors and NIBC. At the same time the investor can choose a tailor-made mortgage 
portfolio that matches their appetite. In addition NIBC offers balance sheet support to optimise 
our tailor-made offering to investors. With experience in originating mortgages and managing 
risks of our own mortgage portfolio, NIBC has extensive knowledge which is shared with the 
investors. 
OTM adds value to our retail clients and our investors. For 
retail clients NIBC direct is able to offer a broad range of 
mortgage products with the full bandwidth of interest fixed 
periods due to the appetite of investors. For investors we 
offer the possibility to invest in Dutch mortgages with the

LETTER FROM THE CEO
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Dear reader,
Driven by our entrepreneurial culture, 2019 has proven to be another strong year for NIBC. On the
backdrop of increasing global uncertainty on both a geopolitical and macro-economic level, we
continued to rebalance and de-risk our portfolios, whilst remaining focused on growth and new
initiatives. Supported by our core values of being Professional, Entrepreneurial and Inventive, we again
are meeting all of our medium-term objectives, and continue to deliver upon our promises.
Our capital position remains strong, including the 30% increase in RWA's on our corporate loan
portfolios following the Internal Model Investigation (IMI) outcome in August of 2019. We continue to
be well positioned for Basel IV before mitigation actions. The solvency ratios at year end continue to
be comfortably above our SREP levels and provide us with sufficient buffers to comply with Basel IV
regulations, as also reflected by our leverage ratio of 7.1% at year-end 2019.
By meeting all our medium-term objectives with return on equity (ROE) of 11.4% and a strong
capital position shown by a CET1 ratio of 17.1%, and underpinned by the overall strong performance
over 2019, we propose a final dividend of EUR 0.53 per share, totalling to a full dividend for 2019 of
EUR 0.78 per share.
Looking at the world around us, 2019 has also been a year in which the banking industry continued
to face many challenges. With a low-for-longer interest environment now a reality, and negative
interest on retail savings slowly being introduced amongst European banks, the banking industry is
reshaping its form. As NIBC, we are able to react quickly to these outside challenges and adapt our
business proposition. And in that, we don’t shy away from making clear decisions. Recently we
announced the sharpened focus within our corporate client offering as well as the closing down of
our Markets business (fixed income, debt capital markets, equity capital markets). Further challenges
come from the regulatory side, ranging from capital related issues such as IMI to compliance related
issues such as SIRA, KYC and AML. NIBC is well in control and as our business model, as opposed to
universal banks, does not provide for current accounts, we are less vulnerable to these regulatory
issues. Nevertheless, the cost to comply and uncertainty as to future developments in regulatory
requirements is inevitably casting its shadow to the license to operate for banks in general.
NIBC benefitted from the Dutch economy that remained solid throughout the year. Nevertheless,
the uncertainty on a global level with Brexit becoming a reality at the end of January 2020, trade
wars glooming and the increasing effects related to the outbreak of the corona virus, the fears for a
turn of the economic cycle continue to grow. At the core of our strategy is our ability to re-balance
and reinvent our business. By continuously adapting to the changing environment, we have
significantly reduced corporate client exposures by more than EUR 750 million in 2019, mainly in the
more cyclical sectors like Energy, Leveraged Finance, and Shipping, whilst growing in more granular
portfolios, such as Receivables Finance and Leasing. In total, the corporate lending portfolio
decreased only by approximately EUR 150 million as we continue to prudently originate and follow
our clients through the cycle by supporting them in their growth ambitions.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 15
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Our ambition for growth thus remains unchanged, as we continue to expand our ‘originate-to-
manage’ activities both on the retail and corporate side of the business. Consequently, we
continuously create room for new initiatives that have higher margins and sufficient growth potential
in combination with scalability and supported by data driven technology. We are positive about the
partnerships with Fintechs in which we have invested, like iwoca, Finleap, and Ebury. In a broader
context, our equity positions again proved to be a natural balance against the low-for-longer
environment. Various revaluations as well as some favorable (potential) exits were again positive
drivers of our investment income. Last but not least, we signed a contract with OakNorth following
the pilot that ran last year, in which we use their platform for our client review process.
Although we are not a market share player and continue to aim for ‘margin over volume’, we clearly
see that our dual track strategy, originating for both our own balance sheet and for our Originate-M-
Manage (OTM) partners, has led to increased volumes in the retail client side, underpinning our
ability to originate in the current environment. Within the mortgage offering a new label LOT,
positioned as a mortgage with a particular focus on supporting sustainability, was recently introduced
to further accelerate our OTM offering.
Other proud initiatives include the recent launch of OIMIO, providing small commercial real estate
financing in the Netherlands and the first fully ESG-compliant CLO that we launched in the fourth
quarter.
Looking at the business volumes in 2019, origination continued to be strong on the retail client side,
with total origination of EUR 3.7 billion. Our mortgage portfolio for own book grew by
EUR 0.5 billion (+6%) to EUR 9.8 billion and the Originate-to-Manage (OTM) portfolio grew by
almost EUR 1.9 billion (+79%) to EUR 4.3 billion. Total OTM-mandates increased to almost
EUR 6.5 billion by securing additional contracts with new institutional investors, allowing us to offer
the entire suite of tenors to our clients as well as attract new clients. The Buy-to-Let market in the
Netherlands remains to develop favorably as reflected in an 12% increase of our portfolio to
EUR 0.7 billion in 2019.
On the corporate client side, despite significant reductions in some of the more cyclical sectors,
overall volume was relatively stable in 2019, highlighting our ability to rebalance, de-risk, reinvent and
steer our business. Origination margins are unfortunately still under pressure, and combined with the
focus on quality instead of quantity, overall margin of the book decreased slightly.
From a governance perspective, 2019 was also the year that Wim van den Goorbergh stepped down
as Chairman of the Supervisory Board to be succeeded by Dick Sluimers. I am grateful for Wim’s
leadership and thoughtful guidance and thank him for his contribution and support over the many
past years. At the EGM at the end of August 2019, Jeroen Kremers was appointed as a new Member
of the Supervisory Board.

LETTER FROM THE CEO
On 14 February 2020, our parent company NIBC Holding N.V. announced to be in discussions on a
possible cash offer by Blackstone. On 25 February they announced to have formally taken the next
step in signing the Merger Protocol, details of which can be found in the separate press release
available through our website. With Blackstone, NIBC will be equipped to even further improve on
its success and I look forward to drive long-term sustainable growth in this new chapter for NIBC.
I am proud that we are again delivering on our promises. Despite uncertainty and challenges in the
markets around us, I remain confident about our future and I look forward to engage with our
potential new shareholder Blackstone. Strengthened by our Think-Yes mentality, we are able to
continuously adapt ourselves to the demanding markets and increasing requirements. For that, I am
grateful to all our employees, for their never-failing commitment to be there for our clients at their
decisive moments, for their flexibility in these turbulent times, and their continued focus to build new
profitable growth well into the future.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS
NIBC has always been a speciality financier that has found ways to adapt to changing circumstances.
This capability to change is one of the core strengths of the bank. It is in the company’s DNA to
continuously explore new opportunities, develop new products and find new pockets of growth,
especially in underserved parts of the market. This is a capital strength in the uncertain, changing
environment that we see now, both at the global macro-economic and international level and,
specifically, in the banking industry.
The 2019 economic growth has weakened in north-western Europe while still displaying robust
fundamentals. In the Netherlands, economic growth remained solid and unemployment has
continued its downward trend. Growth in Germany, on the other hand, experienced a more
significant slowdown with the 2019 growth rate of 0.6%. Nonetheless, economic forecasts predict
that German growth should pick up in 2020 and return to a level closer to that of 2018 at 1.5%.
On a global level, overall risks persisted at a substantial level. Geopolitical tensions increased
compared to last year, affecting the volatility of financial markets. From the global macro-economic
perspective, negative surprises to economic activity in some emerging countries led to downward
adjustments of global growth forecasts; evidencing late-cycle tendencies. In the year to come, the
tensions are not expected to be subdued and late-cycle tendencies should become more tangible.
Consequently, growth in advanced economies, including the Euro area, is expected to remain
subdued, reflecting lowered external demand and a moderate pace of productivity growth. Besides,
the outbreak of the corona virus in China could have a negative impact on global growth, in 2020.
Given the global exposure of its economy, the Netherlands might suffer from this slowdown.
Conversely, the risk of a no-deal Brexit has been contained and some positive news regarding
commercial opposition between the United States and China somewhat limit the risk of escalation.
This offsets the increased risks linked to geopolitical tensions and the global macroeconomic situation.
Yet, we note that both factors continue to have elements of unpredictability that can lead to an
immediate increase of the risk at any given moment in time. With the balance of risks remaining
skewed to the downside, markets continue to be volatile and challenging in the year to come.
Beyond risks emanating from the global environment, the banking industry is currently faced with
specific challenges. The continued low-for-longer interest rates extend ahead and result in a liquidity
abundance in both capital and lending markets, leading to pressure on prices, and, in turn, on
profitability. At the same time, competition increases with regulatory developments leading to
lowered entry barriers (e.g. open access to customer financial data), the banking industry appears
bound to be remodelled not only by fintech start-ups becoming increasingly active, but also by the
big technology companies finding their way to the financial services sector. Consequently, the banking
ecosystem evolves at a swift pace, with the dissemination of online banking appetite and usage, even
in corporate banking. Concurrently, maintaining the licence to operate, with the continuous
development of regulatory standards and increasing capital requirements on the path to Basel IV,
bears higher costs and induces the need for acute choices. All the more so as regulatory pressure
continues to expand in the area of non-financial risk management. This specifically means increased
demands in fields such as client due diligence - mainly for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) policies, data privacy and transaction reporting. These demands require
continuous investments in the bank's processes, including IT. However, given that we do not provide
payment services either to retail customers or to corporate clients, the risks and the associated
efforts to mitigate these are lower for us than they might be for banks who do offer such payment
services.

VISION AND STRATEGY
About NIBC
NIBC was established in 1945 to finance the visionary entrepreneurs who helped rebuild the
Netherlands after World War II. Over time, we evolved to be an enterprising bank offering financing,
advisory and co-investing to our clients. Following the 2008 financial crisis, we reinvented ourselves,
focusing on being flexible and agile. We have reached many milestones since, with the launch of
NIBC Direct and the acquisition of Gallinat Bank AG in Germany. More recently, our steps into the
fintech space by acquiring minority stakes in Ebury, Finleap and OakNorth have been additional major
milestones. Together with institutional partners, we are expanding our Originate-to-Manage
proposition, optimising our position in the financial ecosystem.
Throughout our history, we have continued to build on our entrepreneurial DNA and have
continuously adapted to market circumstances and the needs of our clients, gradually shaping the
bank that we are today; best suited to help our clients at their decisive moments. Now and in the
future. We continue to build a sustainable franchise for the future, so we can continue to fulfil our
purpose.
Purpose and corporate values
Our purpose is to create a sustainable franchise for the future, so we can continue to make a
difference for our clients by focusing on their most decisive moments in business and in life.
As a bank built for entrepreneurs, we are committed to cultivate our ‘Think YES’ mentality by being
flexible and agile and by matching our clients’ can-do attitude. This enables us to address the
continously high requirements from the outside world (e.g. regulators). Our everyday decisions and
actions are guided by three corporate values, with which we aim to differentiate ourselves in the
market:
1. Professional: Our in-depth sector knowledge, expert financial solutions and tailored risk and
portfolio management are the foundation of our success.
2. Entrepreneurial: We are a sound and enterprising bank focused on decisive moments in our
clients’ business and in life. Our clients require a bank that can respond to their needs in an agile
way.
3. Inventive: We provide bespoke solutions and encourage our people to think creatively to meet
clients’ financial needs. Structuring is part of our DNA.
Our place in the financial ecosystem
NIBC is a medium-sized bank active in north-western Europe, more specifically in the Netherlands,
Germany, the UK, Belgium and the Nordics. We operate in this particular geographical area because
we know these markets and believe in their economic foundations. As a fully regulated bank we have
the professional mindset and capabilities that make us well positioned to partner with large financial
institutions, while also having the agility to cooperate with small and innovative fintechs. By exploring
both directions we continuously work on further positioning the bank. within the financial ecosystem.
Fintech start-ups are bringing innovative solutions to specific financial service products and often seek
cooperation with incumbent financial institutions because they lack the scale and regulatory expertise
to independently challenge the financial services industry. We recognise the impact financial
technology companies have on our industry and we are seeking cooperation with selected companies
as demonstrated by our partnerships to optimise our credit review process (e.g. OakNorth). This is
evidenced by our Originate-to-Manage mortgage product where we have a strategic partnership
with several large financial institutions.

We differentiate ourselves by setting a clear focus, both geographical and operational. We are active
in sectors and markets we know best, with products that can make a difference for our clients.
Our corporate client offering consists of the full range of products such as financial structuring,
collateralised lending, corporate lending, advisory, mezzanine and equity. Since 2019 the corporate
client segment is organised along a number of product market combinations, focused on origination,
execution and portfolio management of its core products based on specific client needs. We aim to
further rebalance activities and exposure, as we become more active in high growth areas acting as a
growth enabler for our clients. Our portfolios revolve around two main themes: Sustainability &
Transformation and Growth & Innovation. These two themes provide us with a strong basis to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 23
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
increase focus and fully utilise our core competence of developing solutions for complex financial
questions in specific underserved market segments, together with our clients.
In our retail offering we offer mortgages through intermediairies and operate a succesful deposit-
taking platform. The mortgages offering also includes products that serve clients in underserved
market segments such as Buy-to-Let and mortgages for self-employed clients. Our mortgage
products include an Originate-to-Manage (OTM) proposition in which we partner with institutional
investors such as AXA Investment Management. Through the various products, we are able to fully
utilise our existing agile and effective organisation, which includes making optimal use of third party
service providers who process mortgage loans. The Originate-to-Manage proposition within the
retail offering also supports increasing diversification of income and expanding our product offering to
institutional investors.
We continuously manage the composition of our funding by making use of a diverse range of funding
sources, including retail savings and wholesale funding. One of our strengths has always been a strong
capital position, providing flexibility to support further growth either organically or inorganically, or to
support shareholder returns.
NIBC is managed by an experienced team that has the professional, entrepreneurial and inventive
mindset that distinguishes NIBC in the financial ecosystem.
Medium-term objectives
With the execution of its strategy, NIBC aims to deliver on the following targets:
Medium-
term IFRS 9 IFRS 9 IAS 39

1 As from 2019, non-eligible profits attributable to the shareholders are no longer added to regulatory capital.
During 2019, S&P has upgraded NIBC’s credit rating to BBB+ with a stable outlook. The upgrade
reflects NIBC’s ability to preserve its robust capitalisation and successful progress to build up its loss-
absorbion capacity.
The way forward
Our long-term strategy translates into aiming to have the agility to continuously assess our portfolio
in order to ensure resilience and sustainable profitability. Especially in the late-cycle developments and
changing banking environment we aim to expand in a limited number of growth engines, while
focusing on initiatives that adhere to the following principles: display the potential of gaining a
meaningful market share in a specific niche; include the potential of digital and data driven scalability;
and be granular to allow for higher spreads and returns. The newly announced small CRE initiative
OIMIO in combination with the partnership with OakNorth allows us to provide real value to our
clients and help them in smaller lending market. These initiatives will add to the granularity of our
portfolio, which will enhance our risk profile in line with our risk appetite for smaller exposures.
Choosing to expand in a limited number of growth engines, in turn, translates into attrition in some
sectors or subsectors. In line with this strategy, we chose to discontinue our capital markets activities,
24 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
as announced on 15 January, 2020. After a close evaluation of our portfolio, we deemed these
activities not to be scalable enough due to rapidly changing regulatory environment and market
circumstances.
On the corporate client side the general strategy translates into a focus on increasing granularity in
our portfolio, developing new partnerships and expanding our Originate-to-Manage model to new
asset classes within the corporate client offering. Thus, in line with the strategy principles to embrace
technologically advanced partners within our ecosystem we aim at further expanding our
collaborations with fintechs.
In our retail client offering, we aim to increase the current Originate-to-Manage mandate and further
diversify the proposition. The Buy-to-Let portfolio is expected to grow beyond EUR 0.9 billion in the
next years. In the long term it is our goal to consistently achieve a total mortgage origination of
EUR 5 billion on a yearly basis (2019: EUR 3.7 billion). In 2020 we will therefore continue our effort
to further develop our proposition and product offering. As a first step in 2020 we have launched
'Lot' as a new mortgage label which will have its own mandate, starting with an external mandate of
EUR 1 billion, increasing our total mandate to EUR 7.5 billion as per publication date of the 2019
Annual Report.
Next to growing these businesses, we will continue the rebalancing of our exposures in selected
cyclical sectors. The Shipping, Leveraged Finance and Energy portfolios have already been significantly
reduced in the last two years and we are ahead of our guidance given at CMU. NIBC willl continue to
rebalance portfolios in the coming years and will incorporate any changes in circumstances as they
develop. For example the Shipping portfolio is expected to grow in 2020 after we have evaluated our
current exposures in Shipping and how that relates to both our risk appetite and strong capital
position. We have concluded that there is room for some growth in this specific client segment.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Overview
NIBC continues to deliver on its promises by reporting a strong result over 2019. On the back of this
performance, NIBC has been able to meet all of its medium-term objectives, including an upgrade of
its credit rating to BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s. In 2019, NIBC focused on the execution of its
rebalancing strategy, as announced during the Capital Markets Update at the end of 2018. This
strategy means an increased focus on those niches, in which NIBC can add value to its clients by
offering the right financial solutions at their decisive moments. It also implies a reduction of our
efforts in areas where it is not so clear that NIBC can play this decisive role, leading to reduced
exposures in selected portfolios. With these results, NIBC has ensured it is a well capitalised bank
with increasingly more granular exposures, enabling it to execute the selected strategy.
The following section provides an overview of the performance and main developments of 2019,
after which the 2019 financial performance and financial positions are discussed in detail, followed by
a review of the bank's solvency.

Profitability
Overal 2019 profitability, measured as return on equity, meets our medium term objective, as it
reached 10.2% (2018: 13.2%). The decrease in profitability is mainly related to the non-recurring
items. Excluding non-recurring items, profitability slightly increased to 10.6%. In absolute terms net
profit attributable to shareholders decreased in 2019 to EUR 190 million, compared to
EUR 229 million in 2018. Adjusted for non-recurring items, net profit attributable to shareholders
increased to EUR 197 million (2018: 181 million). Another factor influencing the return on equity is
the equity base, which increased by EUR 118 million at 1 January 2019 compared to 1 January 2018.
This has a negative impact on the 2019 ROE of 0.8%-point.

Main changes in 2019 affecting our financial results
In 2019, the corporate client offering focused on the rebalancing of its portfolio in line with NIBC's
strategy around two themes, Sustainability & Transformation and Growth & Innovation, as decribed in
the Vision & Strategy chapter. The rebalancing is reflected in the composition of our corporate
portfolio. As per 31 December 2019, the total corporate client exposure decreased by
EUR 0.5 billion in 2019 on the back of our rebalancing efforts. We have actively reduced our Energy
and Financial Sponsors & Leveraged Finance and Shipping portfolios, in line with the strategy
disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report.
Within the retail client offering, we have further increased our Originate-to-Manage (OTM) mandates
in 2019. This resulted in total mandates of EUR 6.5 billion at year-end. Alongside our partnership with
AXA we have also engaged with other institutional investors. Total mortgage loan origination
volumes reached a record level of EUR 3.7 billion, of which EUR 2.0 billion relates to the OTM
mandates. EUR 1.5 billion relates to owner-occupied of own book and EUR 0.2 billion Buy-to-Let
(BtL) for own book.
In 2019 NIBC has been notified by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) on the outcome of the internal
model investigation (IMI) as part of ongoing supervision by DNB. The IMI has resulted in 30%
additional RWAs for our corporate loan portfolios. This had a negative impact of -2.9%-point on our
CET 1 ratio at the time of the notification. As the composition and size of our portfolio changes the
effect will change. However, as per Q3 2019 we consider the additional RWA requirement to be
part of the regular prudential requirements and therefore will not calculate the effect separately for
each reporting date. Additionally, on 15 October 2019 DNB published a press release announcing
the intention to implement a minimum floor requirement on the risk weighting for the portfolio of
non-NHG residential mortgages under the IRB model. As a result of this measurement our pro-
forma CET 1 ratio per year-end 2019 would decrease with 1.8%-points to 16.9%. Due to our strong
capitalisation we are well positioned to absorb the impact of these regulatory changes without
affecting our ability to pay out dividend, in line with our dividend policy. Furthermore, this is in line
with the guidance given on the impact of Basel IV.
Financial Performance
In 2019 NIBC has shown strong results which is reflected in a return on equity which is in line with
our medium term objectives. Net interest income, excluding the IFRS 9 impact amounting to
approximately EUR 34 million in 2019, remained stable. On the other hand funding costs have slightly
decreased. Additionally we have managed to keep our cost/income ratio at a stable level despite
additional costs relating to strategic changes within the company, the transition to our IT oursourcing

partner and several regulatory projects relating to KYC, AML and other (non-) financial risk
requirements.
Operating income
In 2019 operating income decreased by EUR 26 million to EUR 524 million (2018: EUR 550 million)
including non-recurring items in 2018. Excluding non-recurring items operating income increased by
EUR 11 million (2018: EUR 513 million).
Net interest income
In 2019, net interest income decreased by EUR 15 million to EUR 417 million. NIBC further reduced
the effective funding spread from 0.73% to 0.71%. Net interest margin slightly decreased to 1.99%,
reflecting the diminishing IFRS 9 pull-to-par effect on net interest income. In 2019 the IFRS 9 related
pull-to-par effect decreased to EUR 34 million (from approximately EUR 50 million in 2018).
Excluding the IFRS 9 effect on net interest income, the net interest margin remained stable at 1.83%
(2018: 1.85%).

relates to the reclass of the loan to Beequip from corporate client assets to treasury. The net interest
income related to corporate bank activities decreased to EUR 185 million (2018: EUR 202 million).

Interest income for our retail client offering grew from EUR 130 million in 2018 to EUR 137 million in
2019. In our retail client offering the net volume of mortgage loans (including netting of savings values
and excluding fair value amounts) increased by EUR 520 million to a total of EUR 9.8 billion. The
margin on own book mortgages decreased from 2.36% to 2.30%, reflecting a decrease in the margin
on newly originated mortgage loans compared to those that are re- and prepaid. We continue to see
elevated levels of prepayment as a result of the current low interest rate environment and increased
competition in the Dutch mortgage market. As the bank focusses on originating the shorter tenors
for its own book, this also increases downward pressure on the portfolio spread. Originating shorter
tenor mortgages for our own book further contributed to the reduction of the spread on the
mortgage loan book. Furthermore, we have adjusted our appetite to originate more loan-to-value
mortgages at the lower end of the loan-to-value spectrum, as is also reflected in a lower average
Loan-to-Indexed-Market Value (LTIMV) as disclosed in note 55-25. This also contributes to a lower
spread as well as a better collateralised mortgage loan portfolio and lower expected credit losses on
a portfolio level.

Net fee and commission income
In 2019 Originate-to-Manage fees displayed strong growth in line with the continued growth of the
assets under management. On the other hand, due to the sale of a significant part of our fund
investments in 2018, corporate Originate-to-Manage fees decreased to EUR 7 million in 2019,
reflecting a fee at a normalised level going forward.
■ Fee income from the Originate-to-Manage mortgage offering increased from EUR 11 million in
2018 to EUR 15 million in 2019. During 2019, NIBC successfully increased the mandates from
institutional investment partners to a level of EUR 6.5 billion. Assets under management at year-
end 2019 are EUR 4.3 billion (2018: EUR 2.4 billion).
■ In line with our expectations Originate-to-Manage fees relating to corporate loans decreased in
2019 to EUR 7 million following the decrease of NIBC's fund management activities related to
NEIF.
■ M&A related fees declined in 2019 compared to 2018 by EUR 7 million, reflecting the
exceptionally high 2018 fees relating to a single transaction with significant fee income.
■ During 2019 lending related fee income has remained stable at EUR 10 million.
■ Fee income related to NIBC capital markets activities has been stable during 2019 at around
EUR 4 million. Following the discontinuation of our capital markets activities early 2020, brokerage
fees will no longer continue in 2020.

Investment income
In 2019 investment income remained at a relatively high level for the third consecutive year. Reflecting
the positive market circumstances for private equity investments. Positive developments in the equity
markets let to an increase of the equity portfolio by 41% to EUR 303 million at year-end 2019,
primarily driven by revaluations and several new investments.
The equity investment portfolio of EUR 303 million at year-end 2019 can be categorised in four types
of investments.
■ EUR 123 million relates to direct investments from transactions executed with corporate clients
which results in EUR 25 million of investment income in 2019;
■ EUR 109 million relates to investments in equity funds in which NIBC is general partner (GP), co-
founder, cornerstone investor or a combination of these roles. In 2019 investment income in these

■ EUR 54 million relates to NIBC's strategic investments in the fintech space. These investments

Other income
Other income, which includes various components, comes at EUR 7 million (2018: loss of
EUR 7 million). Below is a breakdown of these components.
■ Net trading income equals EUR 5 million (2018: loss of EUR 1 million).
■ Net gains or losses from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were EUR 1 million
(2018: loss of EUR 6 million). This result is mainly related to the results of NIBC’s hedging activities
as far as they are not fully offset by adjustments following the application of hedge accounting.
■ A loss of EUR 1 million (2018: loss of EUR 2 million) is reported under net gains or losses on
derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost following the sale of loans at a price
lower than the carrying value at the time of sale.
■ Other income of EUR 2 million remained stable compared to 2018.
Operating expenses
Total operating expenses are impacted by the continued investments we make in our organisation to
address increasing regulatory requirements relating to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) and the follow-up of the internal model investigation (IMI), as well as the transition
of our IT infastructure to Cegeka in 2019. Taking into account the duration of some of these projects,
project related costs will remain at an elevated level in the coming period.
On 15 January 2020, NIBC published a press release announcing the discontinuation of the capital
markets activities (e.g. Fixed Income, DCM and ECM). The provision related to the restructuring
amounts to EUR 9 million. The discontinuation of our capital markets activities is reflected in our
operating expenses. Personnel expenses include EUR 7 million one-off costs relating to severance
payments. Other operating costs include EUR 2 million, mainly related to software licenses and data
vendor contracts. Given the material impact of these items, the 2019 results are presented both
including and excluding these non-recurring costs.
Personnel expenses
In 2019, the number of FTEs increased, primarily caused by the increase of Fte's in retail and the
investment in internal change capacity. Mainly as a consequence of the growth in the number of
employees, personnel expenses increased by EUR 9 million. Personnel expenses include a
EUR 7 million in one-off costs relating to the discontinuation of NIBC’s capital markets activities. As
2018 also included one-off personnel costs, the development of personnel expenses excluding
non-recurring results shows a comparable pattern.

Other operating expenses
In 2019, other operating expenses decreased by EUR 4 million compared to 2018, partly due to a
decrease in costs related to the IT retransition which has been finalised in the second half year of
2019 and partly due to lower advisor costs 2018 including additional expenses related to the IPO
expenses. Excluding non-recurring items other operating expenses decreased to EUR 94 million
(2018: EUR 99 million).
The developments of income and expenses result in a cost/income ratio of 44%, within ithe range of
the medium-term objective of a cost/income ratio below 45%, despite additional costs for the exit of
capital market activities amounting to EUR 9 million. Excluding non-recurring items the cost/income
ratio is 42%.

Credit loss expenses
The credit loss expense in 2019 decreased to EUR 49 million (2018: EUR 54 million). The decrease is
primarily driven by lower credit loss expenses in the corporate loan portfolio, amounting to
EUR 53 million (2018: EUR 62 million). Although credit losses in the corporate loan portfolio are still
considered elevated, concentrated in the Leveraged Finance and Energy portfolios. The overall
development displays, on average, the stable credit quality of the performing corporate loan portfolio.
The mortgage portfolio has shown a strong credit performance on the back of a strong housing
market in the Netherlands and low unemployment rates. Based on these developments, probabilities
of default and loss given default levels have continued to decrease in 2019. Furthermore, we
observed lower arrears and higher cure rates in our mortgage loan portfolio. These elements
resulted in an ECL recovery for the mortgage portfolio amounting to EUR 4 million in 2019 (2018:
EUR 8 million).
For 2019, the absolute cost of risk is within our through-the-cycle guidance, i.e. within the range of
EUR 45 to 55 million. The relative cost of risk decreased to 0.64% compared to a 2018 level of
0.73%. This decrease is caused both by the decrease in credit loss expenses and by the increase in
RWAs, mainly due to the 30% regulatory add-on to our corporate loans following the internal model
investigation outcome.

Tax
Tax expense in 2019 amounts to EUR 44 million, implying an effective tax rate of 17.9%. This is
below the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%, primarily driven by investment income being tax exempt
under Dutch tax law.
In 2018 there was a significant impact related to the introduction of IFRS 9 leading to
EUR 256 million reduction of shareholder's equity. With respect to the tax treatment of this impact
NIBC will adopt the industry standard, which is currently reflected in the tax position. The agreement
with tax authorities has not yet been formalised and is expected to cover the period 2018-2021.
In 2019 German tax authorities completed a regular audit on the tax position of NIBC Bank
Deutschland AG as part of the four-year cycle. The primary focus in the audit was on transfer pricing
and has led to no material findings.
Profit attributable to non-controlling shareholders
Our AT1 instrument amounting to EUR 200 million with a 6% coupon and a 7 years non-call results
in an annual interest expense of EUR 12 million. Under IFRS, the AT1 instrument is classified as
equity. The interest paid on this AT1 instrument is accounted for as profit attributable to
non-controlling shareholders, but classified as interest expense for tax purposes. As of 2019, the
interest paid on the AT1 instrument is no longer eligible for tax deduction, following a change in tax
law.
Profit after tax attributable to the shareholder
NIBC’s profit after tax attributable to the shareholder of the company amounts to a total of
EUR 190 million, compared to EUR 229 million in 2018.
Dividend policy
The policy of NIBC Bank N.V. is to have a 100% dividend pay-out ratio to its unique shareholder,
NIBC Holding B.V..
Balance sheet
Throughout 2019 assets remained at a stable level, however the composition of the loan portfolio
changed in nature as a result of the continued rebalancing of our corporate loan portfolio. Our
balance sheet reflects the strategic choices to sharpen our focus on growing in granular portfolios
which are technologically enabled. As a result credit quality of our assets improved. Furthermore, in
2019, we continued to diversify our funding mix at a lower average spread.

Assets
Total assets increased to EUR 22.4 billion (2018: 21.7 billion), in which total client assets increased to
EUR 18.0 billion, up from 17.3 billion in 2018. During 2019 client assets increased by EUR 0.7 billion,
mainly due to an increase in the mortgage loan portfolio and equity investments.
In our corporate client offering, we further executed the rebalancing strategy announced in 2018,
within which we are de-risking our balance sheet and focus on growth engines within selected
portfolios. This is reflected in the assets with a reduction of EUR 0.4 billion in the Energy and
Financial Sponsors & Leveraged Finance portfolios, leading to a level of total corporate client
exposures at EUR 9.4 billion. The total volume of corporate loans origination in 2019 was impacted
by choices made not to pursue growth in several portfolios. At the same time, much effort has gone
into the resolve of KYC/CDD related projects, primarily executed by our own staff. This resulted in a
total origination of EUR 3.0 billion, which compares to EUR 3.6 billion of origination in 2018.
With regards to our retail client offering we continued building on our dual-track strategy of
originating mortgage loans for own book as well as originating mortgage loans for the Originate-to-
Manage proposition. In 2019, origination amounted to EUR 3.7 billion of mortgage loans (2018:
EUR 3.4 billion), of which EUR 2.0 billion (2018: EUR 1.8 billion) related to Originate-to-Manage
36 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
mandates and the remainder was originated for own book. This increase in origination results in total
mortgage loans under management of EUR 14.1 billion (2018: EUR 11.7 billion), of which
EUR 9.8 billion of own book mortgages. Buy-to-Let mortgage loans increased to EUR 0.7 billion from
EUR 0.6 billion in 2018.
Asset quality
In 2019 we managed to further reduce the expected loss on our performing portfolio. On our
corporate loan portfolio the expected loss decreased to 30 bps, down from 31 bps at year-end
2018. In the retail client offering the expected loss decreased as well by 2 bps to 7 bps at year-end
2019. Our total impaired exposure decreased from EUR 446 million to EUR 419 million at year-end
2019, mainly as a result of a reduction of impaired exposures in Energy and Leveraged Finance. 31%
of the total impaired exposures have been provisioned.
As of 1 January 2018 credit losses are recognised based on an expected credit loss model. Within
this model 3 stages are identified based on the credit quality of the asset. The following table shows
the ECL stage classification of our on-balance assets.

In line with our purpose, we supported our client Reggeborgh at a decisive moment by entering into
an agreement in the second half of 2019 to provide financing to the company for a bid on the
outstanding shares of VolkerWessels. This commitment has led to the increase of the top-20
exposure / CET 1 ratio. Given the short tenor of the financing, this increase will be short-lived.
Funding and liquidity
We actively manage the composition of our funding profile and further enhanced the diversification
of our funding instruments, especially by the issuance of EUR 300 million senior non-preferred debt
to comply with the amounts needed for our MREL target.
■ The volume of retail savings increased by more than 6% to EUR 9.5 billion. The mix within retail
funding between on demand and term deposits has been managed towards more on demand
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 37
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
savings. At the end of 2019 64% of the retail savings consisted of on demand deposits, compared
to 61% at the end of 2018.
■ In the wholesale funding market we raised approximately EUR 2.2 billion in 2019, the most
notable transactions include:
■ in March 2019, a EUR 500 million 8-year public covered bond was issued;
■ in April 2019, a EUR 300 million 5-year public senior non-preferred (unsecured) bond was
issued;
■ in July 2019, a EUR 500 million 6-year public senior preferred (unsecured) bond was issued;
■ in October 2019, a EUR 500 million 10-year public covered bond was issued.
■ In addition, EUR 375 million senior (preferred) funding was privately placed in different formats,
with various maturities and in various currencies.
■ Institutional deposits under the German einlagensicherungsfonds (ESF) guarantee scheme
decreased to EUR 1.2 billion.
Active management of NIBC's funding profile, making use of the available instruments, combined with
the S&P upgrade to BBB+ following the senior non-preferred issuance and the positive developments
in the wholesale market in general have led to a further decrease in the average funding spread. The
funding spread above base decreased by 2 basis points to 0.71% in 2019 compared to 2018

Solvency
In 2019 the development of our capital ratios was characterised by regulatory changes, resulting in a
30% RWA add-on for the corporate loan portfolio as of 8 August, 2019 and the announcement of a
capital floor in the mortgage portfolio effective as per late 2020. Our best estimates indicate that
based on the current interpretations, the impact will be approximately 1.8%-point on CET 1 ratio.
More importantly, the impact is in line with the guidance given on Basel IV impact on the retail
portfolio. As we are well capitalised, we are able to absorb all these developments.
CET 1 development
In 2019 the CET 1 ratio decreased by 1.9%-point to 18.7%. Resulting from the internal model
investigation (IMI) findings, Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs) for the corporate loan portfolio has
increased with 30%, resulting in a CET 1 ratio decrease of 2.9%-point. NIBC actively rebalanced the
corporate loan portfolio, resulting in a total RWA decrease of EUR 320 million, which has a positive
impact of 0.6%-point.

Internal Model Investigation
As disclosed in a press release on 26 June 2019, NIBC has been notified by De Nederlandsche Bank
(DNB) on the final outcome of an internal model investigation (IMI) as part of ongoing supervision by
DNB. The IMI, which was performed on the basis of the European central bank (ECB) Targeted
Review of Internal Models (TRIM) framework, has resulted in 30% additional RWAs for our corporate
loan portfolios for which internal models are used, resulting in a 2.9%-point decrease of our CET 1
ratio upon implementation of the add-on.
The IMI has also resulted in observations related to our internal model and data quality governance.
In order to resolve these observations, NIBC has drafted a remediation plan which it is currently
executing.
Capital treatment of (interim) profits
To align with regulatory treatment of (interim) profits, NIBC has adjusted the reported solvency
ratios with effect from 2019. They continue to be based on the full implementation of CRR (fully
loaded), but no longer include (interim) profits for which the company has not yet received approval
to add to eligible capital. Profits are added to regulatory capital after attribution to retained earnings
or after NIBC has received the required approval to add interim results to regulatory capital. As from
2019, the reported ratios have been adjusted accordingly. This adjustment has no implications for
NIBC's dividend policy. With a 100% dividend pay-out ratio this also does not have any impact on
NIBC Bank's capital ratio's.

SREP requirements
Our solvency levels are well above the minimum required levels as set by DNB in the SREP. The
maximum distributable amount (MDA) is determined by comparing actual solvency levels to the
minimum SREP requirements. Solvency ratios have to exceed the SREP requirements to allow
distribution of dividends. To prevent limitations in distributions, the MDA which consists of the
amount of CET 1 above the SREP requirement divided by the combined buffers (CCB and CCyB),
must be above 100%. The present ratios provide sufficient room to execute NIBC's dividend policy.
Various jurisdictions relevant to NIBC have introduced or increased a Countercyclical Capital Buffer
ratio (CCyB) requirement through 2019, resulting in a requirement of 0.2% on 1 January 2020
(2019 : 0,1%). The CCyB of 1% in the UK is the main driver of this requirement.

Our unweighted solvency position calculated by the leverage ratio equals 7.8%, comfortably above
the minimum requirements and in line with 2018 (7.9%).
Basel IV
An agreement was reached on the finalisation of the Basel III reforms ("Basel IV") in December 2017.
While certain elements still require more clarification, based on our current assessment and
interpretation of the Basel IV Standards, we expect the impact to be in a range of 15%–25% of
RWAs by 2027, compared to the RWAs as determined per the end of 2019.
The estimated Basel IV impact is lower than previous estimations as the current reported RWAs
already include the impact of the IMI-related measures. The IMI impact can be viewed as a material
step towards Basel IV. This is based on the assumption that NIBC will successfully implement the
required improvements in its model landscape. This does not take into account possible management
actions, nor potential changes to Pillar 2 requirements. This also assumes the current portfolio to be
the same in 2027, as well as RWAs based on the current economic environment.
On 15 October 2019 DNB published a press release announcing the intention to implement a
minimum floor requirement on the risk weighting for the portfolio of non-NHG residential
mortgages under the IRB model. DNB assessed that systemic risk increased due to the continued rise
in house prices, resulting in signs of overvaluation. DNB intents to implement the minimum floor in
the autumn of 2020 for a two-year period. The pro-forma impact of the minimum floor on the CET
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 41
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
1 ratio as per year-end 2019 is a decrease of 1.8%-points, consequently reducing the remaining
expected RWA impact of Basel IV to 10% - 15%.
An uncertainty for banks is that the Basel IV Standards will have to be incorporated into legislation
within the European Union. The EU legislative process may take up to several years. During this
process of transposition in EU and national law, adjustments may be implemented. We aim to meet
the final requirements early in the phase-in period while we continue to execute our client-focused
strategy.
Resolution
Under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), resolution authorities are required to
assess whether – in case of a bank's failure – the resolution objectives are best achieved by winding
down the bank under normal insolvency proceedings or resolving it. If it is the latter, a preferred
resolution strategy is developed, including the use of appropriate resolution tools and powers as
described in the BRRD.
For NIBC, the relevant resolution authority has stated the preferred resolution strategy to be single
point of entry at NIBC Bank level with the following approach: “The use of the sale of business tool
(SOB), the share-deal version, is considered the preferred approach for a resolution of NIBC Bank. Following
the write down and conversion of capital instruments, this could be used in combination with a bail-in
depending on the level of losses in resolution. The use of the bail-in tool is considered as a variant strategy”.
In line with the preferred resolution strategy, a non-binding MREL requirement has been
communicated to NIBC. The MREL requirement has been established to ensure that banks in the
European Union have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities to absorb losses in the case of a
potential bank failure. This indicative non-binding MREL requirement is in line with our expectations,
and consistent with our funding and capital plans.
With the sucessful senior non-preferred bond issuance of EUR 300 million in April 2019, we have
taken a major step towards our MREL requirement. We observe that after Brexit and without
additional measures taken by the EU, some of NIBC's Tier 2 instruments, issued under UK regulation,
may no longer comply. We also note that the legal regime will change in December 2020 and that
regulatory clarifications may still follow after this date. In this context, NIBC remains confident it will
be able to meet the MREL requirement.
Following the execution of the merger of the NIBC Bank Deutschland AG with NIBC Bank NV (refer
to Recent developments) regulatory supervision of NIBC on resolution will be transfered from the
SRB to the NRA department within DNB. The reason is that NIBC will no longer be a 'cross border
group'. As of now we do not know whether or to what extent this change may lead to a different
view on, or an adjustment to, the indicative non-binding MREL-requirement.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Corporate client offering
Our corporate client offering consists of providing our clients senior debt, mezzanine and equity
financing, advisory and some capital markets products. With this offering, we focus on serving
medium-sized clients in selected sectors in north-western Europe with the purpose to enable them
to achieve their goals. We distinguish ourselves with tailor-made financing solutions and the ability to
execute transactions swiftly at the decisive moments for our clients. Since 2019 the corporate client
segment is organised around two themes Sustainability & Transformation and Growth & Innovation,
focused on origination, execution and portfolio management of its core products and specific client
needs. Clients are served from our offices in The Hague, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London.
As decribed in our Vision and Strategy paragraph we are facing several challenges. These can be
summarised as the 'low-for-longer' interest environment, (adverse) late-cycle trends, and increasing
requirements to retain our licence to operate. In order to address these challenges, we focus on our
long-term strategy as a speciality financier, favouring margin over volume, and being agile to adapt to
changing circumstances. In practice, this means we need to focus on initiatives that have sufficient
growth potential in combination with scalability, supported by data driven technology. In the
execution of our strategy, we incorporate key themes relevant to our clients, society and our business
model. From an external perspective these themes include technological advancements, innovation,
platformisation, the energy transformation, sustainability, consumer empowerment and ageing. As
drivers of future performance we will focus on further rebalancing selected activities and
corresponding exposures, income diversification, digital transformation, and continued customer
centricity towards corporate clients, SMEs and institutional investors.
In response to the 'low-for-longer' interest environment, we continued to actively manage our equity
investments, indirect client transactions, portfolios as well as focusing on fintechs. Our selection
process includes an evaluation of the ability to include these fintech companies in an environment in
which we can learn from each other by acquiring best practices and enhance growth using new
technologies and insights. Current revaluations of several equity investments show that we have been
successful in carefully selecting these partners.
In 2019 we have further solidified our partnership with OakNorth by entering into a 5-year contract
with the next generation credit platform, that will enable NIBC to incorporate most of its corporate
loan portfolio onto the platform. These partnership is focused on the underserved market segment
of small/medium-sized business lending. It is a scalable, technology enabled, growth initiative.
Early 2020 we have developed a new small Commercial Real Estate (CRE) initiative called OIMIO that
will provide CRE loans in the range of EUR 1 million to EUR 10 million in the Dutch market. We
acknowledged that this market is predominantly served by a small number of financing parties, who
are heavily exposed in this segment and as a result are reducing their exposures. The Dutch real
estate market is part of the core expertise of NIBC and the smaller loan segment is complementary
to our existing product offering. Together with our partner OakNorth and by applying enhanced
efficiencies in the small CRE lending process, we aim to offer a new standard in customer relationship
and experience, where we put client experience first and make technology a driving supporting
factor.
In order to be successful in all these initiatives, we need to focus on opportunities with sufficient
client demand and scalability potential. Not all of the required volume has to be on the bank's

balance sheet. By extending the Originate-to-Manage model to asset classes within the corporate
client offering we enhance volume potential and increase our fee income potential. In 2019 we closed
our first mandate with an institutional investor in a new Originate-to-Manage asset class proposition.
Going forward we aim to expand this mandate and our partner base amongst other institutional
investors.
We have evaluated our current propositions against criteria deemed imperative for succes in the
future: growth potential in combination with technology enabled scalability. We dedicate the
resources needed to make the new initiatives successfull, knowing that the first years are always a
period of investments. In turn, we choose to reduce our involvement is other activities. As a
consequence we have decided to discontinue our capital markets activities as communicated in the
press release dated 15 January 2020. Capital markets activities have been transformed significantly in
recent years, however the capital markets business has proven to be insufficiently scalable within
NIBC's business model. This activity requires a larger scale given the regulatory and investments in IT
necessary. Taking into account the focus on initiatives that are scalable from a growth perspective and
technology enabled it has been decided to discontinue the capital markets proposition, amongst
others the Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital Markets and Fixed Income activities. We will continue
to refine our focus and make further adjustments to our propositions if necessary in order to
continuously pursue underserved markets in which smaller tickets sizes are attainable and associated
higher spreads achievable, in line with our risk appetite.
In 2019 many of our colleagues as well as our clients have made it possible to successfully address the
Know Your Customer (KYC) and systemic integrity risk analysis (SIRA) findings from the regulator. We
are grateful for the commitment of both our staff and clients in their respective roles during these
processes, which ws instrumental to address these relatively swift. We recognise that this process has
required efforts from our clients during the past year and that it may have lowered their client
experience with NIBC. Consequently, our corporate lending NPS score has gone down to 47%from
63% in 2018. Now that the process has been completed we are focusing on the core of our business:
helping our clients with solutions to complex financial questions at their decisive moments.
Corporate portfolios
The portfolios revolve around two main themes, Sustainability & Transformation and Growth &
Innovation. These themes provide us with a strong basis to increase focus and fully utilise our core
competence of finding bespoke solutions for complex financial questions in specific underserved
markets.
Sustainability and Transformation
These teams focus on more traditional parts of the market, Mid Market Corporates, Shipping, Energy,
Commercial Real Estate and Infrastructure. Within Commercial Real Estate (CRE) we shifted from
large single client exposures towards e.g. more short-term development financing, resulting in an
increasingly diversified portfolio. Our next step in this perspective is to develop our small
Commercial Real Estate initiative OIMO, as discussed above. Within our Infrastructure portfolio we
used to finance traditional infrastructure objects with long maturities. While we continue to serve our
clients and help them throughout their business cycle, we are shifting towards digital infrastructure
projects such as financing data centres and glass fibre networks, with relatively shorter tenors
compared to the traditional infrastructure portfolio. The Energy and the Shipping portfolios have
been actively managed in 2019, with a focus strong on de-risking the exposures in those portfolios.
With our corporate lending product we focus on mid-market companies predominantly active in the
sectors Food & Agri and Manufacturing in the Netherlands and Germany. We offer solutions to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 47
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
enable our clients’ growth and development, which often evolve around a decisive moment. The low-
for-longer interest environment and increased competition lead to continued pressure on margins,
limiting the ability to differentiate ourselves. Therefore, we pro-actively adjust our commercial
strategies and focus depending on these market circumstances.
Growth and Innovation
Within this theme the focus is on Fintech & Structured Finance, Financial Sponsors & Leveraged
Finance, Mezzanine & Equity and Corporate Finance & Capital Markets. NIBC’s Fintech & Structured
Finance team supports financial technology companies through structured finance solutions,
corporate loans and a combination of debt & equity advisory and mergers & acquisitions advisory
services. The team also finances financial institutions such as leasing companies. In the fintech sector,
we also see opportunities to help our clients with our receivables financing solutions, at times
enhanced with minority equity stakes. We seek mutually beneficial relationships where we benefit
from the technological knowledge of our fintech client while we provide our financial knowledge and
solutions. In 2019 the team has successfully increased the portfolio to EUR 1.3 billion (2018:
EUR 1.0 billion) showcasing our ability to increase our presence in this highly competitive growth
market.
The Financial Sponsors & Leveraged Finance offering provides solutions for all stages of a
management buy-out, generating investment opportunities, innovative ideas and financing solutions to
enable growth for our financial sponsor and portfolio company clients. In 2019 we continued to
rebalance and de-risk the Financial Sponsors & Leveraged Finance portfolio. The ability to execute
this decision is reflected in the orderly decrease of the portfolio from EUR 1.6 billion as at year-end
2017 to EUR 1.0 billion at year-end 2019 (2018: EUR 1.3 billion). Within the Leveraged Finance
portfolio we continue to observe a relatively high level of impairments.
In our Mezzanine & Equity Solutions we focus on growth and succession financing, providing
subordinated debt and minority equity solutions. Often this goes hand-in-hand with senior financing
solutions, such that we provide a total solution. Also for these products, we are looking for granular
direct investments and lending solutions rather than large investments in investment funds.
For more than 15 years, collateralised loan obligation funds (CLO) have been part of our product
offering. 2019 has marked the launch of North Westerly VI, the first CLO that is fully compliant with
explicitly defined environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. The ESG criteria prevent the
fund from investing in controversial sectors such as coal power and mining, extreme fossil fuels,
weapons and firearms, tobacco, gambling, amongst others. Transparency is provided through detailed
investor reports and analysis, which includes reporting the portfolio composition from an ESG criteria
perspective on a quarterly basis. NIBC is proud to be the first bank to issue such a fully ESG
compliant CLO as illustrated by our continued committment to develop innovative sustainable
banking products. The CLO settled on 8 January 2020 with a notional of EUR 410 million.

On the back of rebalancing several portfolios, both increasing and decreasing exposures, net interest
income was strong in 2019 and in line with prior year net interest income. Despite challenging
circumstances related to the low interest environment and liquidity abundance leading to additional
pressure on interest margins we have been able to keep net interest income relatively stable.
Investment income of this seasoned portfolio was EUR 60 million (2018: EUR 74 million). The result
is primarily related to positive revaluations of investments and related to realised results
(EUR 16 million). In 2018 we observed the successful exits from investment in funds NEIF and MBF
IB, leading to realised results of EUR 32 million and EUR 15 million respectively. The result of the
investment portfolio reflects the positive climate for private equity on the back of the low interest
environment..
Credit loss expenses are impacted by stage 3 credit losses mainly related to exposures in cyclical
sectors, which confirms our strategy to de-risk these portfolios. We will continue to evaluate the risk
profile of our portfolios against our risk appetite. Despite our de-risking efforts, we do not expect
cost-of-risk levels to materially decrease on short-notice.
Total corporate loan origination in 2019 amounted to EUR 3.0 billion, compared to EUR 3.7 billion in
2018. As prepayments remain at an elevated level, close to our total origination, the corporate loan
book decreased from EUR 9.0 billion to EUR 8.9 billion. The equity investment portfolio increased to
EUR 303 million (2018: EUR 215 million), EUR 53 million is the result of investments and
EUR 63 million is related to positive revaluation adjustments and distributions. These increases were
off-set by EUR 32 million in divestments, of which EUR 27 million related to fund investments. The
loan facility to Beequip is no longer part of the corporate client assets, but was transfered to Treasury
on 1 January 2019. As a result total corporate client assets decreased to EUR 9.4 billion (2018:
EUR 9.9 billion).
Retail client offering
NIBC offers mortgage loans, Buy-to-Let mortgage loans and saving products to its retail clients. With
transparent pricing and conditions, these products help our clients executing or preparing for their
decisive moments. We do not provide general banking services such as payment solutions or current

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
accounts, allowing us to focus on products with which we can stand out. Retail client offering is active
in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.
The retail client offering is also facing the challenges as discussed in Vision and Strategy. This can be
summarised as the low-for-longer interest environment, (adverse) late-cycle trends and increasing
requirements to comply with our licence to operate. In order to address those challenges we need
to focus on initiatives that have sufficient growth potential in combination with scalability, supported
by data driven technology.
In February 2020, NIBC has introduced a new mortgage label 'Lot Hypotheken', which is set up
specifically to further expand our Originate-to-Manage mortgage proposition. This way NIBC
increases its ability to serve a broader range of clients, intermediaries and institutional investors. Lot
Hypotheken supports sustainability, offers competitive interest rates and aims to outperform on
processes. Lot Hypotheken will start originating NHG mortgages. On top Lot Hypotheken offers an
attractive sustainability loan part for retail clients to realise energy savings measures. This new label
will be positioned independently from our NIBC Direct mortgages label and will operate under the
licence of NIBC Bank N.V. This new initiative fits our ambition to diversify our income and to grow
our asset portfolio which will generate additional fees.
Mortgages
NIBC only offers mortgage loans in the Netherlands. NIBC Direct mortgage loans are offered via
independent intermediaries throughout the Netherlands. The mortgage servicing and back office
activities are outsourced to a third party. With this operational set-up of our mortgage business, we
have created an efficient and scalable business process. We continuously reflect on developments and
the options that our operational set-up provides. With NIBC Direct we created a one-stop-shop for
intermediaries by supplying a full product range from niche products to price competitive long-term
interest rates mortgage loans. For clients of NIBC Vastgoed hypotheek (Buy-to-Let) we increased our
service level by offering the possibility to do business directly.
Our multi-track mortgage loans strategy has continued to be successful, originating mortgage loans
for own balance sheet and for third-party (institutional) investors. As a result, our mortgage
origination volumes further increased. In total, origination volumes have increased to EUR 3.7 billion
in 2019 (2018: EUR 3.4 billion). EUR 2.0 billion of the originated mortgage loans are originated for
the Originate-to-Manage proposition.
We consider it imperative that customers with an interest-only mortgages are aware of the
characteristics of their mortgage loan. Since the start of 2019, we approached specific segments of
our clients and offered them a personal interview to talk about their personal financial situation.
NIBC believes it is essential that a mortgage loan remains affordable in the future and that residual
debts are prevented where possible and therefore we actively participate in the sector-wide initiative
'Aflossingsblij'. Active mortgage loan servicing is and will remain an important part of our service to
customers.
Mortgages for own book
The Dutch housing market price index continues to increase leading to further improvement of the
credit quality of the mortgage portfolio. This has resulted in a decrease of the arrears amount to
EUR 11 million (2018: EUR 19 million). With a continued low interest rate environment also the
number of mortgages renewals has remained high. We continued to focus on the more profitable
segments of the mortgage market, outside of the NHG market and within niches like self-employed,
expats and Buy-to-Let. Market circumstances continue to be competitive, however are more focused
50 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
on service rather than price sensitivity in this segment. As a result in 2019 we have invested in
improving our onboarding processes. This has increased the ease and speed of doing business with
NIBC Direct. The volume of owner-occupied mortgage loans recognised on the balance sheet of
NIBC increased to EUR 9.1 billion in 2019 (2018: EUR 8.6 billion). In 2019, origination for own book
amounted to EUR 1.5 billion (2018: EUR 1.6 billion) and re- and prepayments were stable at
EUR 1.1 billion (2018: EUR 1.1 billion). Origination for Buy-to-Let increased to EUR 0.2 billion,
leading to a total portfolio of EUR 0.7 billion as at year-end 2019.

Originate-to-Manage mortgages
Together with our institutional partners, we have successfully grown the OTM mortgage propostion.
There are a number of unique selling points for our Originate-to-Manage proposition. The mortgage
loans we originate for OTM carry the NIBC Direct brand, the client has a contractual relationship
with NIBC and the OTM mortgage follows exactly the same (application) process as mortgage loans
for own book. Furthermore, the institutional investor has flexibility in determining what type of
mortgage exposures are included in its portfolio. The investor can for example choose the length of
the fixed interest term on the mortgages and whether or not the mortgage is covered by the Dutch
mortgage guarantee scheme (NHG). Next to this, NIBC can offer balance sheet support. The
institutional investors usually favour long duration mortgage loans. There are, however, cases where
the client needs short-term bridge financing. NIBC, with its balance sheet, can offer bridge financing
to the client, while the mortgage is transferred to our partner as soon as the loan is originated.
Further, the experience of NIBC in mortgage origination and in managing mortgage loan portfolios
allows us to successfully execute our role as a strategic partner to institutional investors.
An essential element of the OTM product is that NIBC has transferred all economic risks related to
the OTM mortgage loans. The loans are immediately sold to the strategic partner once a loan offer is
accepted by a client and distributed. Therefore, the OTM product does not result in on-balance
positions and consequently does not lead to additional credit risk. NIBC’s income on the OTM
mortgage activity comes from the fees it receives for services provided to the investors.
In the OTM offering, we have several strategic partnerships, with whom we currently have a total
mandate to originate a portfolio of EUR 6.5 billion mortgage loans. At year-end 2019, the total
portfolio amounted to EUR 4.3 billion (2018: EUR 2.4 billion). As discussed above, NIBC has
launched the new label 'Lot Hypotheken' to further build its Originate-to-Manage (OTM) franchise,
leading to an increase of our OTM mandates by EUR 1 billion.

Savings
The retail savings products are an important pillar in the funding strategy of NIBC. NIBC’s savings
products are offered exclusively via our online channel in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.
Active management of in- and outflow of deposits resulted in an increase of the total retail savings
deposits in 2019 to EUR 9.5 billion (2018: EUR 8.9 billion), which fits within the bank’s funding
appetite. Within the savings portfolio, the share of on-demand deposits increased from 61% in 2018
to 64% in 2019. We continue to evaluate our funding mix as a whole and possibilities to further
develop and employ the retail savings offer within NIBC’s funding mix.
Performance
Profit after tax for the retail client offering slightly improved compared to 2018, benefitting from
increasing fee income from the OTM offering and increased net interest income.

The total mortgage loan book increased to EUR 9.8 billion as a result of EUR 1.7 billion of origination
for own book in 2019. Despite a year-on-year increase in origination spreads for both Buy-to-Let and
owner occupied mortgage loans the spread on the mortgage loans portfolio decreased by 6 basis
points to 2.30%. The decrease of the portfolio spread was caused by an increased share in origination
of short-term fixed rate mortgages, and lower loan-to-value (LtV) levels on our mortgage portfolio.
Further, we observed increased competition in the mortgage market, creating downward pressure on
mortgage rates.
Net fee and commission income for the retail client offering fully reflects income from the Originate-
to-Manage business. The OTM proposition is one of the growth drivers in the income statement. As
both the amount of origination and the total originated portfolio increased substantially, fee income
from this product increased by 36%.
Regulatory charges include the annual levy related to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS). In 2019,
our increasing market share in new deposits increased the levy increased to EUR 10 million (2018:
EUR 9 million).
52 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The improved state of the Dutch housing market resulted in lower LtVs on mortgage loans, and
consequently reduced risks in our mortgage book. On the back of the quality profile improvement,
credit loss recoveries in 2019 amounted to EUR 4 million. At year end the total impairment balance
amounts to EUR 3 million (2018: EUR 7million)1.
Treasury & Group functions
The net interest income impact from the pull-to-par effect related to IFRS 9 is attributed to Treasury
& Group functions. Total net interest income from this IFRS 9 related effect amounts to
approximately EUR 34 million (2018: approximately EUR 50 million). The effective funding spread
marginally decreased from 0.73% to 0.71% in 2019, leading to an increase of net interest income.
The annual resolution levy of EUR 4.6 million in line with previous periods.
In 2018 the EUR 17 million tax benefit related to tax losses carried forward from losses in 2010 and
2011 was recognised in this segment. In 2019 a tax benefit amounting to EUR 4 million was
recognised in the income statement as a result of the revaluation of the Dutch deferred tax asset,
following the adjustment of the future corporate income tax rate, enacted in the second half of 2019.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management has an integral role in facilitating NIBC’s desired growth strategy while carefully
managing and monitoring risks in an structured and efficient manner. In the corporate offering,
intense contact with origination and portfolio management as well as in-depth portfolio and client
knowledge assist in safeguarding the portfolio. In the retail offering, risk is managed through simple
and transparent products and an experienced arrears management team aimed at preventing
foreclosures. We mainly pursue credit and investment risk; lowering our interest rate, currency,
liquidity and operational risks while ensuring solid capital and liquidity positions. These are integral
aspects of the corporate and retail platform. Our risk appetite defines the scope and boundaries we
are comfortable with, while our risk management framework provides us with a structured approach
for managing the various risks on a daily basis. It is indispensable that sound risk management is
rooted in our culture, as it is the responsibility of all our people to service our clients over the long
term in the way that they expect us to do, and in relationships based on trust, transparency and
reliability.
The origination philosophy is centred around the client relationship, understanding the client's cash
flow and the availability of collateral. In our corporate client offering we apply an integrated approach
to managing credit risk by focusing on risk-adjusted returns. We assess whether a new opportunity
fits our risk appetite, and evaluate commercial and compliance matters prior to engaging with any
particular client. In this process we consider credit risk and financial market risk as part of the
decision process and conduct risk assessments prior to making the final lending decision. The ultimate
decision is dependent on our comfort with the specific client. The Restructuring & Distressed Assets
(RDA) department is highly experienced, and typically engaged at an early stage of client financial
distress to maximise the probability of a successful work-out and to limit potential losses. In our retail
client offering we apply a conservative approach to new products and use programme lending for
regular mortgage loans. In addition, sophisticated tools are used to model credit risk, such as
internally developed methodologies under the advanced internal rating-based (AIRB) approach.
Our business actively supports mid-sized corporates and new ventures at their decisive moments. For
retail clients we also aim to support them at their decisive moments, e.g. when buying a house. To be
successful, it is vital that we have the room to be inventive in our approach. Hence it is the nature of
our business to investigate alternative solutions and facilitate exceptions to the standard in order to
service our clients efficiently. To manage the risks associated to this approach, we benchmark all
potential transactions against our risk appetite .
NIBC has the advantage of its medium scale and the close proximity and collaboration there is
between colleagues and the close interaction with its client base. This provides a setting in which a
quick and efficient multidisciplinary approach can be taken in areas of risk management. We therefore
have the capacity to keep moving forward as a business while we continue to comply with evolving
regulatory requirements.
Developments in risk management
Despite a declining economic climate with lower GDP growth expectations and global uncertainties
stemming from geopolitical and economic tensions, NIBC continued to improve its risk controls while
facilitating desired growth including new business ventures. Overall performance is ahead of
expectations where we remain well within our risk appetite with more than sufficient buffers
(e.g. capital and liquidity) in place. Under NIBC’s stress testing framework capital ratios remain
adequate.
56 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Within the financial industry we continue to observe the risks in the Leveraged Finance and Energy
markets where NIBC has successfully reduced both portfolios ahead of targets. We remain aware of
our position in the market and take a careful approach to areas where we see increased levels of risk
while we continue to spot new opportunities in terms of products and markets. The deliberate
decrease in certain areas is absorbed by growth in other higher margin segments and the portfolio
continues to develop in the targeted direction.
Throughout 2019 we have continued to manage the asset quality of our lending book and an
important aspect is the rebalancing of our portfolios, aimed at higher granularity of exposures and
smaller portfolios in certain sectors and products. Although impairments are still at an elevated level,
driven by credit losses on a small number of individual clients within Leveraged Finance, and Energy
we see the first effects in the underlying portfolios with lower overall non-performing exposures.
The fintech landscape has an increasingly important role in the economy where NIBC continues to
grow in this area with both financing granular portfolios of receivables and making strategic
investments in promising fintechs (e.g. Ebury, Iwoca, OakNorth) based on a standard set of criteria. A
skilled second line of defence adds value in the transaction process where risks are sufficiently
observed and addressed accordingly.
Risk Management had an active role in growing business areas such as Originate-to-Manage, where
the balance between risk/return remains an important theme. Risk management is involved early in
discussions on transactions and markets to ensure we operate within our risk appetite. For existing
ventures Risk Management facilitates growth through constant dialogue and sound-boarding providing
necessary resources and support as needed while further embedding analysis and monitoring within
NIBC.
In the light of the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, NIBC established an IBOR Transition
programme in early 2019. The programme is a cross-departmental effort between Corporate Client
Offering, Retail Client Offering, Treasury, IT, Operations, Finance, Risk, Legal and Compliance. NIBC
closely follows market and regulatory developments and takes actions that are in line with these
developments. During 2019, NIBC duly responded to the IBOR Transition information request from
AFM and DNB. We believe that NIBC is aligned with market practices, based upon the general
feedback published by the regulators.
Pressure from the regulatory environment remains elevated; however, NIBC has been able to
strengthen its control framework within this backdrop and absorb the many regulatory requests and
on-site investigations. These spanned across a number of topics including but not limited to DNB
Credit Underwriting Standards, DNB onsite Internal Governance and Risk Management, Internal
Model Investigiation (IMI) follow-up, IRRBB follow-up, SIRA follow-up (Project Care), market risk,
Quantitative Impact Studies, IBOR transition, Climate Risk Data Survey, and Brexit Survey. Non-
financial risks, including know your customer and anti-money laundering, have received increased
attention and focus within the organisation on both the corporate and retail client offerings where
process and procedures are constantly improved to align with regulatory requirements. NIBC’s
smaller size allows for efficient internal insight and oversight and we have a constructive dialogue with
our regulators. Ongoing projects such as model improvements are on track and fully supported by
the Managing and Supervisory Boards.
Further work is being done on upcoming regulations such as Basel IV and the introduction of the
Non-Performing Exposure prudential backstop. With respect to the latter, NIBC is aware of the
potential impact where both our capital and the return on impacted transactions can absorb the

changes. Recent DNB draft requirements for residential mortgages, ahead of Basel IV, are already
part of the product offering and new ventures are conservatively initiated under the standardised
approach for capital requirements. Lastly, the outcome of the IMI has led to an increase in the RWAs
for the corporate loan portfolios. NIBC has a project team in place to implement additional measures
to address the observatoins raised by the regulator in its IMI report.
Risk governance
The overarching principles regarding risk management are laid down in our risk management
framework. The ultimate purpose is to enable ourselves to properly assess in a timely manner
whether our activities fit within our risk appetite and to provide insight into how we address
opportunities and challenges that various types of risk present.
Three lines of defence model
Our operations are structured along the three lines of defence risk management model. This implies
that the first line of defence is within the commercial business units. They are accountable and
responsible for day-to-day risk management activities such as managing each individual exposure on
the balance sheet, with the exception of distressed assets at the corporate bank. These assets are
managed by the RDA department which is part of the risk management organisation. The
management and responsibility of the first line of defence lies with the non-statutory members of the
Executive Committee (ExCo).
Our second line of defence lies within the Risk, Legal, Compliance and CSR departments. These
departments monitor and evaluate risks versus the risk appetite framework. The second line of
defence has an active advisory role in particular transactions and proposals. The CRO is head of the
second line.
The third line of defence is the Internal Audit (IA) department. This department provides objective
and independent assurance on the operations within the first and second lines of defence. IA helps to
accomplish our objectives by evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control
and governance. IA reports directly to the CEO and the Audit Committee (AC).
NIBC will focus on further development of the three lines of defence model to address modern ways
of cooperation, such as outsourcing contracts and managed services. These developments require
new arrangements to clearly assign responsibilities to the different parties involved in the related
processes.

Client privacy and data security
When confidential or personal information belongs to a client and is entrusted to NIBC we handle it
with the utmost care. Cybercrime and loss of data more generally is a risk for NIBC as well as for all
of our financial sector peers. In 2019 we carried out a large number of tests, continuously assessing
our information security and data protection measures, as part of our efforts to strengthen NIBC's
cyber security.
We have policies in place that require staff to ensure that we do not leave confidential or personal
data unattended such as a clear desk policy, information security policies, and additional security
controls. We facilitate the use of secure communication channels wherever possible and require staff
to adhere to security considerations for sensitive or confidential information. Third parties may not
use our equipment, software or databases unless authorised. Our approach is detailed in our
Corporate Information Security Policy and our Data Protection Policy. We have a Record Keeping
Policy in place to ensure we adhere to legal requirements with respect to the retention of data.
We investigate every data breach incident made known to us: of these, during 2019 we assessed
approximately 15% as meeting the criteria to be reported to our data protection regulators. Whilst
none of these incidents were assessed as leading to a high risk for clients and no legal consequences
were identified, we take all data breaches – not just those which are reportable externally – very
seriously. We analyse each one for lessons to be learned and take appropriate follow-up actions.
Often these are in the nature of reinforcing employee awareness of the need for constant attention
to protecting client confidentiality and privacy, and we carry out ad hoc training where necessary to
supplement our regular awareness programme, which is mandatory for all employees.
Anti-fraud and anti-corruption
All staff receive mandatory training on NIBC’s Code of Conduct as well as on related compliance
policies such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery. These awareness and
learning initiatives demonstrate NIBC’s ongoing commitment towards good corporate governance
and to uphold the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).
In line with our commitment to the principles of the UNGC, NIBC does not accept or tolerate any
instance of bribery, corruption or fraud. Any NIBC employee found giving or accepting bribes, or
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 59
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
committing any other acts of corruption, will face disciplinary action. NIBC does not want to engage
with clients who have consistently violated the UNGC principles and do not provide any level of
commitment to improve.
Our anti-fraud framework emphasises prevention and timely detection. All staff are responsible for
the prevention, detection and deterrence of fraud. We familiarise ourselves with the types of
improprieties that might occur within our area of responsibility, and are alert to any indication of
irregularity. We always report actual or suspected fraud or misconduct, after which a special
investigation is launched, if appropriate. If fraud is established, action will be taken against violators.
Climate Risk
NIBC has a risk management approach in place with regard to ESG risks, including climate risk. This is
supported by clear oversight, a robust sustainability risk management framework and increasing
disclosures in support of our commitments, recognised standards, and regulatory requirements.
These aspects are described in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report.
Climate risk and certain other sustainability risks are increasingly becoming financial risks, while in the
past these were seen primarily as non-financial and reputational risks. For NIBC, we currently assess
physical climate risk to be a medium- to long-term financial risk for our corporate and retail clients.
We have not yet seen significant impacts on corporate clients’ own operations and only occasional
disruptions in corporate client supply chains. These have been the result of extreme weather events,
such as flooding, drought or dangerous storms due to rising global temperatures. Looking ahead, it is
likely these types of events will occur more frequently, reach additional regions and more visibly
impact the supply chains of our clients. These changes increase the risk of other environmental
impacts such as loss of biodiversity and habitat. At the same time our clients are increasingly aware of
these risks and are developing climate adaption strategies to make their supply chains and processes
more climate resilient.
There are no indications of material climate impacts on NIBC’s retail clients to date. A long-term
physical risk is related to water levels relative to homes in the Netherlands. This may result in damage
to wooden pilings used as foundations or may be in the form of floods. If this risk materialises, the
impacts will be regional and/or national, likely impacting the portfolios of all mortgage loan providers
including NIBC.
Transitional climate risks related to our portfolios are increasing and may materialise in the medium-
to long-term. An example is political risk surrounding climate policy. This aspect is influenced by the
short-termism inherent in political cycles and differences in views. This is increasing the likelihood of
large-scale social unrest during the transition and the potential for widespread job losses if
comprehensive national plans are not developed. Environmental regulation is being weakened in
certain countries, leading to variations in standards applied to different parts of any global supply
chain. In the long-term, retail clients may be impacted by socially-related climate impacts such as net
reduction of income due to increased costs or job loss.
To strengthen climate risk management, NIBC has developed innovative new tools to help identify
and assess the materiality of physical and transitional climate risks. We anticipate that these may lead
to additional insights and help us to quantify these risks. We are engaged with peer banks, regulators
and other stakeholders to share views and exchange best practices. Furthermore we have continued
our efforts to raise employee awareness about climate risk and other environmental and human
rights risks. Climate risk related to NIBC’s own operations are viewed to be less significant due to
steps that we have taken and continue to take as part of our climate mitigation efforts. Energy

In the risk appetite framework these six pillars are further specified into specific business statements.
Each quarter the relevant committees and the Managing Board review whether our quantitative and
qualitative performance is in line with the risk appetite.
Roles and responsibilities
NIBC has several committees in place with specific authorities and decision-making power with
respect to risk management:
■ Engagement committee (EC): Responsible for decision-making with regard to client
engagement and conflicts of interest including an assessment of the potential integrity risks when
engaging with a client.
■ Transaction committee (TC): The transaction committee has decision-making power with
regards to credit transactions, assessment of credit proposals and the monitoring of credit related
risks. The TC approves and monitors all transaction proposals which cause NIBC to assume credit
risk. Further, the TC decides on impairments and write-offs and reviews all individual transactions
at least annually.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 61
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ Investment committee (IC): The IC is the delegated authority to decide on equity, mezzanine,
subordinated, and other equity related financial products. The IC assesses new investment
proposals and periodically determines the valuation of our equity portfolio.
■ Strategic investment committee (SIC):The SIC has decision-making power on equity,
mezzanine debt, subordinated debt and senior debt granted to strategic participations and/or
strategic investments.
■ Risk management committee (RMC): The RMC decides on policies, measurement methods,
monitoring, and controlling of all risk types. The role of the RMC is to safeguard our risk appetite
by monitoring all risks we are exposed to, thereby looking backwards as well as forwards.
■ Asset & liability committee (ALCO): The ALCO monitors and controls capital ratios, liquidity,
earnings and market risk. As ALCO is responsible for liquidity, they also decide on funding plans
and large funding transactions.
Risk profile
Our business is organised in such a way that we place great emphasis on who the client is. Second,
we base our lending decisions on cash flows as this is what ultimately repays our loans. And third, we
are primarily a collateralised lender and this is an important determinant in reducing the risk profile of
the bank. We have a preference to finance well-collateralised products such as receivables and
mortgage loans on real estate.
In order to reduce the risk profile we have to look beyond our lending activities. One of the non-
lending activities relates to minority equity participations in clients and investment funds. In 2019 the
equity investment portfolio increased from EUR 215 million to EUR 303 million. Positive revaluation
as well as new transactions have led to the increase. On the new investment side we have focused on
smaller exposures, increasing granularity of the equity investment portfolio.
In 2019 the risk profile of the performing corporate loan portfolio showed some signs of
improvement, as the expected loss of the performing portfolio decreased and the corporate
exposure in arrears decreased to 1.2% (2018: 2.7%). Origination with lower expected credit loss than
the existing portfolio has contributed to this reduction. On the other hand, the watchlist of corporate
loan exposures increased to EUR 302 million (2018: EUR 261 million), indicating that there is also
pressure oncertain clients from the uncertain economic climate. New impairments mostly relate to
the Energy sector and Leverged Finance products which continue to experience pressure, displaying
risk characteristics that are less in line with our risk appetite. Within the Shipping portfolio the
amount of non-performing loans decreased in 2019. Shipping assets are well collateralised and
therefore impairments are relatively limited.
The sectors and products above remain challenging, and consistent with our rebalancing strategy we
decided to decrease exposures to Energy, Shipping and Leveraged Finance. In 2019 this has resulted
in a significant decrease in exposure for all three areas. Growth in the corporate client portfolio
comes from more granular offerings such as receivables financing and lease receivables, which is in
line with the strategy to increase granularity of NIBC's exposures.
The housing market in the Netherlands has continued to improve in 2019. This is reflected in the
performing mortgage loan portfolio by a decrease of the expected loss from 9 bps to 7bps. In 2019
shorter tenor mortgage loan origination has also added to the rebalancing of our risk profile within
the retail portfolio. Shorter tenors also provide repricing power, more flexibility and lower liquidity
risk.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Overview of risk types
NIBC is exposed to a wide range of risks. We distinguish the following: credit risk, investment risk,
interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Our risk management policy is aimed
at seeking an acceptable level of credit and investment risk, while minimising the other risk types. The
risk appetite framework is set up to accommodate decision making.
The following table displays a breakdown of our exposures and the types of risk associated with that
exposure. The amounts include both drawn and undrawn amounts. In the remainder of the section
we will elaborate on the various risk types and the way these are managed.

Credit risk
Credit risk is one of the risks inherent to our business model. By lending to our clients we are
exposed to the risk of the counterparty not being able to repay the loan. We continuously monitor
our clients' financial performance and take remedial action if we believe the risk of a client defaulting
on their obligation has increased.
We mitigate credit risk by placing emphasis on the collateral pledged to us in the transactions we do.
In case a client defaults on its obligation, the option to collect and sell the collateral can be exercised
as a last resort, thereby significantly reducing the amount of non-recoverable assets.

Commercial Real Estate Energy Financial Sponsors & Leveraged Finance
Fintech & Structured Finance Infrastructure Lease Lending Mid Market Corporates Shipping
As indicated in previous paragraphs, we have seen a changing balance between the risks and rewards
in the Energy and Leveraged Finance sectors. As a consequence we have deliberately chosen to be
more conservative and reduce our exposures in these sectors as well as in Shipping. We seek to
grow in granular products such as receivable financing which is demonstrated by the increase in this
area as well as in lease receivables.
In the corporate client offering we mainly engage with clients rated a 5 or 6 on the internal credit risk
scale, which corresponds to a BB and B rating in external rating agencies' scales. This translates to a
probability of default ranging between 0.61% and 4.77%. As the exposures are concentrated in the
sub-investment grade category, we emphasise the collateral pledged to us. Collateral can take several
forms, such as receivables and leases, but also mortgages on real estate and vessels. As a result, our
loss given default (LGD) on corporate loans is typically in the range of 10% to 25%.
The Dutch housing market showed a continued strong performance in 2019, which is evidenced in
the low credit losses in the portfolio. In the retail client offering, where we offer mortgage loans to
our clients, three different types of mortgages are distinguished from a risk perspective: owner-
occupied mortgage loans with NHG, owner-occupied mortgage loans without NHG, and Buy-to-Let
mortgage loans. NHG refers to the Dutch mortgage guarantee scheme that ensures that the lender
64 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
is largely compensated for post-foreclosure losses on mortgage loans, except for risk-sharing of 10%.
A good indicator of the riskiness of a mortgage loan is the loan-to-value ratio. The Dutch housing
market has displayed considerable improvements over the past years, causing loan-to-value ratios in
our mortgage loan portfolio to further decrease.

Development of credit quality
In determining the credit quality of the loan book we look at four measures indicating an increased
risk level. We differentiate between the following measures:
■ Forborne exposure: defined by the European Banking Authority (EBA). A client is considered to be
forborne if the client is facing financial difficulties and NIBC has granted a concession over and
beyond market practice to the borrower;
■ Non-performing exposure: is defined in line with the EBA. A client is considered non-performing if
that client is in default, or if a performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional
forbearance measures, or becomes more than 30 days past-due;
■ Defaulted exposure: as defined by the CRR / CRD IV definition. A counterparty is considered to
be in default when credit review leads to the conclusion that the probability of default is 100%;
■ Impaired exposure: defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting
standard. Facilities are considered to be impaired if the Transaction Committee (TC) decides on an
impairment amount for that facility.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 65
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Due to our medium size, we are able to oversee the portfolio and have thorough knowledge of the
specific situations our clients are in. This positions us well to identify potential threats at an early
stage, enabling us to intensify contact with the client. If the situation persists and the credit quality of a
client begins to weaken, the client is placed on our watch list. From this moment onwards we start to
closely monitor the developments at the client with the goal to work with our client to resolve credit
issues early and to avoid further deterioration. The watch list consists of exposures that show an
increased level of riskiness but are not managed by the RDA department. The reduction of credit risk
becomes the main priority once an exposure is transferred to the watch list. For watch list items we
require a quarterly review if the exposure exceeds EUR 10 million and a semi-annual review if the
exposure is smaller than EUR 10 million. If the situation at the client deteriorates further and the
probability of default significantly increases, the file is transferred to RDA where several options for
minimising losses are drafted. Following review the best alternatie is executed.
In the retail client offering we are exposed to credit risk through mortgage loans. Clients receive
transparent and clear conditions on these products. In case a client faces financial distress resulting in
arrears, the file is transferred to our in-house arrears management team. Subsequently we will
contact the client to determine the source of the financial distress and to make a plan to prevent
foreclosure. As a client-focused bank it is in our culture to cooperate with clients to prevent
foreclosure.

The decrease in non-performing exposures is due to the rebalancing of portfolios as well as write-
offs, predominantly in Leveraged Finance.
Investment risk
For NIBC, investment risk arises when taking equity positions in other companies and the risk is that
the value of the investment deteriorates. Within our equity portfolio we distinguish between direct
and indirect investments. Direct investments are equity exposures with which NIBC has directly
invested in one of its clients, whereas indirect investments are exposures to investment funds.
The equity portfolio demonstrated solid performance in 2019. For new business we aim for smaller
direct investments in our clients, preferably through offering a combination of senior and mezzanine
lending, combined with an equity participation.

Interest rate risk in the banking book
Interest rate risk in the Banking book (IRRBB) is the risk of losses from interest rate sensitive positions
in non-trading activities due to movements in interest rates. Interest rate movements can have an
impact on cash flows and present values. NIBC has a framework in place which keeps track of
interest related risks in our economic value and our earnings. To monitor the impact on economic
value, basis point value (BPV) and value at risk (VaR) are calculated on a daily basis. To assess the
impact on net interest income NIBC uses earnings at risk (EaR) by calculating the 12-months earnings
impact of an instantaneous 100 bps and gradual 200 bps upward or downward shift in interest rates
per currency. At the end of 2019 the 100 bps EaR amounted to EUR 10 million (2018:
EUR 13 million). Next to this, NIBC uses several dynamic analyses by modelling the development of
its balance sheet in line with the business plan, taking into account refinancing and reinvestments.
In principle NIBC hedges all interest positions to 3-month EURIBOR/LIBOR by entering into plain
vanilla swaps. During 2018, NIBC further optimised its interest hedging structure. This resulted in
more efficient use of on-balance sheet hedging and a lower hedging swap exposure. Only a certain
part of the interest bearing assets related to our non-interest bearing capital is unhedged. This is
identified as the strategic mismatch exposure.
The European Benchmark Regulation (BMR) which will come into force in 2020 has an impact on the
risk-free rate, currently EONIA and EURIBOR. EONIA will be replaced by European Short Term Rate
(ESTER) and there may be a change in the determination of EURIBOR/LIBOR, or a complete
replacement. The transition towards these new rates requires adjustments in ISDA agreements, loan
documentation, risk management models, interest rate risk hedging and hedge accounting. NIBC has
set up an IBOR transition programme to investigate the impact and implement the required changes.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates,
exchange rates and share prices, as well as other variables that are not directly observable, such as
volatilities and correlations.
The overall market risk in NIBC’s trading book is limited, as is also exhibited by the amount of Basel
III / Pillar I regulatory capital required for this activity, which only comprises 1.1% of the total
regulatory capital. In the trading book, excluding NIBC's capital market activities (Fixed Income, DCM
and ECM), NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and USD yield curves. The limits for
the trading book are moderate and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the Asset and
Liability Committee on a monthly basis. NIBC’s policy is not to take any active currency positions.
When currency positions exceed small facilitating limits, NIBC’s policy is to enter into hedging
transactions. NIBC’s overall open foreign currency position was EUR 23.6 million as at 31 December
2019.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 69
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk (in the trading book only) and
credit spread risk (in both the trading and banking book). The capital requirement for market risk is
based on internal models for the trading book, excluding NIBC's capital market activities, and on the
Standardised Approach for NIBC's capital market activities. The capital requirement for the overall
foreign currency position of the bank is calculated in accordance with the Standardised Approach.
The objectives of the market risk function are to measure, report and limit the market risk of NIBC
in accordance with NIBC’s market risk framework. NIBC has defined interest rate risk, credit spread
risk and traded equity risk limits and monitors these positions on a daily basis, reporting to the Asset
and Liability Committee once a month. The risk management and control function is independent of
any trading activities. Any significant breach of market risk limits is required to be reported to the
CRO for immediate action. Market risk analyses all 'overshootings' (i.e. occasions where either the
hypothetical or actual profit and loss account exceeds the VaR) in the trading book and reports them
to both the CRO and the DNB in accordance with Article 366 point 5 of the CRR.
NIBC uses multiple risk metrics to monitor and manage market risk. These include interest BPV,
credit BPV, interest VaR and credit VaR. These metrics are calculated on a daily basis and are
reviewed by the market risk department.
In addition to the use of sensitivities and VaR metrics, NIBC has developed a number of stress tests.
These stress tests consist of both historical events and potential extreme market conditions. Market
risk stress tests are conducted and reported regularly, both at portfolio level and on a consolidated
basis.
Liquidity risk
The risk of not being able to meet obligations as they become due is called liquidity risk. The aim is to
maintain a comfortable liquidity position to enable ourselves to fund new client assets, as well as to
repay our liabilities when they become due. Managing the maturity of both assets and liabilities is key
in successful liquidity risk management and we maintain sufficient liquidity buffers to meet our
obligations in a potential stress scenario.
The responsibility for managing liquidity risk lies with the ALCO. Liquidity requirement forecasts from
the corporate and retail client businesses, combined with the associated liquidity forecasts and several
stress scenarios are presented to ALCO every two weeks.
he management of liquidity risk entails that we have a diverse source of funding types, so we can tap
into any of the various funding markets when we require new funding. When a certain funding
source suddenly becomes unavailable or unattractive for NIBC, we have alternative sources available
to attract the required funding.
During 2019 we continued to actively manage the funding mix and tenor. The amount of secured
funding increased due to new issuances.

Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or
systems, from human error, fraud, or external events. Operational risk includes legal risk and
compliance risk. NIBC also includes reputational risk; however, strategic risks are not included.
Reputational risk is defined as the potential risk arising from negative perception on the part of
NIBC’s stakeholders.
NIBC strives for a ‘no surprises’ operating environment by, effectively managing operational risk
across all its business lines, banking activities and countries in a transparent and consistent way.
Operational risk management is embedded in day-to-day processes. Every NIBC business unit and
international office has an operational risk management ‘Champion’. These employees assess their
department’s activities for potential operational risks, monitor the control mechanisms to mitigate,
avoid, transfer or accept these risks and coordinate ways of resolving loss-making events. They
promote awareness for operational risks within their departments.
Regulators and society remain increasingly interested in operational risk factors and what banks do to
prevent any wrongdoing. Increased attention is placed on Client Due Diligence (CDD), Know Your
Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) measures.
Capital adequacy
The most important ratio to assess our capital position is the CET 1 ratio. Related to this measure
are the Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios. These ratios are calculated based on CRR / CRD IV
regulations.
In 2019, the development of our capital ratios was characterised by regulatory changes. the primary
impact resulted from the IML effectively a 30% RWA add-on for the corporate loan portfolio as of
Q3 2019. On the contrary, rebalancing of our corporate loan portfolio resulted in a decrease of
RWAs by EUR 320 million. Further details on the development of our CET 1 ratio are described in
the section Financial Review.
To align with regulatory treatment of interim profits NIBC has adjusted the reporting solvency ratios
with effect from 2019. consequently, the 2018 comparative figures include no non-eligible profits as
the full year profits were distributed to the shareholder of the company.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 71
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Operational risk RWAs are determined by a 3-year moving average of operating income. As
operating income increased over the past years, so did the RWAs related to operational risk.

1 As from 2019, non-eligible profits attributable to the shareholders are no longer added to regulatory capital.
Economic capital
In addition to regulatory capital, Economic Capital (EC) is also calculated. EC is the amount of capital
needed as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based on our assessment of risks. It
differs from Basel's regulatory capital calculation, as specific risk characteristics of the business
activities are assessed in a different manner than the required regulatory methodology. The EC is
based on a one-year horizon with a 99.9% confidence level. This confidence level means that there is
a probability of 0.1% that losses in a period of one year will be larger than the allocated EC.

OUR PEOPLE
At NIBC we strongly believe that our people represent our three core competences, entrepreneurial,
professional and inventive, towards the outside stakeholders. For serving our clients our people are
our key assets. Consequently, NIBC continuously invests in the development of its people to enable
them to grow in order to make a difference at decisive moments for its clients. This contiuous
development of employees’ capabilities and commitment is pivotal. Our corporate values –
professional, entrepreneurial and inventive - are the cornerstone for NIBC’s organisation and culture
and therefore a recurring theme in our people's development. Three major classifications that give an
insight into our people-oriented activities and employee related benefits, i.e. facts, figures and
measurements; employer branding and new developments; developing people based on our values.
By doing so we link our external promise to our internal culture and capacity to adapt to change and
deliver. Our ‘Think YES’ campaign is mirrored internally, where we think in opportunities for our
people, supporting their development and well-being.
Facts, Figures and Measurements

Employee experience
Measuring our employee experience again in 2019, we set out an Employee Experience Survey to
gain insights into how our employees rate our culture, our leadership and their work experience by
measuring the levels of engagement and commitment in our organisation. The four pillars of this
survey are Engagement, Commitment, Employership and Leadership.
76 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The survey is in line with NIBC’s effort to build a positive and open culture in which we recognise
employees by celebrating their success and sharing feedback. Each manager leading a team with more
than five employee responses received a feedback report. Managers and employees jointly discussed
the outcomes of the Employee Experience Survey to develop an action plan.
The overall conclusion of this survey is that in general employees find NIBC a good organisation to
work for and our employees are proud to work for NIBC.
High participation of 81% (2018: 79%) in the survey provided solid insights, which led to the
identification of the organisation’s strengths and opportunities. The proportion of committed
employees (commitment refers to the connection our employees feel towards our organisation) is
75% (2018: 73%) which is a positive result but also leaves room for improvement.
Our focus on leadership, e.g. through courses, coaching and round-tables on themes regarding
management and leadership, has led to a very good score of 80% (2018: 76%), outperforming the
Financial Services benchmark of 74%. Another important organisational performance indicator,
employership, which gives an indication of whether we enable employees to perform optimally,
scored a satisfactory 72% (2018: 72%). The level of engagement in the financial sector (engagement
is the degree to which employees get inspiration from their work) is significantly lower than in other
sectors. In our view this is one of the most critical success factors going forward. We therefore aim to
increase our current score of 35% (2018: 38%). To realise this we will continue to pay attention to
working efficiently, communication and perceived workload. We continue to raise awareness and
understanding of health and wellness issues amongst our employees to keep on boosting their vitality
and productivity. Furthermore we continue to invest in the development of our employees by
offering them feedback, coaching and training, development programmes and e-learnings.
Absenteeism & vitality
Recognising the importance of a healthy workforce, we are very happy to continue a very low
absenteeism rate of 2.0 % in 2019 (2018: 2.1%).
To support and enhance the health and vitality of our people we offered a variety of programmes
and initiatives to enable a healthy lifestyle and work attitude. Our NIBC Vitality team offered a lot of
triggers that made employees more aware on three vitality pillars: physical health, mental health and
nutrition.
We participated with 70 teams in the Virgin Global Challenge focusing on vitality, through awareness,
exercise, nutrition and work-life balance. The Challenge combined attention to lifestyle with an
internal competition, which created a positive atmosphere within NIBC. In 2019 we announced that
we will participate in this Challenge again in early 2020, for which 52 teams of 7 participants
subscribed. Apart from this challenge, we participated in a variety of sporting events, such as the
110km Gerrie Knetemann Classic and organised our own bootcamp and grand slam tennis
tournament.
Throughout the year we have also created awareness on the impact of food on health, by means of
offering new and healthy menus in our restaurant, supplied by a newly contracted caterer. Employees
were also invited to a reading on the effects of wholesome food.
Other initiatives that we took to support our health are a renewed focus on Acitivity Based Working,
offering a flexible approach to the way we work in our physical offices, optimally using our digital
workplace and recognising the behaviour that supports this way of working.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 77
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Furthermore, we offered training courses focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress and building on
resilience, and alternative ways of using our brainpower.
With all these attractive initiatives, all employees have contributed to NIBC’s low absenteeism rate.
Training spent
In 2019 we spent over EUR 3,500 (2018: over EUR 3,200) per employee on training and educational
programmes. This is close to the top quartile when benchmarked with financial services, and close to
the top decile compared to general industries. The amount is slightly higher than in 2018 and includes
a personal development budget of EUR 2,000 over 2018 and 2019 that enabled and motivated all
staff to develop themselves beyond their current job and tasks. Moreover, these investments increase
both the professional capabilities and competences of our people as well as their employability.
Inhouse courses
Using our own training facilities, we have offered over 25 inhouse courses, either facilitated by internal
or external trainers. We see an increased drive and willingness with our own employees who are
subject matter experts to teach and share knowledge. Popular topics facilitated by NIBC colleagues
are introductions to financial expertise of specific teams, swaps, excel, data management, learning &
development, lean foundation and social media training.
Employer Branding & new developments
Employer branding is increasingly important in labour markets that quickly change. Where we need
employees that live up to our NIBC values we feel that the presentation of our employer brand is
crucial. Therefore we focus on ‘Banking on Trust', diversity and our core HR base.
Banking on Trust
Core of our employer brand is that at NIBC we are mindful of our responsibility towards helping
build and maintain trust in the financial services industry. We believe trust is the foundation on which
the sector must be based, and we have consistently looked to make it the basis of our company’s
culture. To support this aim, we have continued to run our Banking on Trust programme and made
concerted efforts through our focus on sustainable culture and behaviour. Each month the Managing
Board takes the Bankers' Oath from all new employees, thereby emphasising the importance of trust
in our behaviour.
During the year, we continued the Compliance & Integrity awareness programme that is based on the
revised Code of Conduct, and reflects the most up-to-date standards in our industry. This dedicated
programme has continued to raise employees’ awareness about our Compliance & Integrity policy
framework for dealing with integrity related matters, e.g. through a mandatory Code of Conduct/
Compliance e-learning. The Compliance & Integrity training is also obligatory for all new employees
upon joining NIBC.
Diversity & Inclusiveness
We believe that diversity is critical to our ability to succeed and achieve sustainable success. We are
committed to creating a stimulating work environment for people from all backgrounds, that is open
to different ways of thinking. In 2019, we continued to pay close attention to all elements of our
diversity goals.
Diversity across age segments showed balance in 2019. Twenty-on percent of our employees were
under 30 years of age (2018: 19%) and 23% of employees were age 50 or older (2018: 23%).
78 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The gender diversity for our organisation slightly increased with 33% female staff (2018: 32%). Senior
management remained stable in gender diversity to 15% (2018: 15%). We are fully committed to
further continue our efforts and structural attention for inclusiveness and gender diversity.
We realise that improving diversity ratios is a long-term process and we will continue to strive to
meet our ambitions. We have a Diversity Committee in place which is tasked with researching our
current behaviours and recommending ways to achieve a more inclusive environment at NIBC. One
of the key priorities for the committee in 2019 was creating awareness and supporting our diversity
goals.
Actions to enhance gender diversity by the Diversity Committee in 2019 were focused on increasing
awareness on the topic of diversity, decreasing (gender) bias in recruitment and facilitate equal
development opportunities.
1. To increase awareness on (gender) diversity, multiple events were organised, e.g. Ladies Lunch, live
interview with 'Topvrouw van het Jaar 2018' Eugenie van Wiechen, Young Talent of the Year 2019
and celebration of International Women’s Day.
2. We took steps to increase diversity across the company through our recruitment processes by
focusing on female candidates on our recruitment short lists.
3. Moreover, diversity in general, and the male-female balance specifically, are explicitly considered in
our talent programmes and performance management. To address gender imbalances specifically,
we have introduced engagements, like mentorships and dedicated workshops and programmes,
aimed at retaining and further developing talented female employees. We have a partnership with
‘Talent to the Top’ and some of our talented women have participated in 'Cross Organisation
Mentoring' and 'Boardroom coaching'.
4. Advised by the Diversity Committee the Executive Committee adopted diversity targets regarding
staff inflow, outflow and career development. In the longer term will lead to realisation of the
overall target to have a minimum of 30% females at all function levels and within each BU. In this
light the ambition going forward is amongst others to have 30% of all promotions to be female, to
have 50% females in our Analyst Talent Programme.
Increasing diversity among senior managers was a key focus area in 2019. Our objective is at least
one third of our Supervisory Board and Managing Board members to be female. NIBC's Executive
Committee meets this objective. NIBC is aware that it falls short of this goal with respect to the
Managing Board (nil on a total of three) and the overall senior positions (director level and higher),
where the percentage remained the same as last year at 15% (2018: 15%). With regard to the
Supervisory Board, the ratio of 29% is close to our objective.
NIBC will continue to address this topic as high priority. In the case of a vacancy in the Managing
Board or the Supervisory Board, the regular policy is applied in which we ask the executive search to
shortlist at least 50% female candidates.
Human capital
NIBC invests significantly in human capital, developing its people personally and professionally, and
providing a stimulating work environment that values diversity and treats everyone with respect.
NIBC has zero tolerance for all forms of discrimination with respect to employment and occupation
including verbal, physical and sexual harassment. Furthermore, we have systems and processes in
place to actively manage and stimulate equal compensation.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 79
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
We comply with to national employment legislation in the countries in which we are active and make
use of best practices. Respecting and protecting human rights and embracing diversity are embedded
in our Code of Conduct.
In this light, we are very proud that NIBC’s Eva Kool was a nominee in the Young Talent category of
the 2019 Women of the Year awards (Topvrouw van het Jaar). Twenty-five candidates from leading
Dutch corporates were nominated under the theme of ‘empowering young female talent'. These
awards help to promote cultural change and raise awareness for corporate gender diversity.
To learn of other organisations we participated in the cross company ‘Boardroom Coaching’
programme of ‘Talent to the Top’. The purpose of this programme is to match top executive coaches
with high potential women in participating organisations.
Another talent event that we participated in was the Dutch ‘HR Talent of the Year Award, where
Charlotte Mercadié won the third audience prize.
Recruitment & new channels
Managing our employer brand means that we increasingly focus on being entrepreneurial and using
social media, our own network and gamification to enhance our exposure to the labour market. Our
own ‘ambassador colleagues’ are supported in introducing new employees to NIBC. Recruitment
efforts have continued to include engagement with selected student associations, for which we
organised several in-house days and attended various recruitment events. Targeted in-house
recruitment events, such as a ‘Ladies’ Lunch’, help us to create more diversity in our organisation.
Since learning and development is pivotal within NIBC, we continued to give working students
opportunities in our organisation.
Works Council 
NIBC’s Works Council (Council) represents the interests of all staff based in the Netherlands. It
currently has 11 members from all departments and levels across the bank. As the voice of the
employees, the Council regularly meets with the members of the Managing Board and HR team in
both formal and informal settings. Twice a year it meets with members of the Supervisory Board.
Since 2014, NIBC has opted not to be part of the collective labour agreement for banking institutions
in the Netherlands. Therefore, the Council – as the representative of all NIBC’s employees on the
payroll in the Netherlands – became senior management’s direct interlocutor for negotiations in this
important area. In 2019, the negotiations have led to revisions in the employee benefit scheme.
The Council advised on two intended board decisions in 2019: on the IT reorganisation (‘IT Refocus’)
and on new agreements regarding insurance for partial disability. The Council approved three board
proposals: adjustments to the Staff Manual based on the new labour agreement, new pension
regulation and the smoking ban for NIBC buildings and terrain.
Given the challenges facing NIBC and the banking sector, the Council remains focused on the
employability of NIBC’s staff and on NIBC’s competitive position as an attractive employer. This was
reflected in the Council’s position with respect to reorganisations, diversity and labour agreements.
The Council actively monitors employee engagement and other metrics (e.g. absence ratios) in order
to gauge the effect of increasing workload. This may be caused by competitive pressure, the effect of
reorganisations and increased activity levels of NIBC in 2019. The Council has also been actively
involved with multiple other developments such as mobility policies and employability while also
80 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
maintaining regular contact with the Works Councils of other Dutch banks and financial institutions in
order to exchange best practices.
Pensions and benefits 
NIBC uses a modern set of employee benefits, which are flexible and well aligned with the realities of
our business. An important aspect is the discretionary approach to compensation and benefits, which
takes into account a range of considerations, including KPIs and country-wide benchmarks. This
enables us to reward our talented staff well and to retain them.
Similarly, our pension plan is a collective-defined contribution (CDC) scheme for salaries up to
EUR 107,593, ensuring that pension costs have become predictable. For 2018-2020 the contribution
for NIBC is determined at 26.2% and the contribution of the employee at 4.2%, whilst the gross
contribution by NIBC for pensions above the fiscal maximum is set at 25% for all ages.
Developing our people based on our values
‘We enable people to grow in order to make a difference’
To compete effectively in our industry, we must develop ourselves at a faster pace and to a higher
standard than many of our (larger) competitors. Competition is tough within the financial services
industry as a whole and in the labour market the banking sector is still perceived as less attractive
than before the financial crisis. But, as a mid-sized bank we have, in some ways, a more compelling
offer for employees than our larger peers; one in which they will have greater responsibilities,
influence and impact from the start. The ‘Think YES’ campaigns have helped to position NIBC in the
highly competitive labour market.
NIBC Introduction Programme
The NIBC Introduction Programme was organised on a regular basis in 2019 to enhance the
onboarding of new employees. Besides presentations on the strategy of the bank and on various
parts of organisation, special attention was paid to the importance of our corporate values, the
NIBC3. All new employees have taken the Bankers’ Oath.
NIBC Academy
We have a solid training and learning offering in the NIBC Academy, our virtual centre for continuous
training and learning, enabling us to offer development in a more customised and effective way. It ran
a total of 25 modular courses in 2019, some of these in our own training facilities. The Academy's
approach is to empower employees to take responsibility for their own development, through a
range of channels, including on-demand online workshops and classroom courses. Staff can also
create their own learning initiatives (both virtually and physically) as a result of which we also offer
training courses that are offered by employees who are subject matter experts.
Besides developing professional skills we increasingly focus on skills that make our staff more inventive
and entrepreneurial. Our Dare2Develop programme is a clear example. This one year invitation-only
programme is aimed at our talented young professionals at mid-career level. The programme is
developed in close cooperation with the participants and enhances personal effectiveness in
influencing, consulting, negotiation and innovation. The connection with NIBC’s strategy is made by
deep dive business cases and the active involvement of senior management through mentoring and
coaching.
Other examples of NIBC's efforts to support its staff to continuously develop are the following.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 81
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ To build on our basic financial and lending skills, in 2019 we offered a number of professional
training courses such as Financial & Cashflow Analysis and a Fitch Credit Course.
■ Rebalancing our training offer means that we also focus on training stress and resilience, for which
we set up various training opportunities.
■ The Management Development Programme and the ‘Coach-in-1-Day’ training courses have
continued to help develop employees' personal and management skills.
■ A total of 23 participants completed our dedicated Talent Programme in 2019. This Talent
Programme for young bankers has been designed to appeal to a new generation of bankers. The
modular and flexible approach is continuously tailored to the needs and demands of new
generations.
■ A group of 21 talented employees participated in the Orchestrating Winning Performance
programme of IMD in Lausanne. In this energetic programme they gained the newest insights on
various business and management topics.
■ A formal mentor programme was launched in which NIBC mentors were trained and matched
with employees who subscribed for a mentor.
■ Learning & Development workshops were organised for various target groups to have a dialogue
on the NIBC learning philosophy and offering.
■ All new joiners are offered a short training course on their ‘Insights Discovery’ personal profile to
make an early start with their personal development.
■ Short-term rotation initiatives called ‘Flying Goalies’ were very popular. This initiative represents
our entrepreneurial spirit as the initiative evolved from talents themselves, and offers opportunities
to talent who wish to step in projects at decisive moments.
Young NIBC 
The Young NIBC network is focused on connecting younger NIBC staff to each other and the bank.
Young NIBC identifies their needs and facilitates matching events, with a focus on learning about
NIBC’s organisation and culture and creating a professional network. One of the Young NIBC
activities in 2019 was a visit to a client in Cologne, a company in the beverage industry. Over 30 of
our young colleagues learned about their way of working and how to apply this at NIBC.
With Sustainability being a leading topic, Young NIBC members continued their work in collaboration
with Stichting Vitalis. With Vitalis, Young NIBC executed the outcome of the 2018 CSR challenge by
giving children on the Vitalis waiting list a pen pal. Young NIBC also participated in an ‘NL Doet’ event
and created presents for children. NL Doet is an organisation that hosts do-good events to which
groups of volunteers can subscribe. Participants feel that it is a fun and accessible way to positively
contribute to society.
In December, Young NIBC invited all NIBC colleagues to participate in a Christmas Box Packaging
Event at the ‘Voedselbank’ in Rotterdam. For the second year in row a lot of colleagues participated
in this very energetic and positive event that focused on helping those in need.
Apart from this, Young NIBC hosted the ‘Young Financials The Hague’ network in May. Over 100
youngsters from financial organisations in The Hague visited our office for this thematic event ‘ Young
and Old in the Workplace’.

controversial sectors (such as coal power and mining, extreme 
fossil fuels, weapons and firearms, tobacco, gambling, among 
others) and adheres to NIBC’s robust sustainability framework 
and policies. NIBC ensures this through pre-investment 
screening, borrower/transaction due diligence, NIBC’s internal 
assessments, monitoring and review processes. We provide 
transparency through detailed investor reporting and analysis: 
the CLO will report the portfolio composition from an ESG 
perspective to its investors quarterly.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
SUSTAINABILITY
At NIBC, we believe it is our responsibility to be a sustainable business for the benefit of future
generations. We are convinced that as a business that takes its social and environmental
responsibilities seriously, we are better able to manage our risks. Sustainability and innovation are
themes which will lead to promising opportunities in our markets.
We want to ensure that the services we provide are responsible and sustainable. Additionally, as a
financial services provider, we are well aware of the enormous responsibility we have in helping to
build and maintain trust in our industry.
Our day-to-day business decisions and interactions with clients are guided by established principles
and policies set out in our Code of Conduct, Business Principles, Corporate Values, Compliance
Framework and Sustainability Framework. These documents are available on our website. For many
years, we have steadily developed our sustainability agenda in close consultation with our
stakeholders.
Reporting principles
The 2019 NIBC Annual Report has been drafted in accordance with the Dutch Decree disclosure on
non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiele informatie), which came into effect on
24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-Financial Reporting
Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330).
This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Our GRI Content
Index and a materiality assessment can be found on the NIBC Annual Report website. Those
elements concerning Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting are
summarised in this Annual Report, whereas additional details and indicators are available in our
Sustainability Report.
Sustainable business
Sustainability is a part of NIBC’s core business strategy. We aim to create environmental and social
value as well as financial value at decisive moments for our clients and our stakeholders. While we
manage our sustainability and climate risks, we are also taking steps to pursue sustainable business
opportunities.
During 2019, NIBC pursued a new Sustainable Finance Framework to support corporate and retail
clients in their sustainability ambitions and create new opportunities. Through this Framework NIBC
can develop innovative green, social and sustainable financing solutions to enable access to sustainable
finance.
The Framework was developed based on leading guidelines such as the ICMA Green Loan Principles
and Social Loan Principles and with a view towards the upcoming EU Green Taxonomy. As a
signatory of UN Global Compact, we also aligned eligibility criteria with the principles of UNGC and
mapped expected impacts to the underlying targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
NIBC has engaged a specialist third party provider to review and assess the Framework. The review
will be completed during Q1 2020.
NIBC has prioritised several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of our business strategy.
This is based both on internal reflections as well as on discussions with clients and other stakeholders.
These SDGs include Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12), Economic Growth (SDG8),
86 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Industry & Innovation (SDG9), Sustainable Communities (SDG11), and Clean Energy (SDG7). By
focusing on these SDGs, we believe we will also contribute towards several other goals including
Good Health (SDG3), Gender Equality (SDG5) and Climate Action (SDG13) among others.
Importantly, these goals are linked to potential opportunities within our corporate and retail
businesses. During 2019, all employees within our corporate bank took part in a 'Sustainable Future'
initiative. The goal of the initiative was to increase awareness of each of the 17 SDGs. Sessions were
also held with each team to provide training on relevant human rights and environmental issues and
to deepen the alignment of business strategy to the goals.
How we manage sustainability
Our governance revolves around a system of checks and balances which ensures stakeholder views
are taken into account in our decision-making processes. NIBC's Managing Board is ultimately
responsible for all sustainability matters. ExCo members discuss and advise on sustainability strategy,
targets, planning and budget. The ExCo is also responsible for policies that impact NIBC’s culture and
ethics, such as the Code of Conduct. Any significant updates to the sustainability framework and
underlying policies are reviewed and approved by NIBC’s Risk Management Committee.
Responsibility for overseeing NIBC's sustainability agenda is delegated to the Sustainability Officer but
is primarily managed by and embedded in each business unit. Processes, roles and responsibilities are
defined to manage sustainability and take a precautionary approach.
Sustainability Officer
The NIBC Sustainability agenda is led by a dedicated full-time senior sustainability officer who is
responsible for catalysing sustainability and corporate social responsibility within the organisation. The
officer is part of the RLCC strategic business unit and a member of the RLCC senior leadership
team.
The officer is responsible for the set-up and implementation of the sustainability strategy, including
targets, planning and budget. He is up to date on all sustainability developments and is responsible for
engaging with our external stakeholders. The officer meets regularly with each business unit to
discuss progress and evaluate activities. Sustainability matters are monitored and reported periodically
to the ExCo and the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC), a Sub-Committee of NIBC's
Supervisory Board.
Sustainability is integrated into NIBC’s business strategy, and different departments are responsible for
managing sustainability risks and opportunities as part of their regular activities. For example, business
teams apply the Sustainability Framework in their client interactions, Facilities & Services manages
NIBC’s energy efficiency programme, and Human Resources are responsible for sustainability in our
human resource activities.
All new employees of NIBC Bank are informed of our approach to sustainability as part of
introduction sessions. These sessions include reflections on current topics in the world around us
such as climate risks, modern slavery, money laundering, whistleblowing and ethical business conduct.
Core standards
We manage the sustainability impact of our financings through our Sustainability Framework, which
can be found in the Sustainability section on our website. Our Sustainability Framework describes
governance, implementation and the roles and responsibilities within our organisation in regard to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 87
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
sustainability risks. NIBC defines sustainability risks to include environmental, climate, social, human
rights and governance risks.
The framework and its policies are based on internationally recognised conventions, standards and
best practices. Our approach to certain sectors and activities is further elaborated in our sustainability
sector policies. These standards provide the overarching principles and standards that form the basis
for NIBC to consider its engagement with clients across different industries.
During 2019 we reviewed all of our sustainability policies, updating where necessary to reflect
improvements, best practices and relevant societal developments. Policy updates reflected ongoing
dialogue and regular consultation with our stakeholders, for example dialogue with PAX, an Utrecht-
based civil society organisation, informed updates to NIBC’s weapons and human rights policies.
Discussions with representatives of Milieudefensie have led to clarifications which have improved
NIBC’s environmental policy and sector sustainability policies.
Due diligence and monitoring
NIBC's policies commit us to performing ESG due diligence and assessments of relevant and material
environmental risks, climate risks, human rights risks and governance risks for all corporate clients and
transactions. We aim to cover 100% of our new corporate loans. In our Non-Financial Key Figures,
we have reported that ESG due diligence and assessments were performed by NIBC for 100% of
new corporate loans, an indicator that we are living up to this commitment.
New products and significant changes to existing products are assessed for potential human rights
and environmental risks. Retail sustainability risks are managed at a portfolio level. Suppliers are
required to meet our human rights, environment and anti-corruption standards and are evaluated as
part of NIBC’s Know Your Supplier (KYS) due diligence process.
Additional testing is performed from time to time to ensure our high standards are maintained. For
example during 2019, we tested for the presence of gender bias in our retail mortgage product
offering. No evidence of gender discrimination was found across the scenarios that were tested.
During 2019 NIBC’s Innovation Lab developed experimental new tools which may help to further
strengthen our due diligence and monitoring of environmental risks and human rights risks of
corporate clients and suppliers. Input was received from leading civil society organisations. These
developments may also lead to new insights or additional sustainability performance indicators which
may be published in future reports.
Importantly the innovative techniques used in these experimentations related to sustainability may
lead to other innovations in other areas and activities within NIBC, thereby ultimately benefiting
customers, investors and other stakeholders.
Risks and Outcomes
NIBC recognises our corporate responsibility to respect the environment, protect biodiversity, and
take action to mitigate climate change in support of the Paris Climate Agreement and SDG13
Climate Action. Our long-term objective is to achieve these targets in our operations and financings
ahead of the national deadlines.
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity are signs of unprecedented pressure on the
environment and the planet’s ecological limits. NIBC is committed to preserving natural capital by
88 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
reducing negative impacts on biodiversity and the environment by facilitating the transition towards
more responsible business practices.
The urgency and scale of global impacts necessitate that NIBC contributes to a meaningful and
substantial reduction in emissions by 2030. In practice, this means supporting business and
communities to transform, particularly in the way that they source and consume. It also means that
we must continue to take steps in our own operations. Innovation and the energy transition are two
themes which we see across our business lines.
NIBC supports its clients in their transition towards more sustainable business and protecting natural
capital. The main long-term climate risks for NIBC are likely to be physical risks related to flooding
and drought due to rising global temperatures. These changes increase the risk of other
environmental impacts such as loss of biodiversity and habitat.
Transitional climate risks such as political risk surrounding climate policy and the risk of societal
disruptions are increasing in the short to medium term. For example, recent large-scale protests have
been organised on the Malieveld in the Hague and in other locations. Our retail and corporate clients
face technology risks as existing technologies will need to be replaced with more efficient ones,
processes will need to be redesigned and fossil-fuel lock-ins removed. Additional detail in regard to
physical and transitional climate risks are reported in the Risk Management section.
Our climate adaption strategy is to curb potential climate, biodiversity and other environmental risks
through client and transaction due diligence, stakeholder engagement and by supporting companies in
their transition toward more sustainable business. For example, NIBC’s Commercial Real Estate team
is supporting entrepreneurial companies which develop near 'energy neutral' buildings (Bijna Energie
Neutral Gebouw, 'BENG'), pushing further innovation in energy efficiency. This approach also
contributes to national and European objectives to increase resource efficiency of real estate in line
with commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.
By comparison the risk of negative impacts on the climate from NIBC’s own operations are less
significant due in part to steps that we have taken and continue to take as part of our climate
mitigation efforts. Since 2010, we have measured our direct emissions, realised substantial reductions
and compensated for any remaining direct emissions. NIBC’s current certified gold standard carbon
offset programme with Climate Neutral Group extends through 2020. These offsets make NIBC
carbon neutral in regard to the direct emissions from our own operations. The offsets support
emission reductions in Africa, ensure clean water for these local communities, promote gender
equality and social development of women.
NIBC believes that respect for human rights is a basic responsibility, towards our own employees, as
well as towards those people who are affected directly or indirectly by our actions. NIBC endorses
human rights as formulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO core conventions and
the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
New guidance for responsible business conduct in corporate lending was published in November by
the OECD. NIBC has published an overview aligned with the UNGP Reporting Framework in our
Sustainability Report. Human rights due diligence is integrated into our sustainability due diligence and
monitoring processes for financings, investments, and product development to identify, mitigate and
manage potential salient adverse human rights risks.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 89
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Performance
NIBC publishes indicators in this Annual Report that include the Non-Financial Key Figures which are
published at the beginning of this report. Additional figures are published in relevant sections
throughout this report. For example, human resource indicators are published in the Our People
chapter, Executive Remuneration is reported in the Remuneration Chapter. Sustainability
performance indicators such as NIBC’s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reported in our Sustainability
Report. Additional information across a range of environmental, social and governance aspects is also
included in that report.
Further disclosures are published in the Sustainability section of our website. Our GRI Content Index
provides a structure framework and guide to help stakeholders to find relevant sustainability content
across our many disclosures. NIBC’s 2019 capital markets updates, led by NIBC’s ExCo and business
unit heads, provided insights into our sustainability performance to institutional investors, retail
investors, rating agencies and clients.
No severe adverse human rights incidents related to NIBC’s financings, own operations, and supply
chain were reported in 2019. The main salient human rights risks for NIBC are labour conditions and
worker safety in corporate client supply chains. NIBC manages these risks through stakeholder
engagement, client and transaction due diligence and by raising awareness with corporate clients. Full
transparency into supply chains is an ongoing challenge for mid-market corporate businesses but is
gradually improving.
During 2019, no severe adverse environmental incidents related to NIBC’s financings, own operations
or supply chain were reported. At the same time, we recognise that physical and transitional climate
risks are present and impacts will continue to become more visible in future years.
We manage our direct impact on the environment through an environmental management
programme. One-hundred percent of electricity used in NIBC's facilities is sourced from renewable
energy, achieving our target Renovations completed in past years at our headquarters in The Hague
delivered increased efficiency and reduced energy-related carbon emissions. This is contributing to
our goal of reducing our direct emissions and is visible in the performance indicators reported in our
Sustainability Report. Our geothermal system in our Hague office allows NIBC to heat and cool using
water, thereby reducing our reliance on gas from fossil fuels and improving our energy efficiency.
Access to certain energy efficiency and emissions data is a constraint for NIBC and peer financial
institutions. Most existing sources available to financial institutions for their financed portfolios are
estimates. We will continue to encourage providers to improve public access to detailed data in
order to further develop our insights. New reported standards are regularly proposed, a signal that
existing sustainability accounting and reporting methodologies will continue to evolve over the
coming years.
Stakeholder engagement and materiality
NIBC recognises our responsibilities towards stakeholders, regularly engages with them and considers
their interests in our day-to-day decisions and activities. Engaging with stakeholders in a proactive way
and on a continuous basis is central to our strategy and ambition to achieve sustainable growth.
We define stakeholders as any group or individual affected directly or indirectly by our activities. We
have identified our main stakeholders to include clients, institutional investors, shareholders,
regulators, employees and civil society organisations. We actively seek these connections to the world
around us to ensure we reflect on our business, understand our impact and to continue to innovate .
90 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Our engagement with these groups takes place via different channels that range from ongoing
dialogue to direct requests for feedback. To ensure our long-term success, we acknowledge the need
to strike a careful balance between the interests of all our stakeholders.
The views of NIBC’s stakeholders are continuing to evolve, influenced by the world around us. There
is a rising expectation that financial and non-financial aspects need to be in balance. At the same
time, our stakeholders expect NIBC first and foremost to be a financially healthy company with
strong risk management which protects the integrity of the financial system. They also expect that we
strongly consider environmental concerns, human rights risks and good governance in our own
operations and in our financings and investments.
Materiality analysis 2019
The analysis was conducted in preparation of this report and the results are compiled and reported
visually in this chapter. For 2019, our stakeholder consultation was performed across a range of
stakeholder groups representing our clients, investors, regulators, civil society and employees. Based
on their input, we compiled and ranked each material topic on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = least
important; 10 = most important).

IMPACT OF NIBC
Themes:  Client Focus Culture & integrity The world around us
We used this opportunity to ask for more specific feedback in regard to diverse issues such as
financial results, climate risk, ethics, diversity, data privacy and others. They were also invited to add
material topics of their own. The location of each topic within the graph represents the sum of their
responses.
The four most material aspects for stakeholders were financial performance, client satisfaction,
climate change and product responsibility.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 91
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Financial performance was of high importance to our stakeholders. The financial landscape is changing
rapidly, influenced by low interest rates, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the emergence of fintechs.
Stakeholders have expressed the importance that they place on NIBC focusing on its financial targets,
maintaining its cost efficiency, building financial resilience and delivering on its promises. Our financial
performance and indicators are reported in the Key Figures of this Annual Report.
Client satisfaction was seen by stakeholders as very material. They believe that high client satisfaction
is an indicator of the strength of our franchise. The primary measurements of client satisfaction used
by NIBC are NPS score for corporate banking and the client satisfaction survey results for NIBC
Direct. We also closely monitor feedback received across all communication channels. During 2019,
our Non-Financial Key Figures in this Annual Report show that client satisfaction decreased slightly.
We believe that this may have been in part related to the intensity of KYC and related due diligence
activities.
Climate change increased in importance to our stakeholders during 2019. External keyholders and
NIBC employees alike signalled increased concerns about climate change and its impacts. They
appreciated NIBC’s efforts in reducing its fossil fuel exposure and see NIBC as having a role in
influencing corporate clients to adapt to the energy transition. During 2019 regulators formalised and
expressed their view of climate risks as financial risks. A number of employees mentioned
sustainability as a reason that they want to work at NIBC. This is reflected in the results of our
Employee Engagement survey reported in the Our People section of this Report. NIBC reports
indicators regarding its emissions, energy efficiency and environmental performance in its
Sustainability Report.
Product responsibility and ethical conduct continued to be very important. Stakeholders view this as
an areas of strength for NIBC. Our retail clients expressed appreciation for our online platform and
clear terms and conditions. Investors liked NIBC’s transparency , willingness to strengthen ESG
standards and open the leveraged loan market for increased responsible investment. We recognise
that the boundary for product responsibility is broad. It is closely connected with our code of
conduct and duty of care towards clients. For example, our retail savings clients expect a safe online
environment. All customers expect clear, understandable, and fair term and conditions. Retail and
corporate clients expect privacy and protection of their information. NIBC reports the percentage of
corporate loans screened for ESG and significant fines and sanctions as Non-Financial Key Figures in
this Annual Report.
Information security and data privacy remained important to stakeholders. Our stakeholders have
high awareness of data protection regulations such as GDPR. Statements on NIBC’s website provide
clarity to our customers. Within the Risk Management section of this Annual Report, we report on
our efforts to manage these risks and the results.
Stakeholders also mentioned the importance of diversity. They appreciated NIBC's efforts to take
action on diversity and improve gender equality. Having a diversity committee to oversee progress
within the company, focus on improving gender equality, and improved diversity in senior
management and in our Supervisory Board is seen as tangible and meaningful. During 2019, our
Non-Financial Key Figures in this Annual Report show that gender diversity at NIBC modestly
improved, continuing the progress made over the past few years. Additional indicators are disclosed
in our Sustainability Report.
92 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Examples of stakeholder engagement
North Westerly VI CLO
With institutional investors, we discussed financial, environmental and social objectives and shared
value creation. One result of these discussions was the North Westerly VI CLO which NIBC
launched in November. The emphasis on ESG and our approach on applying sustainability in the
development of the CLO was guided by input from both investors and civil society organisations.
During its launch in November, North Westerly VI was widely praised for pushing the envelope in
regard to sustainability and opening the CLO asset class for responsible investment.
Equator Principles
NIBC is one of 101 financial institutions in 38 countries worldwide which have officially adopted the
Equator Principles (EPs). The EPs are a risk management framework for determining, assessing and
managing environmental and human rights risks in project finance transactions. The development and
ratification process for Equator Principles 4 (EP4) attracted high interest from civil society
stakeholders, trade unions, national authorities and peer banks. Based on these engagements, NIBC
advocated within the EPA to strengthen standards and more closely align with the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights, OECD Guidelines for MNEs, and the targets of the Paris
Climate Agreement.
IRBC agreement for the Dutch banking sector
NIBC continued its commitment towards the International Responsible Business Conduct (IRBC)
agreement for the Dutch banking sector. The initiative aimed to improve human rights practices
related to project and corporate financings. During 2019, NIBC added language in its human rights
policy to help ensure lawful activities of human rights defenders are well protected. We used the
IRBC platform to share knowledge and engage with civil society organisations, authorities, clients, and
financial sector peers. NIBC actively participated in working groups focused on knowledge sharing
and enabling effective grievance and remedy mechanisms.
We engaged on human rights with business partners, clients, civil society organisations and
employees. Attention was given to increasing transparency of corporate human rights commitments
and practices with a view towards influencing long-term positive improvements. NIBC’s commitment
toward the IRBC Agreement and our Modern Slavery Statement were signed by members of our
managing board.
Climate Accord
NIBC discussed carbon emissions targets, potential climate risks, and best practices in reporting with
regulators, civil society organisations, peer banks and clients. NIBC’s CEO engaged in these
discussions and signed the Climate Accord alongside his peers from other Dutch financial institutions.
We also joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to further engage on
emerging carbon accounting standards in the financial sector with our financial peers. This will also
help to inform NIBC's own disclosures.
Responsible Shipping
NIBC continued to take a proactive role in addressing environmental and human rights issues in
shipping value chains.
During 2019, we met with representatives of local trade unions from India and Bangladesh to listen to
their views on priority areas in regard to human rights and environmental practices at shipbreaking
yards. We met with civil society organisations to discuss access to yards and the challenges faced by
human rights defenders. Separately we also met with inspectors of yards from Alang, India to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 93
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
encourage higher standards, increased cooperation with trade unions and improved access for civil
society organisations. Based on these sessions, we can conclude that the efforts of NIBC and the nine
other banks involved in RSRS are having a positive influence on the shipping value chain.
Since 2014, 100% of NIBC's new financings in shipping have included Responsible Ship Recycling
Standards (RSRS), achieving our target. It is a significant achievement more than 90% of NIBC’s
shipping portfolio at year-end 2019 includes RSRS commitments.
NIBC’s Value Chain
NIBC’s 2019 Annual Report mainly contains information on most topics which are material to our
stakeholders. As part of this process, we have evaluated NIBC’s value chain, assessing the different
areas of the value we create and the capital we control. This is done not only in terms of our
products and services to our clients, but also in terms of the value we deliver to those who invest in
us and provide funding.
We have encapsulated the results into a ‘value flow’ diagram which provides clarity into our value
creation model. While a simplified view, it reflects our client-first business agenda and our business
principles which will enable our future financial and non-financial performance.

Our value creation model reflects the capitals of the Integrated Reporting Council. Materiality is used
as a basic principle for reporting of the activities and impacts within our value chain. We operate in a
services sector, therefore manufactured capital (i.e. buildings and other physical assets) and natural
capital (natural resources as an input to our work) have less material relevance than they do in other
sectors.
We create value by transforming capital inputs. These inputs include the professionalism and
inventiveness (intellectual capital) of the people within NIBC, financial capital from investors and
savings from retail customers, and services provided by our suppliers and outsourcing partners. We
transform these inputs into value outputs so that they positively contribute to the resilient
communities that we serve while staying within ecological limits.
A core societal benefit is that this capital is invested back into communities that we serve – directly to
mid-sized family owned businesses in north-west Europe, the mortgages of retail customers and to
SMEs through our fintech partnerships. This helps to contribute to financial resilience at different
levels throughout these communities while delivering a good financial return for our investors.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 95
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Business Partners
NIBC’s strategic business partners and suppliers are largely professional services organisations
providing legal, audit, communications, technology, and other specialised services. These partners help
NIBC to serve the needs of our stakeholders.
Technology services are provided by Cegeka. Our mortgage business back office is outsourced to
Stater. Independent mortgage brokers are used in the origination of mortgages. Professional services
are provided by parties such as EY which provides auditing services and KPMG which provides
consultancy services. Cerrix provides a SAAS solution for operational risk management. During 2019
a partnership agreement was announced with Hutten to provide healthy, responsibly sourced
catering services at NIBC’s facilities in the Hague. Further business partners include Sopra, Fiducia,
and Collectric among others. Our partners vary in size, but each provides their services from
operating locations based in the same countries as NIBC.
Community Engagement
NIBC employees were active in a wide range of initiatives in our communities during 2019. In March,
NIBC employees again conducted financial education classes during the Week van het Geld (Global
Money Week), an initiative whereby bankers provide fun lessons about money to primary school
children. Approximately 700 primary school children participated in this Bank voor de Klas
programme with NIBC staff. ExCo members have represented us at the launching ceremeny and
been among those from NIBC who have led classes with the children.
We donated food and dozens of NIBC employees packed holiday food parcels to support families
which rely on the Dutch Foodbanks. Together with employees of other leading corporates such as
Unilever, Mars, Shell, Dr Oetker and Upfield, a total of 35,136 holiday food parcels were prepared
and distributed across the Netherlands.
In December, employees in The Hague supported Stichting Vitalis in what has become an annual
holiday tradition at the bank. Vitalis is a professional non-profit organisation that supports vulnerable
children so they can avoid intensive professional youth counselling programmes. NIBC employees
provided personalised holiday gifts for about 150 children in a special Christmas event.
NIBC NGO Boulevard
In 2015, we launched the NIBC NGO Boulevard, a unique initiative that makes modern office space
and professional facilities available to good causes. Civil society organisations in the NIBC NGO
Boulevard include Maatschappelijke Alliantie, Missing Chapter, Stichting Vitalis, SDG Charter and
Buddy Network. One focus area for all of these organisations and NIBC has been to contribute to
Dutch efforts towards the SDGs through activities and initiatives. Our daily interactions, joint
initiatives and workshops, and other activities have significantly increased awareness at NIBC staff of
human rights and environmental risks and impacts.
In March 2019, NIBC hosted the launch of Alliantie Kinderarmoede Nederland (Alliance to end child
poverty Netherlands) with Missing Chapter and Nederlands Centrum Jeugdgezondheid at our offices
in the Hague. Our CFO spoke to the importance of reducing the risks to children and the
importance of NIBC’s commitment to human rights. The initiative aims to end child poverty in the
Netherlands by 2030.
Throughout 2019, NIBC had the benefit of being inspired by these organisations since they share the
same facilities with us. inspire us and help raise the awareness amongst NIBC's employees of societal
challenges. Interaction with these civil society organisations has led to several joint initiatives on

Recent developments
NIBC operates in an environment that is characterised by continuous change. This section highlights
several developments and the relevance for NIBC's operations.
Conditional agreement on public offer parent company NIBC Holding N.V.
On 25 February 2020, NIBC Holding N.V. and The Blackstone Group International Partners LLP
(together with its affiliates, as the context requires, 'Blackstone') announced that an entity owned by
Blackstone, have reached a conditional agreement on a recommended all-cash public offer for all
issued and outstanding shares in the capital of NIBC Holding N.V., not held by J.C. Flowers & Co (JCF)
and Reggeborgh Invest B.V. (Reggeborgh) at an offer price of EUR 9.85 (cum dividend) per share in
cash.
The Offer is supported by NIBC Holding’s two largest shareholders, JCF and Reggeborgh,
representing 60.6% and 14.7% of the Shares respectively and 75.3% in aggregate. Each has irrevocably
agreed to sell their full shareholdings in NIBC Holding in separate private transactions with the
Offeror at fixed prices per Share (cum dividend) of EUR 8.93 per Share for JCF and EUR 9.65 per
Share for Reggeborgh, conditional upon the Offer being declared unconditional. All prices are
100 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
expressed cum dividend, including the final dividend for the 2019 financial year. The Managing Board
and Supervisory Board of NIBC Holding unanimously and thereby fully support the transaction and
recommend the offer for acceptance to the shareholders of NIBC Holding subject to completion of
the works council consultation procedure.
On 18 February, 2020 NIBC received inquiries from Vereniging van Effectenbezitters (VEB)
concerning NIBC Holding N.V.’s share price developments and associated trading volumes in relation
to the announced firm proposal from Blackstone on 14 February, 2020.
Intended merger NIBC Bank N.V. and NIBC Bank Deutchland AG
In 2014, NIBC acquired Gallinat Bank in Germany. Important driver for this acquisition was its full
membership with the einlagensicherungsfonds (ESF). This membership gave NIBC Bank Deutschland
AG access to the German deposits market for corporate clients and institutional investors. As per
January 2020 the terms and conditions of the ESF funding are changed. As a result the ESF funding no
longer meets the needs of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG adequately as this will be only short term
funding up to 18 months. As a result, a key reason for having NIBC Bank Deutschland AG as a
separate legal entity will disappear. NIBC is currently also looking into further simplifying its
organisation to be more agile and more flexible to adapt to the ongoing market challenges. A legal
merger between NIBC Bank N.V. and NIBC Bank Deutschland AG will decrease the regulatory
pressure and complexity of the organisation since the current regulatory requirements towards BaFin
will decrease substantially. For these reasons NIBC intends to merge NIBC Bank Deutschland AG into
NIBC Bank N.V..
EURIBOR-based mortgages
In 2017 NIBC acquired a portfolio of mortgages including a number of EURIBOR-based mortgages.
These types of mortgages are currently subject to individual and class action claims towards a
financial institution located in the Netherlands. Claimants have been contesting the contractual right
of the mortgage lender to unilaterally adjust the interest margin of the mortgage, and therefore
violating its duty of care towards the customer. The risks related to this legal issue were taken into
account at the time of acquisition of this mortgage portfolio and factored into the consideration paid.
Recently, the Supreme Court found in favour of the financial institution and referred the case back to
the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam. NIBC is monitoring the developments closely and has notified
the relevant clients that it will apply the outcome of these court proceedings to the EURIBOR-based
loans acquired by NIBC. Recently, a settlement has been agreed between the parties to that litigation.
NIBC is currently examining that settlement with a view to deciding next steps towards its own
affected clients, given such settlement and therefore absence of a final court outcome.
Brexit
With a branch office located in London and various activities carried out in the UK on a cross-border
basis from the Netherlands and Germany, NIBC is exposed to the continuing uncertainty surrounding
the future relationship between the UK and the EU. To the extent NIBC carries out regulated
activities in (and into) the UK, it does so on the basis of its Dutch and/or German licences, as
passported to the UK, and continues to do so during the implementation period which is due to run
until the end of 2020. NIBC has notified its regulators of its intention to enter into the UK’s
Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR), which regime acts as a backstop once the passporting regime
falls away at the end of the implementation period. By entering into the TPR, NIBC will be able to
continue operating in the UK within the scope of its current permissions after the end of the
implementation period, whilst seeking authorisation from the UK regulators to continue to do so in
the longer term. NIBC is in parallel making preparations to submit such authorisation application, and
is in dialogue with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and with the DNB in relation to such
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 101
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
matters. In addition, certain contractual and reporting arrangements have been reviewed and
amended and/or replaced, where necessary, to ensure continuity.
Brexit and the different potential outcomes of the negotiations due to take place between the UK
and the EU during the implementation period may negatively impact the macro economic climate in
Europe. The impact that this may have on our clients and consequently on NIBC's positions remains
difficult to assess.
Long-term value creation
With its purpose and strategic priorities in mind, NIBC is continuously evaluating its position within
the financial ecosystem and calibrating its short-term action plans with its long-term strategy. With
the direct interaction between the Managing Board and the Executive Committee, NIBC ensures the
connection between its strategy planning process and stakeholder engagement processes, so that the
interests of different stakeholders are actively included in the decision-making process. The choices
are translated into a 5-year strategic plan, including a capital and funding plan. This strategic plan also
takes the challenges the industry faces into account. The low-for-longer interest environment, the
increased regulatory demands and requirements related to our license to operate and permanently
changing demands from other stakeholders as well as adverse effects from a potential turn of the
cycle. This plan and the impact on NIBC going forward are extensively discussed in the Supervisory
Board. In the current environment, these processes have led to amongst others, a focus on actively
rebalancing our portfolios, the development of our OTM proposition, investments in Customer Due
Diligence (CDD) processes and procedures and various reporting processes.
With this approach, NIBC is actively steering on long-term value creation, to the benefit of all
stakeholders.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY
BOARD
The Supervisory Board is pleased with the strong performance over the year 2019, with the
management consistently meeting or exceeding medium term objectives. It was also NIBC’s first full
financial year as listed company. NIBC continued its strategy of a focused approach to selected
market niches in the dynamic mid-sized segment. Hereby NIBC further strengthened its franchise and
expanded its offering to clients. NIBC's profit after tax attributable to the shareholder amounted
EUR 190 million (2018: EUR 229 million). Excluding non-recurring items the profit improved from
EUR 181 million to EUR 197 million.
Although management recognises a number of challenges for the future (the low-interest
environment, (adverse) late-cycle trends and increasing requirements related to our licence to
operate), the Supervisory Board notes, at the same time, with satisfaction that NIBC continues to
prove it has the agility to continuously reinvent and adapt itself. The rebalancing of the Corporate
Loan portfolios that started in 2018 continued in 2019, resulting in de-risking of the balance sheet
and freeing up capital for new initiatives. Also the strong growth of the Originate-to-Manage
mortgages in the retail offering continued in 2019. The partnership with OakNorth was a major
milestone in 2019.
Our most important stakeholder, the customer, continues to value our efforts to serve his or her
interests. Due to increased attention for corporate loan Client Due Diligence and Know Your
Customer documentation, which by some clients was perceived as bureaucratic and an administrative
burden, this year’s NPS for corporate clients decreased to 47% (2018: + 63%). Our NIBC Direct
Customer Survey was 7.9 in 2019 (2018: 7.7). The success of a mid-sized niche market bank and
retail offering like NIBC stands or falls with an excellent customer experience. Therefore, the
Supervisory Board pays close attention to these metrics.
Corporate client offering
Initially a lending house for mostly medium-sized family businesses, NIBC corporate client offering has
transformed into a broad range, mid-market bank that is equipped to deliver on the entire credit side
of the client's balance sheet. NIBC's corporate client offering primarily achieves this by leveraging its
expertise in key (sub)sectors where it can add the greatest value through its tailored solutions and
services. NIBC's corporate client offering continued its gradual shift in client groups, with a strong
focus on building more granular portfolios e.g. in receivable finance and leasing. It focuses on mid-
sized and often family-owned companies in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Due to the
growing product range it increasingly attracts other highly relevant client groups: private equity funds
and parties, institutional investors, financial sponsors and large corporate clients. The origination and
refinancing volumes of EUR 3.0 billion were a bit lower than last year (2018: EUR 3.7 billion) as a
result of conscious decisions not to pursue opportunities in selected portfolios. Additionally a large
internal effort has been made to successfully complete KYC/CDD related projects.
Influenced by the changing market environment it was announced in January 2020 that NIBC had
decided to discontinue its capital markets activities (i.e. Fixed Income, DCM and ECM). Within
corporate client offering further streamlining is envisaged by centralising all portfolio management
activities. In the course of 2020 a merger between NIBC Bank Deutschland AG and NIBC Bank NV
should lead to further efficiency and a decrease in regulatory burden.
Retail client offering
In 2019, total mortgage origination volume increased to EUR 3.7 billion (2018: EUR 3.4 billion), of
which EUR 2.0 billion relates to Originate-to-Manage. These Originate-to-Manage mortgage loans are
originated for institutional investors, among which AXA Investment Managers. We were able to
106 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
increase the mandates with AXA Investment Managers and other institutional investors to
EUR 6.5 billion as at end 2019. Consequently, retail client offering is strongly increasing its client base
as well as creating a new fee revenue stream. Total mortgage loans for own book increased by more
than 6% to EUR 9.8 billion. In 2019, the preparations were started for the launch of a new mortgage
label, Lot, which will originate mortgage loans for two new Dutch Originate-to-Manage partners.
On the savings side, the Supervisory Board is pleased that the franchise value of the NIBC Direct
brand continues to be strong.
Medium-term targets and dividend
The Supervisory Board is proud that NIBC also in 2019 delivered upon its promises to meet the
medium-term targets as set early 2018. The proposed total dividend of EUR 190 million, reflecting a
pay-out ratio of 100%.
Executive Committee
In 2019, the Executive Committee (ExCo) comprised the three Managing Board members together
with Saskia Hovers (Corporate clients Sustainability & Transformation), Michel Kant (Retail clients)
and Caroline Oosterbaan (Corporate clients Growth & Innovation).
The non-statutory members of the Executive Committee attended all regular meetings of the
Supervisory Board. Through these meetings, in addition to the regular informal contacts, the
Supervisory Board stays closely tuned with all developments throughout the focus areas of the
individual ExCo members.
As part of the annual evaluation of the Managing Board/ExCo, team building and further
strengthening team spirit were observed as attention points. Additional effort will be put into this
topic in 2020.
Composition of the Supervisory Board
Throughout the year, NIBC’s Supervisory Board has performed its duties towards the company’s
stakeholders, and had full access to all necessary information and company officers and staff
members. We would like to extend our gratitude to all relevant stakeholders for providing us this
information.
As at 31 December 2019, the Supervisory Board comprised two female and five male members of
various nationalities. Four members are independent members that meet the independence criteria
laid out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The other three are representatives of NIBC's
majority shareholder.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Changes in 2019
Mr. W.M. van den Goorbergh stepped down as chair of NIBC’s Supervisory Board at the Annual
General Meeting of 26 April 2019. Mr. W.M. van den Goorbergh has been member of NIBC’s
Supervisory Board for 14 years of which 9 years as Chair. The Managing Board is grateful to Mr. W.M.
van den Goorbergh and all he has done for NIBC over the past 14 years. With his calm and
conscientious leadership of the Supervisory Board, he reconciled the interests of NIBC’s
shareholders, clients and employees - also in challenging times. He never hesitated to share his views
and advice and NIBC benefitted from his longstanding experience in banking and in corporate
governance. The Supervisory Board and the company are very thankful for his tremendous
contribution.
Mr. M.J. Christner was reappointed in April 2019 by the AGM for two years.
Mr J.J.M. Kremers was appointed to the NIBC Supervisory Board by the Extraordinary General
Meeting of Shareholders held on 29 August 2019. Mr. J.J.M. Kremers became chair of the Audit
Committee as well as member of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC) and the
Remuneration and Nominating Committee (RNC).
Diversity and succession
Based on the succession planning as performed in 2018, the Remuneration and Nominating
Committee of the Supervisory Board discussed succession planning for the near future in two of its
meetings in 2019. The Supervisory Board is pleased with its current composition and that of its
committees, as changes always bring new perspectives and the changes in 2019 contributed to
diversity especially in terms of skills. In the case of a vacancy, the regular policy is applied in which an
Executive Search firm is asked to provide a shortlist with at least 50% female candidates, although
final selection is ultimately based on the suitability for a specific position.
Additional functions
All members of the Supervisory Board meet the criteria of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
relating to other positions, insofar as they are relevant to the performance of the Supervisory Board
member’s duties.
Since the Dutch Act on Management and Supervision came into force on 1 January 2013, we have
been monitoring the number of supervisory functions held by our Supervisory Board members. The
profile for the Supervisory Board and their relevant ancillary positions can be found at the end of this
chapter and on our website. 
Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board met on seven regular occasions in 2019. This included three regular two-day
meetings in February, August and November and two regular one-day meetings in June and
December. An additional one-day meeting in June was held at which the Supervisory Board and the
Executive Committee discussed NIBC’s current and future strategy, and the way the company can
meet its objectives in order to provide long-term value creation for all stakeholders. All members of
the Supervisory Board participated in all regular meetings in 2019.

1 Number of meetings.
Six additional calls were held during the year. Topics of these additional calls included the internal
model investigation (IMI) by DNB, the increase in RWAs for our corporate loan portfolio.
Furthermore the strategic direction of NIBC in general was discussed as well as more specifically the
recent discussion with the Blackstone Group. Four members were absent from one of the additional
calls held during the year, and one call was among the independent members of the Supervisory
Board only.
The members of the Managing Board attended all regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, except
for one member who was absent during one meeting. Additionally, two members of the Supervisory
Board attended two consultation meetings between the Chief Executive Officer and the Works
Council. The SB members nominated by the Works Council had three additional informal meetings
with the Works Council without management being present.
During the meetings held in 2019 the Supervisory Board paid special attention to the strategic
direction of the bank for the coming five years, also taking into account the period as from 2022,
when the Basel IV regulation will start to be phased in. The focus in this five year business plan is on
freeing up capital and deploying that for new initiatives thereby creating long-term value for all
stakeholders.
In addition discussions took place on different (strategic) topics such as the Corporate and Retail
client offering, risk management, the IT Move project, the capital and funding plan, remuneration and
the increased regulatory requirements, also in relation to Know Your Customer, the impact of the IMI
by DNB and the follow-up actions and reporting. The 2019 quarterly and interim results were
discussed as well as the proposed dividend pay-out and the budget for 2020.
The Supervisory Board also continued its permanent education (PE) programme. Specific attention
was given to the current legal framework and expected future developments in Anti-Money
Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Attention was paid to the impact of the internal model
investigation on the Risk Weighted Assets of NIBC and the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board
and Managing Board in a potential change of ownership situation.
On 5 March 2019, J.C. Flowers & Company decided to float an additional approximately 13% of its
share in the parent company, NIBC Holding N.V., in an accelerated book building. This was a
standalone decision made by the majority shareholder of NIBC Holding N.V..
Apart from the mentioned transaction, there were no transactions in the year in which the members
of the Supervisory Board had a conflict of interest.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 109
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The financial statements and the findings of the external auditor were discussed in the external
auditor’s presence.
The four Supervisory Board committees
Most of the discussions and decisions of the Supervisory Board were prepared in the four
committees referred to below. The committees of the Supervisory Board each have an independent
chair.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee (AC) assists the Supervisory Board in monitoring NIBC’s systems of financial
risk management and internal control, the integrity of its financial reporting process and the content
of its annual and semi-annual financial statements and reports. The AC also advises on corporate
governance and internal governance.
The AC met on four regular occasions in 2019 (February, June, August and November) in presence
of the Managing Board. in January 2019, an additional meeting was held in which the Management
Letter 2018 was discussed. By mutual agreement the external auditor was present at all meetings of
the AC in 2019. The AC held a private meeting with the external auditor without the members of
the Managing Board being present.
The chairman of the AC prepared the meetings in advance by having meetings and calls with NIBC’s
CFO, the head of Finance and the head of Internal Audit as well as with the external auditor. In
between meetings, NIBC also actively shared relevant information with the chairman.
In 2019, the AC extensively reviewed NIBC’s quarterly financial highlights, interim and annual financial
reports and relevant press releases. It discussed the draft reports of the external auditor, including its
Audit Results Report, Audit Planning and Management Letter, before the reports were discussed in
the Supervisory Board meeting.
The AC had in depth discussions about NIBC’s financial performance, including the development of
the bank’s net profit, business growth and the development of spreads and cost/income ratio.
Furthermore, the AC reviewed NIBC’s capital and funding profile, and the development of related
solvency and liquidity ratios. The AC was informed specifically on the retransition of the IT
infrastructure and the related IT governance. Next to this, the AC received updates on project Care,
which focused on improving corporate loan Client Due Diligence and Know Your Customer.
Specific topics discussed with the auditor dealt with loan loss provisioning, NIBC’s change agenda,
new developments and their impact on financial figures and key control testing. The status of the IT
transition (IT Move) was discussed during all AC meetings. The Management Letter 2019 was
discussed in the November meeting. Main topics in the Management Letter are the IT environment
including the transition to a new external provider, the current state of the IT-landscape with respect
to access management and the internal control environment, governance on outsourcing
arrangements and key control testing. Also compliance was mentioned in the Management Letter
where anti-money laundering and customer due diligence are the main areas. Furthermore model
governance and validation were discussed.
Next to the regular topics mentioned before, the AC also discussed and has taken notice of
management views and arguments on the deferred tax position, budget 2020, forecast and capital
plan 2019-2022, dividend policy and the main topics discussed in the Disclosure Committee. The
external auditor also reported on its independence towards the AC which was further discussed by
110 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
the AC. The AC annually assesses NIBC’s compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
and reports thereon towards the Supervisory Board.
The AC took note of and discussed NIBC’s consultations with DNB. As part of the yearly cycle, the
AC discussed the main observations made by DNB in its annual SREP letter and the impact on the
business/capital positions of the bank. The AC considered the on-site examinations conducted by
DNB, including the onsite inspections of NIBC’s Corporate Probability on Default Model and NIBC’s
Internal Governance and Risk Management.
The AC discussed the annual plan and quarterly reports of Internal Audit, and evaluated the
functioning of Internal Audit. The AC specifically took note of the (timely remediation of) Measures
of Improvement, reported by DNB, the external auditor and internal audit. Both the internal and
external auditor reported on the quality and effectiveness of governance, internal control and risk
management.
Risk Policy & Compliance Committee
The Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC) assists the Supervisory Board in overseeing NIBC’s
risk appetite, risk profile and risk policy. It prepares matters in these areas for decision in the
Supervisory Board by presenting proposals and recommendations on credit, market, investment,
liquidity, operational and compliance/regulatory risks, and any other material (non-) financial risks to
which NIBC is exposed. The RPCC met four times in 2019 in the presence of the members of the
Managing Board.
During 2019, the RPCC extensively discussed NIBC’s assets, liquidity and funding, stress tests and risk
profile. The increasing regulatory demands including market sentiment and onsite investigations by
regulators were frequent topics on the agenda of the RPCC where NIBC’s customers, associated
regulatory requirements and the ways that NIBC control the potential risks remained important
themes.
In 2019, non-financial risks such as Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering were very
prominent and in the second half of the year the DNB Internal Model Investigation results and
remediation planning were thoroughly discussed. The RPCC continued to focus on the operational
risk profile and in-control environment, including, amongst others, specific risks such as information
security, new product approvals, compliance and regulatory risk. The committee also reviewed the
risk assessments of new business initiatives, evaluated how risk awareness is embedded in NIBC’s
organisation, as well as its own functioning.
NIBC’s long-term objectives, including the attainment and retention of a BBB+ credit rating which
was received in May 2019 as well as updates to the risk appetite framework, involving new metrics
and revised limits, remained on the agenda. Strategic planning, including the reduction of certain
portfolios was a recurring subject, as was the potential Basel IV impact.
Besides risk appetite and the quarterly reporting on the subjects received by the committee, the
RPCC discussed in all of its meetings segments of NIBC’s corporate and retail credit portfolios,
including appropriate risk measurement parameters for portfolio performance, the bank’s distressed
portfolio, as well as specific distressed exposures. Other topics the RPCC regularly reviewed included
NIBC’s market risk reports, liquidity risk reports and risks of the macroeconomic environment, such
as the availability of foreign currency funding and the impact of Brexit.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 111
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Further, on the non-financial risk side, the RPCC reviewed NIBC’s franchise as reflected in the
experience of its customers, the relation with the regulators, the views of the rating agencies and
regularly reviewed and discussed regulatory, societal and market developments and their impact on
NIBC, such as systematic integrity risk analysis, Basel IV, sustainability, block chain, Euribor residential
mortgage loans and interbank benchmarks.
The RPCC paid attention to the ongoing examinations at financial institutions in general concerning
systemic integrity risks as well as the SIRA on-site follow-up, the IMI follow-up and the DNB onsite on
Governance & Risk Management. The RPCC is also actively discussing the implementation of relevant
laws and regulations such as GDPR.
Remuneration and Nominating Committee
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee (RNC) advises the Supervisory Board on the
remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board and certain other
senior managers. In addition, it provides the Supervisory Board with proposals for appointments and
reappointments to the Supervisory Board, its committees and the Managing Board. In April 2019, Mr.
W.M. van den Goorbergh, member of the RNC, resigned at the end of his term. Mr. J.J.M. Kremers
was appointed in August 2019 as member of the Supervisory Board and chair of the AC.
The RNC also assesses the performance of the members of the Managing Board and the Supervisory
Board and has at least annual meetings with the individual MB members on their performance and
team work. Please refer to the Remuneration Report for further detail.
The RNC monitors the remuneration policy as well as the execution of it, which entails discussing the
total available pool for variable compensation and defining the collective and individual performance
targets that form the basis for the variable compensation of individual members of the Managing
Board. Furthermore, the committee oversees the remuneration of the so-called Identified Staff
employees whose professional activities have a material impact on NIBC’s risk profile and determines
the remuneration of the control functions.
In 2019, the RNC held five regular meetings, all in the presence of NIBC’s head of Human Resources
and, in appropriate cases, of NIBC’s CEO. Additionally, the chair, on behalf of the RNC, attended a
meeting of the control functions.
The RNC discussed the regular subjects regarding remuneration, risk and audit assessments,
governance and variable income as well as the suitability policy and, based on the evaluation of the
composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees the requirements for the Supervisory
Board and its committees.
In 2019, it was concluded in the yearly self-assessment that the SB members are satisfied with the
functioning of the SB. Points of attention are succession planning, the organisation and culture and
permanent education. To follow up on these attention points it was decided that minutes of all
committee meetings will be actively shared with all SB members whilst the SB members also have a
standing invitation to attend the committee meetings and that for permanent education an annual
calendar will be set up.
The chair of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee prepared the meetings of the RNC in
advance by having meetings/calls with the head of Human Resources and where appropriate the
CEO.
112 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Remuneration management
The RNC reviewed the Remuneration Policy this year, taking into account relevant legislation and
guidelines, amongst others, the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on sound remuneration
policies. Besides legislation, the RNC has taken market circumstances and developments into
consideration. The positioning of NIBC in relevant labour markets was monitored by means of
benchmark surveys. Attention was also paid to broader developments in society, as the RNC is well
aware of public concerns about remuneration in the financial industry. The Supervisory Board
amended the remuneration policy, fulfilling all legislative changes as proposed by the RNC. The RNC
also discussed the performance of the Managing Board, the Executive Committee and its members
and set financial and non-financial targets.
Given the importance of the subject, the RNC extensively discussed the overall available funding for
variable compensation and determined the proposed distribution to Identified Staff. In this respect,
the risk assessments (including malus and clawback assessments) were discussed and taken into
account in the decision making. The surrounding governance and the developments in the area of
governance and legislation were explicitly discussed in the RNC, given the sensibility of the subject of
remuneration. The Committee also determined the obligatory disclosures on the Identified Staff and
on the remuneration policy.
In line with the Remuneration Policy the RNC received information for a hybrid benchmark peer
group reflecting the labour market of NIBC as well as a benchmark regarding post-employment
benefits. Given the specific circumstances and legislation for the (Dutch) financial institutions, more
specifically for banks, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee decided to also use a
benchmark of the Dutch banks.
Based on this information the Remuneration and Nominating Committee proposed to the
Supervisory Board to put a system in place that determines the annual adjustment of salaries of the
CEO and Members of the Managing Board. In the 2020 renewal of the Managing Board
remuneration policy this system will be included in the new proposed policy to the AGM.
For the Supervisory Board the new remuneration policy was put forward and adopted by the AGM
in 2019, including the (same as MB) methodology that determines the annual adjustment of the
annual fee of the members of the Supervisory Board.
In 2018, the RNC started discussions with regards to the abolishment of variable income for the
Managing Board and developed scenarios for conversion of a part of the variable income in the base
salary. These discussions were concluded in 2019. A proposal will be made to the AGM to abolish
variable income for the Managing Board as of 1 January 2020 and convert part of it into base salary;
the proposed approach is the same as that is used for the vast majority of eligible NIBC-employees in
the Netherlands.
In 2019, it was concluded in the yearly self assessment that the SB members are satisfied with the
functioning of the SB. Points of attention are succession planning, the organisation and culture and
permanent education. To follow up on this attention points it was decided that minutes of all
committee meetings will be actively shared with all SB members whilst the SB members also have a
standing invitation to attend the committee meetings and that for permanent education an annual
calendar will be set up.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The chair of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee prepared the meetings of the RNC in
advance by having meetings/calls with the head of Human Resources and where appropriate the
CEO.
Succession management
In its meetings the RNC has closely monitored management development and succession
management throughout the bank. The Committee’s chair held regular talks with senior managers to
gain a deeper understanding of their professional development and of internal developments taking
place within the bank.
The RNC also extensively discussed the succession management regarding the Supervisory Board.
On its proposal the Supervisory Board decided to nominate Mr. J.J.M. Kremers as member of the
Supervisory Board.
Related Party Transactions Committee
The Related Party Transactions Committee (RPTC) assists the Supervisory Board in assessing material
transactions of any kind with a person or group of persons who hold, directly or indirectly, at least
10% of NIBC’s issued and outstanding share capital, or at least 10% of the voting rights at the Annual
General Meeting of shareholders. The same applies to any person affiliated with any such person(s)
that meet(s) these criteria. A transaction will, in any event, be considered material if the amount
involved exceeds EUR 10 million and/or that is considered inside information. The Supervisory Board
has delegated the authority to approve such material transactions to the Related Party Transactions
Committee.
In two RPTC meetings held in September and October, the RPTC discussed and approved the
financing and M&A advisory transactions of Reggeborgh in the envisaged public offer for
VolkerWessels.

Financial statements
The company and consolidated financial statements have been drawn up by the Managing Board and
audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, who issued an unqualified opinion dated
25 February 2020. The Supervisory Board recommends that shareholders adopt the 2019 Financial
Statements at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 17 April 2020. The Supervisory Board
also recommends that the Annual General Meeting of shareholders discharge the Managing Board
and Supervisory Board for their respective management and supervision during the financial year
2019.
The Supervisory Board would like to express its gratitude to all stakeholders who helped to make
2019 the success it was, most notably to our over 700 highly professional, entrepreneurial and
inventive employees. Thanks to their skills, expertise, agility and dedication NIBC could achieve these
great results.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
At NIBC, we endeavour to maintain a sound, transparent and effective governance system that is
aligned to best practices in our industry. The Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Dutch Banking
Code form the base of our governance system and guide the way we work at NIBC.
This chapter contains some highlights of our governance structure in 2019. The structures and
processes we have developed provide an effective basis for making and implementing decisions across
our organisation, with its hierarchical and functional reporting lines.
Our website contains our articles of association, charters, relevant policies and other information on
corporate governance and the compliance statements with respect to the Dutch Banking Code and
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. To the extent applicable, NIBC also adheres to
international governance standards such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance.
Two-tier board structure
NIBC Bank N.V., has voluntarily adopted a two-tier board structure. It has been agreed in the charter
of the Supervisory Board that the composition of the Supervisory Board of NIBC Bank N.V. will be
identical to the composition of the Supervisory Board of parent company NIBC Holding N.V.
As a result, NIBC maintains a two-tier board structure consisting of a Managing Board and a
Supervisory Board. The Managing Board is responsible for the day-to-day management, which
includes, among other things, formulating NIBC’s strategy, policies and setting and achieving NIBC’s
objectives. The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Managing Board. It is the Board’s
priority to protect the interests of the company and all its stakeholders, rather than the interests of
any particular stakeholder.
Managing Board
In 2019, NIBC had three Managing Board members. These members have thorough and in-depth
knowledge of the financial sector in general and the banking sector in particular.
For the composition of the Managing Board as per 31 December 2019, refer to the following table:
Name Year of birth Nationality Member since End of term1
Mr. P.A.M. de Wilt (CEO, Chairman) 1964 Dutch 2014 2022
Mr. H.H.J. Dijkhuizen (CFO, Vice-Chairman) 1960 Dutch 2013 2021
Mr. R.D.J. van Riel (CRO) 1970 Dutch 2016 2020
1 These are the dates until which the appointment as statutory director runs. They do not refer to the expiry of employment contracts.
In case of a vacancy in the Managing Board, the regular policy is applied and the Executive Search
team is asked to provide a shortlist with at least 50% female candidates, although final selection is
ultimately based on the suitability for the position. At the level of the Executive Committee, NIBC
meets the diversity requirements (see below). NIBC will also continue to strive for a good gender
balance at Managing Board level.
Executive Committee
As at 1 January 2017 an Executive Committee was formed consisting of the three Managing Board
members and three non-statutory members representing commercial roles. The Executive
Committee consists of two female members and four male members. The Managing Board and the
Executive Committee, which meet weekly, represent and balance the interests of all stakeholders.
The non-statutory Executive Committee members participate in the discussions in meetings, but are
not entitled to a vote.
118 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In 2019, there were no transactions in which the members of the Managing Board or the members
of the Executive Committee had a conflict of interest. More information about the Managing Board
and the Executive Committee, including short biographies, can be found on our website.
Managing Board Germany
NIBC Bank Deutschland AG is a full subsidiary of NIBC Bank N.V. At 31 December 2019, the
Vorstand (Managing Board) of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG comprised Mr. V.C. Ruitenberg and
Mr. J.B. Spanjersberg. Mr. T.A. Rasser stepped down from the Vorstand as at August 2019 and
subsequently Mr. V.C. Ruitenberg was appointed CEO of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG. Members of
the Aufsichtsrat (Supervisory Board) of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG are Mr. H.H.J. Dijkhuizen,
Ms. S.M. Hovers and Mr. P. Zippro.
Supervisory Board
On 31 December 2019, the Supervisory Board of NIBC consisted of seven members with extensive
and international expertise in fields such as banking and finance, corporate governance and
corporate management.
On 26 April 2019, Mr. W.M. van den Goorbergh, the chair of the Supervisory Board, resigned from
NIBC’s Supervisory Board as per the end of his term. He was succeeded as at the same date by
Mr. D.M. Sluimers.
On 29 August 2019, Mr. J.J.M. Kremers was appointed as Supervisory Board member and chair of the
Audit Committee.
For more information on our Supervisory Board, including a complete list of all members and
Committees, please see the Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report or visit our
website.
Dutch Corporate Governance Code
NIBC supports and actively applies the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This
Code was revised in December 2016 and consequently implemented by NIBC.
NIBC partly deviates from one of the best practices and principles as laid out in the Code:
NIBC does not comply with best practice provision 2.1.7 (iii), which requires that there is at most
one supervisory board member who can be considered to be affiliated with a shareholder, or group
of affiliated shareholders, who holds more than 10% of the shares in a company. Four out of seven
members of NIBC’s Supervisory Board qualify as formally independent. The other three members
are formally not independent, because they are representatives of the major shareholder (61%) of
the parent company. This principle in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code deviates from the
policy of the Dutch central bank (DNB) that came into force in 2012. DNB’s policy is that at least
50% of the members of a Supervisory Board should be formally independent. NIBC complies with
the DNB policy.
Dutch Banking Code
The updated Dutch Banking Code came into effect as legislation on 1 January 2015, after a decree by
the Dutch Minister of Finance. The Banking Code is part of a package called ‘Future-oriented
banking’. In addition to the Banking Code, Future-oriented banking introduces a Social Charter and
rules of conduct associated with the Bankers’ Oath and disciplinary rules for employees of banks in
the Netherlands. Before 1 January 2015 the Dutch Banking Code was a form of self-regulation.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 119
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Dutch Banking Code, together with the introduction of the Social Charter and the
implementation of the Bankers' Oath, is applicable to all employees of financial institutions in the
Netherlands. NIBC supports the principles of the Banking Code to regain trust, ensure stability and
protect the interests of our stakeholders.
NIBC has implemented all procedural and operational measures required under the Dutch Banking
Code. Our governance is fully aligned with the Banking Code. We also aligned our remuneration
policies for staff and Managing Board with the Banking Code. Ever since the code came into effect,
we have been running a programme for lifelong learning and hold regular training sessions for the
Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, as is required by the Banking Code.
Among other things the Banking Code requires banks to operate in a sound and ethical way. Our
mission, strategy and objectives reflect this; they can be found on our website. Being in line with this
are the NIBC3, our three corporate values: professional, entrepreneurial and inventive. The NIBC3
are the foundation of all our company’s activities, including our products and services, as well as our
general performance, behaviour, attitude and the targets we set for our employees. Integrity is
considered an essential part of the core value 'professional'.
NIBC’s Code of Conduct guides us in the way we work at NIBC. Key themes are: doing the right
thing, following the letter and the spirit of rules and doing what we say. You can find the Code of
Conduct, including a one page abbreviation for daily use, on our website. 
A detailed explanation of the Dutch Banking Code and an overview of NIBC’s compliance with it can
be found on our website. 
Capital structure
NIBC Bank's authorised share capital amounts to 183,597,500 shares. On 31 December 2019, a total
of 62,586,794 ordinary shares were issued, all of them owned by the parent company, NIBC Holding.
120 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Supervisory Board reviewed and amended NIBC’s remuneration policy in 2019. The review took
into account all relevant laws, regulations and guidelines: the Dutch Corporate Governance Code; the
Dutch Banking Code; the DNB Principles on Sound Remuneration Policies (DNB principles), EBA
Guidelines on Sound Remuneration; and CRD IV and the Dutch remuneration legislation for financial
services companies (Wet beloningsbeleid financiële onderneming, Wbfo).
NIBC’s remuneration policy and Managing Board remuneration for 2019 are outlined in this chapter.
An overview of the remuneration of other staff and the Supervisory Board is also presented. Please
see our website for further information about the remuneration policy.
To avoid unnecessary duplication, we refer to notes 9 and 54 and of the Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Annual Report for all relevant tables. These are considered to be an integral part
of this Remuneration Report.
Remuneration principles
NIBC’s remuneration policy is sustainable, balanced and in line with our chosen strategy and risk
appetite. It revolves around these five key principles: remuneration is (i) aligned with NIBC’s business
strategy and risk appetite; (ii) appropriately balanced between short and long term; (iii) differentiated
and linked to the achievement of performance objectives and the results of NIBC; (iv) externally
competitive and internally fair; and (v) managed in an integrated manner that takes into account total
compensation.
Managing Board remuneration in 2019
In order to determine appropriate market levels of remuneration for the Managing Board, the
Supervisory Board has identified a hybrid benchmark peer group, consisting of all AEX and AMX
(both Euronext) listed companies. Given the specific circumstances and legislation for the (Dutch)
financial institutions, more specifically for banks, the Supervisory Board decided to also use a
benchmark of the Dutch banks. The composition of these peer groups reflects the labour market in
which NIBC competes for talent. As such, it is an objective measure not based on individual data
points selected by NIBC.
Throughout the cycle, total compensation for the CEO and members of the Managing Board is
targeted just below the median of their peers in the peer group, based on benchmark data provided
by external independent compensation consultants and publicly available information. The positioning
just below the median of the peer group is in line with the Dutch Banking Code.
Base salaries
In 2019, the base salary for the CEO was EUR 845,708 gross per year (2018: EUR 825.000). The
base salary for the two other members of the Managing Board was EUR 615,060 gross per year
(2018: EUR 600.000). Base salaries are paid in 12 equal monthly payments. The base salaries of the
CEO and the members of the Managing Board increased by 2.51%. This increase was based on the
three-year average merit increase for all employees within NIBC and is in line with the targeted
positioning.
Variable compensation
According to the remuneration policy, the variable income component in 2019 for the Managing
Board is set at 15% of base salary at target achievement with a maximum of 20% of the base salary.
Based on the medium-term objectives specific targets were set: financial targets 25% (profit,
operating income, expenses and impairments), business growth 25% (net growth and growth
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 121
REMUNERATION REPORT
agenda), Franchise People & Clients 15% (engagement, and NPS), Operational Control 25% (client
integrity) and personal target 10% (e.g. governance and stakeholder management).
The performance of the Managing Board was reviewed by the RNC in relation to the
accomplishment of the medium term objectives. The Supervisory Board used its discretionary power
to award the maximum variable compensation given the performance of the Managing Board on the
set targets (close to stretch level), on the one hand and achievements on the medium-term
objectives, on the other hand. Over 2019 the following incentive compensations of base salary were
granted: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 20%, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) 20% and Chief Risk Officer
(CRO) 20%.
For all members of the Managing Board this variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined mix:
30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in phantom share units (PSUs) and 20% in unvested PSUs. In
this way, NIBC complies with regulations (EBA/Wbfo) that require Identified Staff to receive 50% of
all variable compensation in the form of equity or equity-linked instruments and for at least 40% of
both the cash and equity component to be deferred. For the Managing Board, the holding period of
the equity-linked instruments is set to five years as required by the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code.
Retention package 2019 - Executive Committee
In 2019, in the preparation for the IPO various stakeholders (potential investors, selling shareholder
who also remained a shareholder, supervisory board, but also e.g. regulators) deemed retention of
the Executive Committee necessary, as the stakeholders would like to ensure stability at the highest
level before, during and after the IPO. The retention package was designed in such a way that those
interests are safeguarded and in line with applicable legislation and regulations. In the context of the
IPO the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) has given its consent to the award of the retention package
within the meaning of article 1:122 of the FMSA and in accordance with the procedure of article 94
(1)(g) under (ii) of CRD IV. Shareholders of NIBC approved the retention package. The retention
package consisted of two parts, the first (60%) subject to continued employment until the date of the
IPO (23 March 2018) and the second (40%) subject to continued employment until the first
anniversary of the IPO (23 March 2019). Both parts are subject to the rules on deferral and
retention (lock-up period). The retention packages for the Executive Committee amounted to 180%
of the annual base salary for the Members of the Managing Boards and to 165% of the annual base
salary for the non-statutory members of the Executive Committee, which is consistent with the
applicable legislation as mentioned above. The pay-out of the retention packages will be subject to
the regular requirements on pay-out to Identified Staff, hence an ex-post risk analysis will be
conducted prior to vesting and deferral will be applied, in line with RBB 2017 and the EBA guidelines.
Moreover a lock-up of five years, following the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, is applicable and
is also applied to the non-statutory members of the Executive Committee
Pension
The CEO and other Managing Board members participate in the NIBC pension plan, in line with the
arrangements available to all other employees. In 2019, the pension plan consisted of a) a collective
defined-contribution pension arrangement (CDC arrangement) up to a pensionable salary of
EUR 107,593 maximum salary, and; b) an additional (gross) contribution up to their respective base
salaries. The retirement age for the CEO and members of the Managing Board was 68 in 2019.
There are no contractual early retirement provisions.
For the CDC arrangement NIBC pays a standard flat-rate contribution of 26.2 % into the pension
fund (for the Managing Board as well as for all other employees). All employees are required to make
122 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REMUNERATION REPORT
a personal contribution of 4.2% of their pensionable salary in the CDC arrangement. The gross
contribution by NIBC for pensions above the fiscal maximum is set at 25%.
Other key benefits
The CEO and members of the Managing Board are entitled to a company car up to a certain price
limit or, if they prefer, the equivalent value of the lease car limit as a gross cash allowance. The CEO is
entitled to the use of a permanent chauffeur from the chauffeurs' pool whilst the other members of
the Managing Board are entitled to the use of a chauffeur from the pool for business purposes only
unless otherwise agreed by the Supervisory Board.
As is the case with all our employees, the members of the Managing Board are entitled to a
contribution towards their disability insurance, accident insurance and permanent travel insurance.
The total amount of remuneration per individual Board Member split out in the separate
components is shown below:
Variable Other key

R.D.J. van Riel 615,060 123,012 161,677 40,218 939,967
Employment contracts
The CEO and members of the Managing Board all have indefinite employment contracts, which are
fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Their appointment to the Managing
Board is for a maximum term of four years. The term can be renewed.
Any severance payment is limited to 12 months’ base salary and will not be awarded if the agreement
with the member of the Managing Board is terminated early at the initiative of the member of the
Managing Board, or in the event of seriously culpable or negligent behaviour on the part of the
member of the Managing Board.
Amendments in 2020
The Supervisory Board reviews the base salary level regularly and may decide to adjust it. In 2019,
the RNC of the Supervisory Board thoroughly reviewed the Managing Board remuneration. Hereby
it took into account all relevant benchmarks, such as the hybrid benchmark peer group in the
relevant environment for NIBC, as well as a benchmark regarding the post-employment benefits. The
benchmark of Dutch banks was also explicitly included in the assessment, in view of the recent
developments with regard to salary and variable income. Based on this information the Supervisory
Board will present to the Annual General Meeting two proposals. The first proposal is to confirm a
system that determines the annual adjustment of salaries on 1 January 2020 of the Members of the
Managing Board based on the three year average merit increase of all employees within NIBC, as has
been applied in 2019. Based on this methodology the annual adjustment of salaries on 1 January
2020 will be 2,83%.
The second proposal is to abolish Variable Income for the Members of the Managing Board and to
convert a part of this into the base salary. In order to take a pro-active approach to the increasing
regulatory and social pressure on variable composition it is proposed to convert the three-year
average bonus (2017-2019) for 68% into the base salary on 1 January 2020. The same conversion
rate also applies to the majority of the bonus eligible employees of NIBC in the Netherlands for
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 123
REMUNERATION REPORT
bonuses up to 20%. In line with the Banking Code the Supervisory Board performed a stakeholder
analysis with regard to the proposals.
Other staff remuneration
In line with the DNB Principles, employees whose professional activities have a material impact on
NIBC’s risk profile are designated Identified Staff. Specific remuneration conditions may apply to
Identified Staff (other than Managing Board members). The outlines of the remuneration policies for
Identified Staff and other staff are given below. For further details on the policies for Identified Staff,
please see our website.
Total compensation funding
Each year, based on a proposal by the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board decides, at its
discretion, on the overall amount of money available for total compensation, the amount of money
available for variable compensation and the specific forms in which variable compensation may be
awarded. The 2019 compensation ratio (total compensation costs as percentage of operating
income) was 21.8%.
Variable compensation
All employees with a function contract have a pre-agreed set of financial and non-financial (at least
50%) performance targets. Their performance assessments take into account the achievement of pre-
agreed targets, how they have behaved according to NIBC’s corporate values, as well as their
contributions towards the bank’s longer-term objectives. Non-financial performance aspects include
client satisfaction, employee satisfaction, transparency, and sustainability. The Dutch Banking Code
serves as a guideline for all employees.
Whether or not an employee actually receives a variable compensation for his or her performance, is
wholly discretionary and depends on the overall financial and non-financial performance of the bank,
of the respective business unit, personal performance and relevant market levels of remuneration.
Employees do not qualify for variable remuneration if their performance has been inadequate or
poor, if they have failed to meet duty-of-care or compliance requirements, if they have displayed
behaviour contrary to NIBC’s policies and corporate values, or if they were subject to disciplinary
action.
Both for the Managing Board and employees, the variable compensation, if any, is delivered in various
components:
1. cash;
2. deferred cash;
3. vested phantom share units;
4. unvested PSUs.
The Managing Board determines the precise split between cash and equity or equity-linked
components, the proportion of deferred compensation and the form in which this is distributed
(such as cash or unvested equity), whether a threshold applies for the deferred component and, if so,
how high that threshold is.
For Identified staff, no threshold applies and any variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined
mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in PSUs and 20% in unvested PSUs. In this way, NIBC
complies with regulations that require Identified Staff to receive 50% of all variable compensation in
the form of equity or equity-linked instruments and for at least 40% of both the cash and equity
component to be deferred.
124 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
REMUNERATION REPORT
For employees with a scale contract (in the Netherlands) it has been agreed upon with the Works
Council that they will receive a fixed amount of EUR 1,250 over 2019, which qualifies as variable
compensation.
Special situations
Only in exceptional cases and only in the first year of employment the Managing Board can offer sign-
on or guaranteed minimum bonuses to new employees as well as retention bonuses to existing
employees. In the unlikely event that these bonuses amount to more than 100% of the base salary of
the individual employee concerned, procedures will be followed in accordance with the regulations;
the maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration will be respected.
Any severance payment made, if NIBC terminates employment without cause, is subject to local
legislation. For the Netherlands, the prevailing business court guidelines (transition formula) and, in
the case of reorganisation, NIBC’s Social Protocol, are applicable. Special compensation plans for
specific groups of employees are subject to prior approval by the Managing Board, which annually
informs the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board about these
arrangements.
Supervisory Board remuneration in 2019
The Supervisory Board remuneration policy 2019 has been approved by the Annual General Meeting
in 2019. The new Supervisory Board remuneration policy has a system is in place that determines the
annual adjustment of fees on 1 January of a year for the Supervisory Board based on the three-year
average merit increase for all employees within NIBC. The increase on 1 January 2019 was 2.51%.
The chair of the Supervisory Board is entitled to an annual fee of EUR 76,883 (2018: EUR 75,000),
the vice-chair of the Supervisory Board is entitled to an annual fee of EUR 61,506 (2018:
EUR 60,000) and the other members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to an annual fee of
EUR 51,255 (2018: EUR 50,000).
In addition, all chairs of the AC, RPCC and RNC of the Supervisory Board are entitled to an annual
fee of EUR 15,377 (2018: 15,000). Members of the AC and members of the RPCC are entitled to an
annual fee of EUR 10,251 (2018: EUR 10,000). The members of the RNC are entitled to an annual
fee of EUR 7,688 (2018: EUR 7,500). The members of the RPTC are entitled to an annual fee of nil
(2018: nil). The 2018 Supervisory Board remuneration was equal to 2017.
All members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to reimbursement of genuine business expenses
incurred while fulfilling their duties.
Amendments Supervisory Remuneration in 2020
Based on the remuneration policy of the Supervisory Board the annual adjustment of fees as at
1 January 2020 is 2.83%.
Remuneration governance
In line with the various recommendations and guidelines issued by regulators, NIBC has strengthened
governance around the annual remuneration process and agreed upon key roles for the Human
Resources, Risk Management, Compliance, Audit and Finance functions (control functions).
The Supervisory Board discussed the performance and remuneration of Identified Staff, as well as the
performance and remuneration of control functions. The Supervisory Board also discussed the
highest proposed variable compensations in 2019. Scenario analyses were conducted by Risk
Management to assess the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components on an
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 125
REMUNERATION REPORT
individual and collective basis. The internal annual report 'Harrewijn' is discussed in the RNC as well
as with the Works Council. This report provides information on the composition and development
of compensation and benefits of its employees. Amongst others the report covers an internal pay
ratio analysis.
In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, NIBC discloses the relevant elements related to
the internal pay ratios. In 2019, the base salary pay ratio of the CEO (EUR 845,788) compared to the
base salary of a member of the Managing Board (EUR 615,060) was 1.4. In 2019, the base salary pay
ratio of the CEO and the Managing Board members (EUR 691,969) compared to the base salary of
the non-statutory members of the Executive committee (EUR 350,000) was 2.0. In 2019, the base
salary pay ratio of the CEO (EUR 845,788) compared to the median full-time base salary of all
employees (EUR 74.000) was 11.4 (2018: 10.6).
Adjustments
Any vested amounts of variable remuneration are subject to clawback by the Supervisory Board in
the event they have been based on inaccurate financial or other data, fraud, or when the employee in
question is dismissed ‘for cause’. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board has
the discretion to adjust downwards any or all variable remuneration if, in its opinion, this
remuneration could have unfair or unintended effects. In assessing performance against pre-agreed
performance criteria, financial performance shall be adjusted to allow for estimated risks and capital
costs. In addition to clawbacks, the concept of ‘malus’ is part of the remuneration policy. This is an
arrangement that permits NIBC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of deferred
compensation in relation to risk outcomes of performance. Malus is a form of ex-post risk
adjustment, one of the key requirements in addition to ex-ante risk adjustments.
If an employee resigns, any unvested amounts of compensation are forfeited.
Conclusion
The RNC and the Supervisory Board believe NIBC’s remuneration policy responsibly links
performance and reward and is compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. The
Supervisory Board continues to believe in prudent management of remuneration whilst recognising
that NIBC operates in a competitive market place where it needs to be able to attract, motivate and
retain sufficient talent.
NIBC is determined to make a positive contribution towards fair compensation practices in the
banking sector in consultation with its stakeholders. Furthermore, we aim to create the level playing
field that regulators envisage with regard to variable compensation.
Disclosure on Dutch remuneration legislation for financial services companies
The total amount of variable income granted in 2019, with respect to the performance over 2018,
amounts to EUR 8,1 million. This grant consists of (direct and deferred) cash and (vested and
unvested) share based instruments. In 2019, one employee was awarded a total compensation of
more than EUR 1 million (in 2018: six employees).
Disclosure on Share Holders Rights Directive (SRDII)
With regard to the remuneration of every Managing Board member a comparison of the annual
changes in the remuneration over two book years (since IPO in 2018), the development of the
company performance and the average (full-time) remuneration of employees need to be disclosed
based on the SRDII.

IN CONTROL REPORT
IN CONTROL REPORT
The responsibilities of the Managing Board are anchored in the principles of the Dutch Financial
Supervision Act (Wet op het financiële toezicht) and other regulations. These responsibilities include
compliance with relevant legislation and the implementation and operation of risk management and
control systems. These management and control systems aim to ensure reliable financial reporting
and to control the downside risk to the operational and financial objectives of NIBC.
Risk management and control
In discharging its responsibility regarding internal risk management and control systems, the Managing
Board acknowledges that in the normal course of business, shortcomings in processes and
procedures arise. The Managing Board has made an assessment of the effectiveness of NIBC’s internal
control and risk management systems. Following identification of any shortcomings, mitigating
controls are performed to determine that no material weaknesses or major control deficiencies
remain. Based on this assessment and to the best of its knowledge, the Managing Board states that:
■ the Report of the Managing Board in the Annual Report 2019 of NIBC provides a fair overview of
and insight into the effectiveness as well as shortcomings of the internal risk management and
control systems;
■ NIBC’s internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that NIBC’s
Annual Report 2019 does not contain any errors of material importance. To address identified
weaknesses, additional mitigating controls have been performed where necessary;
■ there is a reasonable expectation that NIBC Holding N.V. will be able to continue in operation and
meet its liabilities for at least twelve months, as evidenced by the details included in 'performance
evaluation', therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements;
■ there are no material risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the continuity of NIBC Holding N.V.'s enterprise in the coming twelve months.
It should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide
absolute assurance as to the realisation of operational and strategic business objectives, or that they
can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules
and regulations. Nor can they provide certainty that we will achieve our objectives.
In view of the above, the Managing Board of NIBC believes it is in compliance with the requirements
of best practice provision 1.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
Responsibility statement
In respect of Article 5:25c, Section 2 (c) (1 and 2) of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the
members of the Managing Board of NIBC hereby confirm, to the best of their knowledge, that:
■ The annual company and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and income statement of NIBC and its consolidated group companies;
■ The Report of the Managing Board gives a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet
date and developments during the financial year of NIBC and its consolidated group companies; 
■ The Report of the Managing Board describes the material risks which NIBC faces.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Authorisation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of NIBC Bank N.V. for the year ended 31 December 2018 were
authorised for issue by the Supervisory Board and Managing Board on 25 February 2020. NIBC Bank
N.V. is a public liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 31 October 1945, and registered
at Carnegieplein 4, 2517 KJ The Hague, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number
27032036). NIBC Bank N.V. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIBC Holding N.V.
NIBC Bank N.V. together with its subsidiaries (NIBC or the group), provides a broad range of
financial services to corporate- and retail clients. Refer to the Segment report in these financial
statements and the Report of the Managing Board in this Annual Report for detail.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
stated otherwise. Where considered necessary comparative figures have been adjusted to conform
to changes in presentation in the current year.
Statement of compliance
NIBC’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (together IFRS-EU) and with Title 9
of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under a historical cost basis, except for:
■ Financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments, equity investments (including
investments in associates) and certain classes of (investment) property measured at fair value
through profit or loss (FVtPL);
■ Financial assets held for both collecting contractual cash flows and sale measured at fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);
■ Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost to sell.
All figures are rounded to the nearest EUR million, except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying
NIBC’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements section.
Reclassification land and buildings from Property and equipment to Investment
property on 1 January 2019
Until year end 2018 NIBC’s land and buildings were valued at fair value through equity. On 1 January
2019 part of the land and buildings were reclassified from Property & Equipment to Investment
Property, based on the actual change in its use (i.e. a transfer of a significant part to the available-for-
rental status). Just before this reclassification land and buildings were revalued as of 1 January 2019
based on independent external appraisal. The difference with the carrying amount arising from
revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other reserves in shareholders equity. The
142 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
revaluation reserve relating to the reclassified land and buildings to Investment Property for an
amount of EUR 7 million has been frozen as at 1 January 2019.
Changes in accounting policies in 2019
Changes in IFRS-EU
New standards and amendments to standards become effective at the date specified by IFRS-EU, but
may allow companies to opt for an earlier application date. In 2019, the following standards or
amendments to existing standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and
relevant for NIBC, were implemented:

IFRS 16 Leases
NIBC adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect
recognized in retained earnings on 1 January 2019. Under this standard no distinction is drawn
between operating and finance leases for lessees, and requires lessees to recognize leases on the
balance sheet reflecting a right to use an asset for a period of time and the associated lease liability
for payments.
Refer to the following sections in these accounting policies;
■ ‘leases’ accounting policy, and
■ transition impact IFRS 16 as described in this section,
for full detail how IFRS 16 changed NIBC’s accounting policies concerning leases and the transition
approach and impact as per 1 January 2019.
Transition impact IFRS 16
At the date of initial application, NIBC applied the practical expedient to apply the standard to
contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC 4 ‘Determining
whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’.
NIBC also applied the practical expedients for;
■ short-term leases,
■ low value assets.
Lease payments for assets falling under these practical expedients are recognised directly in operating
expenses. The total lease expenses for these assets are separately disclosed in the notes.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 143
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The transition impact of the modified retrospective approach of IFRS 16 on the consolidated balance
sheet of NIBC as per 1 January 2019 is presented in the following table.
1 January 2019 Carrying amount
in EUR millions IFRS 16
Right of use assets 5
Lease liability 6
Retained earnings (1)
The measurement on a lease by lease basis for the right of use assets at transition, is its carrying
amount as if IFRS 16 had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using NIBC’s
incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application.
The impact of the IFRS 16 adoption on the basic and diluted earnings per share as per transition date
and reporting date is nil.
The lease liability as per transition date does not differ materially with the commitments for lease
components of the domestic and foreign offices under IAS 17 as per 31 December 2018, discounted
using the incremental borrowing rate at the transition date.
The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities recognised in the
consolidated balance sheet at the date of initial application is 2%.
Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
Effective from 1 January 2019, NIBC applied the amendments to IAS 28, ‘Long-term Interests in
Associates and Joint Ventures’ retrospectively with the cumulative effect (if any) recognized in
retained earnings on 1 January 2019.
Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the NIBC’s investment in ordinary shares are,
in accordance with the amendments, applied to other long-term interests of NIBC in the associate or
joint venture in reverse order of their respective seniority. These other long-term interests are items
for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, including e.g.
preference shares and long-term receivables or loans, but excluding trade receivables, trade payables
or any long-term receivables for which adequate collateral exists, such as secured loans. If the
associate or joint venture subsequently reports profits, NIBC resumes recognising its share of those
profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
As per 1 January 2019, NIBC did not have such long term interests in associates or joint ventures that
form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is
not applied. The adoption of the amendment did not impact the consolidated financial statements.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle
This cycle contains amendments to the following standards:
144 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IFRS Subject of amendment
IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains
Joint Arrangements control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures
previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS
11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business
that is a joint operation, the entity does not remeasure previously
held interests in that business.
IAS 12 Income Taxes The amendment clarifies that an entity must recognise all income
tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other
comprehensive income or equity, depending on where the entity
recognised the originating transaction or event that generated the
distributable profits giving rise to the dividend.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The amendments clarify that if any specific borrowing remains
outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or
sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity
borrows generally when calculating the capitalisation rate on
general borrowings.
The amendments do not have significant impact on NIBC's consolidated financial statements.
Upcoming changes after 2019
Below standards and amendments to existing standards, published prior to 31 December 2019, were

The amendments provide targeted relief for financial instruments qualifying for 2020 for
hedge accounting in the lead up to IBOR reform. comments
The endorsed upcoming amendments are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, not early adopted)
NIBC applies hedging and hedge accounting on fixed rate assets and liabilities. The IBOR reform can
potentially impact the hedging process and the effectiveness of the hedge accounting process at
moment of the implementation, which is expected during the year 2020. The impact of the IBOR
reform on hedging and hedge accounting is considered low.
For hedge accounting to be applied, future cash flows should be assessed to be highly probable. The
IASB Board has issued an amendment to IAS39 which states that the IBOR reform has no impact on
the highly probable assumption of future cash flows and therefore the hedge accounting process can
be continued on the same basis. There is no impact prospectively.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 145
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The current hedge accounting model uses the EUR-EONIA marked to market curve which will be
replaced in 2020. The hedged position of the bonds in this portfolio amounts to EUR 172 million as
per 31 December 2019.
The retrospective assessment of the hedge accounting relationship is potentially impacted. The
current issued amendment ensures that impact can only occur at time of implementation. Since NIBC
discontinues and reassigns hedge accounting relationships on a monthly basis, the reform will not
interrupt the standing process. The impact of the IBOR reform at time of implementation is expected
to be low.

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of NIBC and its
subsidiaries as at and for the years ended 31 December 2019 and 2018.
Subsidiaries
The group’s subsidiaries are those entities (including structured entities) which it directly or indirectly
controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by the group’s ability to exercise its power in order to
affect any variable returns that the group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity. The
group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored
by third parties for a variety of reasons, including allowing customers to hold investments in separate
legal entities, allowing customers to invest jointly in alternative assets, for asset securitisation
transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection.
When assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the group evaluates a range of control factors,
namely:
■ the purpose and design of the entity;
■ the relevant activities and how these are determined;
■ whether the group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities;
■ whether the group has exposure or rights to variable returns;
■ whether the group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Where voting rights are relevant, the group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or
indirectly, more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another
investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities, as indicated by one or
more of the following factors:
■ another investor has the power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement
with the group; or
■ another investor has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee
under a statute or an agreement; or
146 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ another investor has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board
of directors or equivalent governing body and the investee is controlled by that board or body; or
■ another investor has the power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors
or equivalent governing body and control of that entity is by this board or body.
Potential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.
Likewise, the group also assesses the existence of control where it does not control the majority of
the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise
in circumstances where the size and dispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the group the
power to direct the activities of the investee.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and are
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The group reassesses the consolidation status at least at each financial reporting date. Therefore, any
changes in the structure leading to a change in one or more of the control factors require
reassessment when they occur. This includes changes in decision making rights, changes in contractual
arrangements, changes in the financing, ownership or capital structure as well as changes following a
trigger event which was anticipated in the original documentation.
The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages,
the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquire is re-
measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement
are recognised in the income statement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,
the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquired entity and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference
is recognised directly in the income statement presented under other operating income as negative
goodwill. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for
within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognised in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of
impairment of the assets transferred. The accounting policies of subsidiaries (including structured
entities that the bank consolidates) have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the accounting policies adopted by NIBC.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 147
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions, that is as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling
interests are also recorded in equity.
Disposal of subsidiaries
When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured at its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income
statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting
for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if
the group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This may mean that amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement
(investment income).
Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control. Significant
influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also
is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not
limited to one or more of the following:
■ Representation in the board of directors;
■ Participation in the policymaking process;
■ Interchange of managerial personnel.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The group’s share of post-acquisition results of associates and joint ventures is recognised in the
income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is
recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount
of the investment in associates and joint ventures. When the group’s share of losses in an associate
and joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate and joint venture, the group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on
behalf of the associate or joint venture.
The group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are, except as otherwise described below,
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a
joint venture is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to
recognise the group’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture after the date of
acquisition. The group’s investment in associates or joint ventures includes goodwill identified on
acquisition. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of
the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The group determines at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the
investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the
amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint
148 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
venture and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to investment income (sub line
item share in result of associates) in the income statement.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associate or joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses
are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
If the interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate
share of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the
income statement, where appropriate.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the group
measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the income
statement. If applicable, dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in
the income statement.
With effect from 1 January 2007, all newly acquired investments in associates and joint ventures held
by venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds (as that term is used in IAS 28 and IFRS
11) that qualify as a joint venture or associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value
through profit or loss. Interests held by the group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and
investment funds that are managed on a fair value basis are also accounted for as investments held at
fair value through profit or loss.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segment, has been identified as the Managing
Board of NIBC. For details of NIBC’s operating segments see note 1.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, the functional currency and
presentation currency of NIBC.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement,
except when deferred in equity (other comprehensive income net of tax) as qualifying net investment
hedges.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 149
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Changes in the fair value of monetary loans denominated in foreign currency that are classified at fair
value through other comprehensive income (formerly available for sale) are analysed between foreign
exchange translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the loan. Foreign
exchange translation differences are recognised in the income statement and other changes in the
carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign exchange translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair
value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences
on non-monetary items classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (formerly
available for sale) are included in the revaluation reserve in other comprehensive income.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
■ Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;
■ Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates
of the transactions);
■ All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other
comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments,
are taken to shareholder’s equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, or partially disposed of,
such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Financial instruments
Recognition and classification and measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are
recognised on trade-date, the date on which NIBC commits to purchase or sell the asset.
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost (AC), fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVtPL).
A debt instrument is measured at AC if it meets both of the following conditions:
■ it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual
cash flows;
■ the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions:
150 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets;
■ the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are SPPI.
Equity instruments are accounted for at FVtPL. Other financial assets, not specifically mentioned
above, are measured at FVtPL and consist of held for trading assets, assets mandatorily measured on
a fair value basis and derivatives.
Forward purchases and sales other than those requiring delivery within the time frame established by
regulation or market convention are treated as derivative forward contracts.
Business model assessment
NIBC determines the nature of the business model, for example if the objective is to hold the
financial asset and collect the contractual cash flows, by considering the way in which the financial
assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective as determined by management.
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed on a fair value basis are measured at FVtPL
insofar as the associated business model is neither to hold the financial assets to collect contractual
cash flows nor to hold to collect contractual cash flows and sell.
NIBC mainly originates loans to hold to maturity and in some cases (e.g. in underwriting) to sell or
sub-participate to other parties, resulting in a transfer of substantially all the risks and rewards, and
derecognition of the loan or portions of it. NIBC considers the activities of lending to hold and
lending to sell or sub-participate as two separate business models, with financial assets within the
former considered to be within a business model that has an objective to hold the assets to collect
contractual cash flows, and those within the latter included in a trading portfolio.
Loans originated under originate to manage contracts for third parties are not recognised by NIBC
after completion of their transfer.
NIBC decides to determine its business models at the combination of product and sector level, e.g.,
corporate loan facilities in the different sectors or residential mortgages in the Netherlands.
Contractual cash flow characteristics
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, NIBC considers whether the contractual
terms of the financial asset contain a term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash flows arising over the life of the instrument, which could affect whether the instrument is
considered to meet the SPPI criteria.
The contractual provisions will pass the SPPI test as long as the interest/provisions reflects
consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the instrument during
the term of the instrument and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit.
A prepayment option which substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for the early
termination of the contract, would result in contractual cash flows that are SPPI on the principal
amount outstanding. This means that prepayment amounts will still meet the SPPI criteria even if it
includes what is deemed reasonable and market conform for early compensation.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 151
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. In the case of financial instruments
subsequently measured at AC or FVOCI, the initial fair value is adjusted for directly attributable
transaction costs.
After initial recognition, NIBC classifies measures and presents its financial assets and financial
liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9 as described in the table on the following pages.

Derecognition, restructured and modified financial assets
When a counterparty is in financial difficulties or where default has already occurred, NIBC may
restructure financial assets by providing concessions that would otherwise not be considered and that
are outside of NIBC’s normal risk appetite, such as preferential interest rates, extension of maturity
and subordination. When a credit restructuring takes place, each case is considered individually and
the counterparty is classified as defaulted until the loan is collected or written off, non-preferential
conditions are granted that supersede the preferential conditions, or until the counterparty has
recovered and the preferential conditions no longer exceed NIBC’s risk appetite.
Concessions granted when there is no evidence of financial difficulties, or where changes to terms
and conditions are within NIBC’s usual risk appetite, are not considered to be a credit restructuring.
Modifications represent contract amendments that result in an alteration of future contractual cash
flows and that can occur within NIBC’s normal risk appetite or as part of a credit restructuring where
a counterparty is in financial difficulties.
NIBC derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions
have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference
recognised in the income statement. If the new discounted present value is at least 10% different and
greater than EUR 1 million from the original financial assets carrying value, NIBC considers the
154 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
modification as substantial. Qualitative thresholds to decide whether a modification is substantial are
change in currency or change in counterparty. Where the modification does not result in a
derecognition, any difference between the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original
EIR and the existing gross carrying value of a financial asset is recognised in profit or loss as a
modification gain or loss. Further, the subsequent SICR assessment is made by comparing the risk of
default at the reporting date based on the modified contractual terms of the financial asset with the
risk of default at initial recognition based on the original, unmodified contractual terms of the financial
asset.
Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the
cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) NIBC
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) NIBC neither transfers nor retains
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and NIBC has not retained control.
Fair value estimation
IFRS 13 requires for financial instruments and non-financial instruments that are measured at fair
value in the balance sheet disclosure of each class of financial assets and liabilities within a three-level
hierarchy, referring to the respective basis of fair value measurement as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
Determination of fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell or paid to transfer a
particular asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which NIBC has access at
that date. NIBC determines fair value either by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price
quotations without adjustment for transaction costs for those financial instruments that are currently
traded in an active market. The fair value measurement is based upon the bid price for financial assets
and the ask price for financial liabilities. These financial instruments are reported as level 1 in the fair
value hierarchy.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and
regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s
length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.
The fair value of financial instruments not quoted in an active market is determined using appropriate
valuation techniques. These valuation techniques are applied using, where possible, relevant market
observable inputs (level 2) or unobservable inputs (level 3). Valuation techniques include the
discounted cash flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which market observable prices
exist, option pricing models, credit models and other relevant models.
Certain financial instruments are recorded at fair value using valuation techniques in which current
market transactions or observable market data are not available. Their fair value is determined using a
valuation technique based on NIBC’s best estimate of the most appropriate assumptions and that has
been calibrated against actual market transactions. Outcomes are adjusted to reflect the spread for
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 155
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
bid and ask prices, to reflect costs to close out positions, where necessary for counterparty credit
and liquidity spread, and for any other limitations in the technique. Profit or loss, calculated upon
initial recognition (day one profit or loss), is deferred unless the calculation is based on market
observable inputs, in which case it is immediately recognised. Deferred day one profit or loss is
amortised to income over the contractual life until maturity or settlement.
The fair value of on demand deposits from customers is not less than the amount payable on
demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.
The level within the fair value hierarchy at which an instrument measured at fair value is categorised is
determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement of fair value
in its entirety.
NIBC recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.
See note 45 for an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how
they are measured.
Recognition of day one profit or loss
The best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is the transaction price (that is, the fair value of
the consideration given or received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by
comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (that is,
without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only
data from observable markets.
NIBC has entered into transactions where fair value is determined using valuation models for which
not all inputs are market observable prices or rates. Such financial instruments are initially recognised
at the transaction price, which is the best indicator of fair value, although the value obtained from the
relevant valuation model may differ. Significant differences between the transaction price and the
model value, commonly referred to as day one profit or loss, are not recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Deferred day one profit or losses are amortised to income over the life until maturity or settlement.
The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value as determined by the relevant model
adjusted for any deferred day one profit or loss.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value
The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for
disclosure purposes of those financial instruments which are not recorded at fair value in the financial
statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying amount
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than three months), it
is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate fair value. This assumption is also applied to
demand deposits from customers and customer savings with a specific maturity.
Fixed-rate financial instruments
The fair values of Fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by
comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates for
156 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed-interest bearing deposits is based on
discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk
and maturity. For quoted debt issued, the fair values are determined based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model
is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity
and on credit spreads. For other variable rate instruments, an adjustment is also made to reflect the
change in required credit spread since initial recognition.
See note 45 for the fair values of NIBC’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the
balance sheet.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when,
and only when, NIBC has currently a legally enforceable right to set-off the amounts and the group
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS.
Collateral
NIBC enters into master agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) with counterparties
whenever possible and when appropriate. Master agreements provide that, if the master agreement is
being terminated as a consequence of an event of default or termination event, all outstanding
transactions with the counterparty will fall due and all amounts outstanding will be settled on a net
basis. In the case of a CSA with counterparties, the group has the right to obtain collateral for the net
counterparty exposure.
NIBC obtains collateral in respect of counterparty liabilities when this is considered appropriate. The
collateral normally takes the form of a pledge over the counterparty’s assets and gives NIBC a claim
on these assets for both existing and future liabilities.
NIBC also pays and receives collateral in the form of cash or securities in respect of other credit
instruments, such as derivative contracts, in order to reduce credit risk. Collateral paid or received in
the form of cash together with the underlying is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Any
interest payable or receivable arising is recorded as interest expense or interest income respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
NIBC uses derivative financial instruments both for trading and hedging purposes. NIBC uses
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks and
to credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured, and are subsequently re-measured, at fair value.
The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is obtained from quoted market prices. Fair values of
over-the-counter derivatives are obtained using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow
models and option pricing models.
The method of recognising fair value gains and losses depends on whether the derivatives are held
for trading or are designated as hedging instruments and if the latter, the nature of the risks being
hedged. All gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are
recognised in the income statement in net trading income.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 157
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
When derivatives are designated as hedges, NIBC classifies them as either (i) a fair value hedge of
interest rate risk (‘portfolio fair value hedges’); (ii) a fair value hedge of interest rate risk or foreign
exchange rate risk (‘micro fair value hedges’) (iii) a cash flow hedge of the variability of highly
probable cash flows (‘cash flow hedges’) Hedge accounting is applied to derivatives designated as
hedging instruments, provided certain criteria are met.
Hedge accounting
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the criteria
specified in IAS 39, NIBC applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging
of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate, to the risks being hedged.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, NIBC documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking the
hedge. NIBC also requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether or not the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in
offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.
Interest on designated qualifying hedges is included in net interest income.
NIBC discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
■ It is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
■ The derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised;
■ The hedged item matures, or is sold or repaid;
■ A forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable; or
■ It voluntarily decides to discontinue the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting and fair value hedge accounting on a micro level.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging
instruments are recorded in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to
the hedged risk.
If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative fair value
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over
the remaining period to maturity using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is
derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income
statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Portfolio fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk arising on portfolios of
fixed-interest rate loans (recognised at amortised cost), to portfolios of plain vanilla fixed-interest
rate funding (liabilities classified as amortised cost) and to the residual interest rate risk from retail
deposits and mortgages.
In order to apply portfolio fair value hedge accounting, the cash flows arising on the portfolios are
scheduled into time buckets based upon when the cash flows are expected to occur. For the first
two years, cash flows are scheduled using monthly time buckets; thereafter annual time buckets are
used. Hedging instruments are designated for each time bucket, together with an amount of assets or
liabilities that NIBC is seeking to hedge. Designation and de-designation of hedging relationships is
158 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
undertaken on a monthly basis, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging
relationship at a portfolio level, across all time buckets.
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item.
Micro fair value hedge
NIBC applies micro fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk and/or the foreign exchange
risk arising from debt investments at FVOCI (formerly available-for-sale) and fixed-interest rate
funding.
(Cross-currency) interest rate swaps are used as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the
income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the
hedged risks.
Effectiveness is tested retrospectively on a monthly basis by comparing the cumulative clean fair value
movement (since inception) of the hedged item, due to changes in both benchmark interest rates
and foreign exchange rates, to the total clean fair value movement of the hedging instrument (the
cumulative dollar offset method).
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item. In this case, the micro hedge relationship is de-
designated and it is re-designated at the beginning of the next period if expected to be highly
effective prospectively.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to hedge the variability arising on expected future cash flows
due to interest rate risk on loans at amortised cost with floating interest rates. As interest rates
fluctuate, the future cash flows on these instruments also fluctuate. NIBC uses interest rate swaps to
hedge the risk of such cash flow fluctuations. Cash flow hedges are always on portfolio level.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income as net result of hedging
instruments. Any gain or loss in fair value relating to an ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the
periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When a hedging instrument
expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative
gain or loss in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income
until the forecast cash flow is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive
income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 159
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Hedge effectiveness testing
To qualify for hedge accounting, NIBC requires that at the inception of the hedge and throughout its
life, each hedge must be expected to be highly effective (prospective effectiveness). Actual
effectiveness (retrospective effectiveness) must also be demonstrated on an ongoing basis.
The documentation of each hedging relationship describes how effectiveness will be assessed. For
prospective effectiveness, the hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for
which the hedge is designated. For actual effectiveness, the changes in fair value or cash flows must
offset each other in the bandwidth of 80% - 125% for the hedge to be deemed effective.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.
Sale and repurchase transactions
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (Repos) are reclassified in the financial statements as
pledged assets when the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or re-pledge the
collateral; the counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks or other deposits as
appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (Reverse repos) are recorded as loans and advances
to other banks or customers, as appropriate. The difference between sale and repurchase price is
treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Expected credit losses (ECL)
NIBC recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured
at FVtPL:
■ financial assets that are debt instruments;
■ lease receivables;
■ financial guarantee contracts issued;
■ loan commitments issued.
No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments because they are classified at FVtPL.
Recognition of expected credit losses
ECL represents the difference between contractual cash flows and the actual cash flows NIBC
expects to receive, discounted at the EIR. For loan commitments and other credit facilities in scope of
ECL, expected cash shortfalls are determined by considering expected future drawdowns during the
contractual life of the instruments.
ECL are recognised on the following basis:
■ A maximum 12-month ECL are recognised from initial recognition, reflecting the portion of
lifetime cash shortfalls that would result if a default occurs in the 12 months after the reporting
date, weighted by the risk of a default occurring. Instruments in this category are referred to as
instruments in stage 1. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, ECL are
determined for this shorter period;
■ Lifetime ECL are recognised if a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) is detected subsequent to
the instrument’s initial recognition, reflecting lifetime cash shortfalls that would result from all
possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, weighted by the risk of a
160 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
default occurring. Instruments in this category are referred to as instruments in stage 2. The
moment SICR is no longer observed, the instrument moves back to stage 1.
■ Lifetime ECL are also recognised for credit-impaired financial instruments, referred to as
instruments in stage 3. The IFRS 9 determination of whether an instrument is credit-impaired is
based on the occurrence of one or more loss events with lifetime ECL derived by estimating
expected cash flows based on a chosen recovery strategy with additional consideration given to
forward-looking economic scenarios. Credit-impaired exposures may include positions for which
no loss has occurred or no allowance has been recognised, because they are expected to be fully
recoverable through the collateral held. For clarity and alignment the definition of credit-impaired,
stage 3 and defaulted were fully aligned. So a defaulted loan is by definition considered credit-
 impaired in the Capital Requirements Regulation in combination with further guidance and
clarification on this definition provided by European Banking Authority.
■ Changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are also recognised for assets that are purchased
or originated credit impaired financial assets (POCI). POCI are initially recognised at fair value with
interest income subsequently being recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. POCI include
financial instruments that are newly recognised following a substantial restructuring and remain a
separate ECL-category until maturity.
NIBC applies the low credit risk exemption for part of the debt investments, being the liquidity
portfolio. NIBC considers a debt investment to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is
equivalent to the definition of 'investment grade'.
NIBC has a portfolio of lease receivables. NIBC elected to apply the general, not the simplified, ECL
approach for lease receivables.
ECL are recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding ECL allowance reported as a decrease in
the carrying value of financial assets measured at AC on the balance sheet. For financial assets
measured at FVOCI, the carrying value is not reduced, but an accumulated amount is recognised in
OCI.
For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines not recognised (i.e. related to
undrawn positions), provisions for ECL are reported in Provisions. ECL are recognised within the
income statement in Credit loss expense / recovery.
Default and credit impairment
A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of
the two following events have taken place:
1. NIBC considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by
NIBC to actions such as realising security (if held).
2. The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Group.
An instrument is classified as credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental
impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a
financial asset is credit-impaired include observable data about the following events:
1. significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the client;
2. a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
3. NIBC, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having
granted to the client a concession(s) that NIBC would not otherwise consider;
4. it is becoming probable that the client will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
5. the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 161
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6. the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit
losses.
Once a financial asset is classified as defaulted / credit-impaired (except POCIs), it remains as such
unless all past due amounts have been rectified, additional payments have been made on time, the
position is not classified as credit-restructured, and there is general evidence of credit recovery.
Interest revenue on financial assets that are not credit impaired (i.e., in stages 1 and 2) is calculated by
applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset. Once a financial asset is
credit impaired, interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised
cost of the financial asset, i.e., the gross carrying amount less the expected credit losses. If a financial
asset ‘cures’, so that it is transferred back to stage 2 or stage 1, interest revenue is again recognised
based on the gross carrying amount. The adjustment required to bring the loss allowance to the
amount required is presented as a Credit loss recovery in the consolidated income statement instead
of under Net interest income.
Write-off
A write-off is made when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven (e.g. in
cases of bankruptcy or distressed restructuring). Write-offs reduce the principal amount of a claim
and are charged against previously established allowances for credit losses. Recoveries, in part or in
full, of amounts previously written off are credited to Credit loss expense / recovery. Write-offs and
partial write-offs represent derecognition / partial derecognition events.
Measurement of ECL
NIBC calculates ECL's based on three probability-weighted scenarios (baseline, upturn and
downturn) to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A
cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to NIBC in accordance with the
contract and the cash flows that NIBC expects to receive.
The 12-month ECL (12M-ECL) and the Lifetime ECL (LT-ECL) represent the expected credit
losses that result from all possible default events over the next 12 months and the expected
remaining life of the instrument respectively. 12M-ECL and LT-ECL are calculated as a probability
weighted-average over the three macroeconomic scenarios and are based on the unbiased and
point-in-time estimates of Probability of Default (PIT-PD), Loss Given Default (PIT-LGD) and
Exposure at Default (PIT-EAD).
Credit losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or
gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset's gross carrying value.
The measurement of the ECL is summarised as follows:
ECL Measurement
Stage 1 The 12M-ECL is calculated as the portion of LT-ECLs that represent the ECLs that result from
default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months or a shorter
period if applicable after the reporting date. NIBC calculates the 12M-ECL allowance based on
the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These
expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the
expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.
Stage 2 When a loan has shown a SICR since origination, NIBC records an allowance for the LT-ECLs.
The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but
ECL calculations are summed over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls
162 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. The EIR calculation for the corporate
exposures comprises of the current base rate plus an add-on. This rate is fixed to discount the
cash-flows over the remaining life of the loan until its legal maturity. This rate applies to all
financial instruments, including undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees. The EIR
calculation for retail mortgage loans is based on the current coupon rate. The rate is fixed over
the remaining life of the loan until its contractual maturity date.
Stage 3 For loans considered credit-impaired, NIBC recognises the LT-ECL, based on facility level
individual cash flow estimates determined by Restructuring & Distressed Assets (RDA). RDA
applies at least three scenarios (unless it is 100% impaired) and assigns probabilities to each of
these scenarios. Focus is on recovery of the client, while in parallel an enforcement strategy, a
loan trade or sale of the company are considered as alternative scenarios. The method is
conceptually similar to that for Stage 2 assets, but requires an individual assessment. For the
purpose of impairment calculation, the EIR is approximated by the sum of the applicable swap
curve plus the original contractual margin.
POCI POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. NIBC only
recognises the cumulative changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition, based on a
probability-weighting of the three scenarios, discounted by the credit-adjusted EIR.
Loan When estimating LT-ECLs for undrawn loan commitments, NIBC estimates the expected
commitments portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its contractual life. The ECL is
and letters of then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn
credit down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are
discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan. 
For loan commitments relating to revolving facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn
commitment, ECLs are calculated and presented together with the loan. For fully undrawn loan
commitments and letters of credit, the ECL is recognised within Provisions.
Financial NIBC's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially
guarantee recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the income statement, and the ECL
contracts provision. For this purpose, NIBC estimates ECLs based on the present value of the expected
payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The calculation is made using a
probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee contracts
are recognised within Provisions.
Both 12M-ECL and LT-ECL are calculated on an individual basis.
Movements of the financial instruments between the different stages due to changed credit risk
profiles are disclosed in the movement schedules in the notes to these consolidated financial
statements. Movements between changes or credit loss allowances, caused by eventual changes in the
models or in the input parameters used, are disclosed as separate items in these movement
schedules.
Scenarios and scenario weights
The determination of the probability weighted ECL requires evaluating a range of relevant future
economic conditions. To accommodate this requirement, NIBC uses three different macroeconomic
scenarios in the ECL calculation: a baseline, an upturn and a downturn scenario. Each scenario is
represented by a specific scenario narrative, scenario probability and a set of macroeconomic factors.
A weight is computed for each scenario by using a probabilistic econometric model that considers
recent information as well as several decades of historical data. The determined weights constitute
the probabilities that the respective macroeconomic developments will occur. The scenarios, including
the narratives, the macroeconomic forecasts and the scenario weights, are further discussed,

Macro-economic and other factors
The range of macroeconomic, market and other factors that is modelled as part of the scenario
determination is wide, and historical information is used to support the identification of the key
factors. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of information decreases and judgment
increases. The macroeconomic forecast has an influence on PDs only during the first 5 years. During
years 6-10 the model applies reversion to the mean (i.e. the Point-in-Time (PiT) PD converges with
the Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD) and after year 11 the PDs are influenced only by the TTC matrix.
The forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions used in the ECL calculation are derived from
Moody’s Data Buffet. NIBC has identified different segments to allow for specific risks and forecasts
to be incorporated in the macroeconomic scenarios. The segments include:
■ Corporate General;
■ Corporate Offshore Energy;
■ Corporate Shipping; and
■ Retail.

ECL Measurement period
The maximum period for which the ECL are determined is the contractual life of a financial
instrument unless NIBC has the legal right to call it earlier. For revolving facilities the ECL are
measured over the period NIBC is exposed to credit risk.
Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)
Financial instruments subject to ECL are monitored on an ongoing basis which includes an assessment
whether SICR has occurred. The assessment criteria include both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Qualitative factors are forbearance measures, Watch List and/or managed by RDA and the
quantitative factor is increase in PD since initial recognition.

forbearance probation period is two years.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 165
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (Cash-Generating Units - CGUs). Non-financial assets, other than
goodwill that suffered an impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date. Impairment losses and the reversal of such losses, for non-financial assets other than
goodwill, are recognised directly in the income statement.
There were no impairments on non-financial assets in the years 2019 and 2018.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of NIBC’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is
included in investments in associates. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently
when there are indications that impairment may have occurred and carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the
goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment.
Trademarks and licences
Separately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and licences
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks
and licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and
licences over their estimated useful lives of ten years.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three
years.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
expected life of the customer relationship.
Impairment of intangible assets
At each reporting date, NIBC assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable (see impairment – non-financial assets).
166 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tangible assets
Property (land and buildings) and equipment
Land and buildings comprise offices and are measured at fair value (revaluation model). This fair value
is based on the most recent appraisals by independent registered appraisers, less straight-line
depreciation for buildings over the estimated economic life taking into account any residual value.
Buildings in own use are valued at market value on an unlet or let basis. If arm’s length lease
agreements have been concluded between NIBC group companies, the building is recognised at its
value as a let property. If there is no lease agreement, the property is recognised as vacant property.
Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the carrying amount of
the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising from revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other
reserves in shareholder’s equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are
charged against other reserves directly in other comprehensive income; all other decreases are
charged to the income statement. Each year, the difference between depreciation based on the re-
valued carrying amount of the asset charged to the income statement and depreciation based on the
asset’s original cost is transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to
allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as
follows:
Depreciation
Buildings 30 - 50 years
Machinery 4 - 10 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 - 10 years
Right-of-use assets: Offices 5 - 20 years
Assets under operating leases 1 - 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting
date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised within other operating income. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts
included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 167
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Investment property
Investment property is property (land or a building - or part of a building - or both) held to earn
rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or
services, for administrative purposes or sale in the ordinary course of business.
Investment property is initially measured at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change
therein recognised in the income statement.
Where the group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value
immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in
the income statement within net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss.
Leases
A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration.
For contracts that contain both lease components and non-lease components, such as a maintenance
services, NIBC allocates the consideration payable on the basis of the relative stand-alone prices,
which are estimated if observable prices are not readily available.
A group company is the lessee
Upon lease commencement NIBC recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use
asset is initially measured at cost, comprising:
■ the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability,
■ lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the lease contract, less lease
incentives received;
■ initial direct costs; and
■ an estimate of costs to be incurred by NIBC in dismantling and removing the underlying asset,
restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required
by the terms and conditions of the lease. NIBC incurs the obligation for those costs either at the
commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular
period.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the
lease term, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate
cannot be readily determined, NIBC uses its incremental borrowing rate.
NIBC classifies the right-of-use assets as part of “Property and Equipment”, and subsequently applies
■ the impairment requirements from IAS 36, and
■ the depreciation requirements from IAS 16.
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured to reflect changes in:
■ the lease term (using a revised discount rate);
■ the assessment of a purchase option (using a revised discount rate);
■ the amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees (using an unchanged
discount rate); or
■ future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those
payments (using an unchanged discount rate).
168 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The remeasurements are treated as adjustments to the right-of-use asset.
Lease modifications may also prompt remeasurement of the lease liability unless they are to be
treated as separate leases.
The right-of-use assets are presented within the note ‘Property and equipment’, and the lease
liabilities are presented within the note ‘Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities’.
NIBC applies the following practical expedients;
■ short-term leases (no right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognised for lease terms of 12
months or less at commencement date),
■ low value assets (this includes, leases for which the underlying assets have a value lower or equal
to EUR 5,000; leases leading to recognition of a Right-of-Use asset lower or equal to EUR 10,000;
leases of similar underlying assets (like e.g. printers) leading to a total Right-of-Use asset of lower
or equal to EUR 50,000, or leases of a group of assets whereby the costs and benefits of RoU
asset recognition do not justify the reporting requirements).
Lease payments for assets falling under these practical expedients are recognised directly in operating
expenses. The total lease expenses for these assets are separately disclosed in the notes.
A group company is the lessor
NIBC classifies each lease as an operating lease or a finance lease.
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of an underlying asset. Otherwise a lease is classified as an operating lease.
When assets are held subject to a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments is
recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the
receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of
the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of
return.
NIBC's subsidiary Beequip B.V. primarily focuses on finance leases of used equipment, mainly for small
and medium enterprises in the sectors infrastructure, earth-moving construction and logistics sector.
When assets are held subject to an operating lease, the assets are included in assets held under
operating leases under property and equipment.
Rental income from operating leases from portfolio of German Residential and Commercial property
managed by NIBC is recognised in other operating income on a straight line basis over the lease term
net of discounts and other deductions.
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, NIBC issues financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit,
guarantees and acceptances. Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements
(within ‘other liabilities’) at fair value, being the premium received and subsequently measured at the
higher of the amount of the loss allowance; and the premium received on initial recognition less
income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15. Any increase in the liability relating to
financial guarantees is recorded in the income statement in credit loss expenses. The premium
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 169
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
received is recognised in the income statement in fee and commission income on a straight line basis
over the life of the guarantee.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with
less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and non-restricted
balances with central banks and net credit balances on current accounts with other banks.
Cash balances are measured at face value while bank balances are measured at cost.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is
considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,
financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under
insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal
group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value
less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss
previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-
current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or
amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for
sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal
group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as
held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,
is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a
subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are
presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, if material, the comparative income
statement and cash flow statement are represented as if the operation had been discontinued from
the start of the comparative period.
Provisions
Provisions contains:
■ ECL allowances for off-balance sheet financial instruments;
■ Restructuring and/or reorganisation provisions;
■ Employee benefits;
■ Other provisions.
170 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in
settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised
even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of
obligations may be remote.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected required expenditure to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is
recognised as interest expense. Provisions are presented under other liabilities.
Contingent liabilities, if applicable, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed,
unless they are remote.
ECL allowances for off-balance sheet financial instruments
For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines not recognised (i.e. related to
undrawn positions), provisions for ECL are reported in Provisions. ECL are recognised within the
income statement in Credit loss expense / recovery.
Restructuring and/or reorganisation provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when:
■ The group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;
■ It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation;
■ The amount has been reliably estimated.
A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when the group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring identifying at least:
■ the business or part of a business concerned;
■ the principal locations affected;
■ the location, function, and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for
terminating their services;
■ the expenditures that will be undertaken;
■ when the plan will be implemented; and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will
carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to
those affected by it.
The group does not recognise provisions for projected future operating losses.
Employee benefits
Pension benefits
NIBC operates a defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable to a defined
contribution plan is in proportion to the services rendered to NIBC by the employees and is
recorded as an expense under personnel expenses and share-based payments. Unpaid contributions
are recorded as a liability. NIBC does not operate a defined benefit plan.
Termination benefits
NIBC recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group can no
longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In
the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 171
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
Share-based compensation
NIBC operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
Equity-settled transactions
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the
entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (shares or options) of
the group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to
the fair value of the shares or options granted:
■ Including any market performance conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares or options
that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the
period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each
reporting period, NIBC revises its estimates of the number of shares or options that are expected to
vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. NIBC recognises the impact of the revision to
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is
conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the
market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied. Similarly, awards
of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions are treated as vesting if all vesting conditions that
are not market conditions are met, irrespective of whether the non-vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised in
personnel expenses is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment
arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation,
and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award
where non-vesting conditions within the control of either NIBC or the counterparty are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award.
Cash-settled transactions
For the cash-settled share-based compensation plan, the fair value of the employee services received
in exchange for the grant of share-based compensation is recognised as a liability. The liability is re-
measured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value
recognised in the income statement in personnel expenses. The social security contributions payable
in connection with the grant of the share options are considered an integral part of the grant itself,
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
172 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
A liability is recognised for cash-settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to our shareholder after certain adjustments. NIBC recognises a
liability where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive
obligation.
Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
shareholder’s equity (other comprehensive income), in which case it is recognised in shareholder’s
equity (other comprehensive income).
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax
rates (and laws) enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when NIBC intends to
settle on a net basis and a legal right of offset exists.
Deferred income tax is provided for in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
NIBC’s principal temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and
liabilities including derivative contracts, the depreciation of property and tax losses carried forward
and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired
and their tax base.
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries
and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry-forward are recognised as an asset when it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax related to the fair value remeasurement of available for sale investments and cash flow
hedges, which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, is also credited or
charged directly to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income
statement when the deferred gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 173
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Equity
Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is not a contractual obligation to transfer cash or other
financial assets.
Capital securities
As there is no formal obligation to (re)pay the principal or to pay a dividend the capital securities are
recognised as equity and dividends paid on capital securities are recognised directly in equity.
Issue costs of shares and capital securities
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities are recognised as a liability in the period that the
obligation for payment has been established, being in the period in which they are approved by the
shareholder.
Revenue recognition
As detailed in the sub-sections below, NIBC recognises the revenue on financial instruments in:
■ net interest income;
■ investment income;
■ net trading income;
■ net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL;
■ net gains or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC
in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
In accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, revenue from finance lease contracts are included in interest
income and revenue from operating lease contracts in other operating income.
NIBC recognises revenue in relation to:
■ net fee income;
■ other operating income,
in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when (or as) a performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service (ie an asset) to a customer. An asset is
transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods
and services in the ordinary course of NIBC’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within NIBC.
Net interest income
Interest income and expense from financial instruments measured at AC and FVOCI are recognised
in the income statement applying the EIR method. In determining interest income and expense, the
EIR is applied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (unless the asset is credit-impaired)
or the AC of a financial liability, based on estimated future cash flows that take into account all
contractual cash flows. However, when a financial asset becomes credit-impaired after initial
174 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
recognition, interest income is determined by applying EIR to the net carrying amount of the
instrument. Furthermore, for financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest
is determined by applying a credit-adjusted EIR to the AC of the instrument.
Penalty interest is directly recognised under interest income in case of early redemption ((partly)
derecognition of the related financial instrument). Penalty interest is directly recognised under interest
income in case of an interest reset.
Interest income from financial assets measured at FVtPL is recognised applying the contractual
interest rates. Deviations between the contractual interest rates and the prevailing market rates of
interest for a similar instrument (e.g. caused by performance related fees) are recognised in Net gains
or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL.
Interest income on financial instruments measured at AC and financial assets measured at FVOCI are
presented separately within Interest income from financial instruments measured at AC and FVOCI and
Interest expense from financial instruments measured at AC, with interest on financial instruments at
FVtPL presented in Interest income (or expense) from financial instruments measured at FVtPL.
Net fee income
NIBC earns fee income from a diverse range of services it provides to its clients. Fee income can be
divided into two broad categories:
■ fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time, such as (originate to
manage) asset or investment management,
■ fees earned from point in time services such as underwriting and brokerage fees, structuring – and
advisory fees, and performance linked fees from investment management activities.
Over time services
Fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time are recognised ratably over
the service period provided the fees are not contingent on successfully meeting specified
performance criteria that are beyond the control of NIBC (see measurement below).
Costs to fulfil over time services are recorded in the income statement immediately because such
services are considered to be a series of services that are substantially the same from day to day and
have the same pattern of transfer.
Point in time services
Fees earned from providing transaction-type services are recognised when the service has been
completed provided such fees are not highly probable subject to refund or another contingency
beyond the control of NIBC.
Measurement
Fee income is measured based on consideration specified in a legally enforceable contract with a
customer, excluding amounts such as taxes collected on behalf of third parties. Consideration can
include both fixed and variable amounts. Variable consideration includes refunds, discounts,
performance bonuses and other amounts that are contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence
of a future event. Variable consideration that is contingent on an uncertain event can only be
recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of
cumulative revenue for a contract will not occur. NIBC estimates an amount of variable consideration
by using the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (ie the single
most likely outcome of the contract).

that are attributable to changes in NIBC Holding’s own credit risk).
Net gain or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC
The line item Net gain or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC includes the
differences between the carrying value just before derecognition and total consideration received at
the sale of a financial asset measured at AC.
Rental income
The group manages a portfolio of German Residential and Commercial Property. Rental income from
operating leases from the German Residential and Commercial Property is recognised in income on
a straight line basis over the lease term net of discounts and other deductions.
Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculation, gives details of the source
of cash and cash equivalents that became available during the year and the application of these cash
and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from
operating activities, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities.
Movements in loans and receivables and inter-bank deposits are included in the cash flow from
operating activities. Investing activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect
of financial investments, as well as investments in and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property,
plant and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are
treated as financing activities. Movements due to currency translation differences as well as the effects
of the consolidation of acquisitions, where of material significance, are eliminated from the cash flow
figures.
Fiduciary activities
NIBC acts in fiduciary activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals,
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. The assets are excluded from these financial
statements as they are not assets of the group. Related fee and commission income arising thereon is
recognised under fee and commission income.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
NIBC Holding makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances.
Estimates and judgements are principally made in the following areas:
■ Fair value of certain financial instruments;
■ Expected credit losses of financial instruments not measured at FVtPL;
■ Income taxes, and
■ Consolidation of structured entities.
Fair value of certain financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on quoted market prices in an active
market or, where no active market exists, by using valuation techniques. In cases where valuation
techniques are used, the fair values are estimated from market observable data, if available, or by
using models. Where market-observable inputs are not available, they are estimated based on
appropriate assumptions.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically
reviewed by qualified personnel independent of those who prepared them. All models are reviewed
prior to use and models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative
market prices. To the extent possible, models use only observable data; however, in areas such as
applicable credit spreads (both own credit spread and counterparty credit spreads), volatilities and
correlations may require management to estimate inputs.
Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. For the
identification of assumptions used in the determination of fair value of financial instruments and for
estimated sensitivity information for level 3 financial instruments, except for own liabilities (see note
45).
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
At 31 December 2019, the fair value of these liabilities was estimated to be EUR 390 million
(31 December 2018: EUR 483 million). This portfolio is designated at fair value through profit or loss
and is reported on the face of the balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Own debt securities in issue;
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Debt securities in issue structured;
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Subordinated liabilities.
The portion of fair value changes on these liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
during 2019 attributable to the movement in credit spreads as reported in notes 35, 36 and 41
reflects gross amounts, excluding pull-to-par and model refinement effects.
The bank estimates its own credit risk from market observable data such as NIBC senior unsecured
issues, NIBC subordinated issues and secondary prices for its traded debt.
178 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The valuation of all the above classes of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or
loss is sensitive to the estimated credit spread used to discount future expected cash flows.
A 10 basis point change in the weighted average credit spread used to discount future expected cash
flows would change the fair value of these own financial liabilities at 31 December 2019 by
EUR 2 million (31 December 2018: EUR 2 million).
Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation
adjustment)
Credit Valuation Adjustments & Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs and DVAs) are incorporated into
derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of respectively the counterparty and NIBC. In
essence, CVA represents an estimate of the discounted expected loss on an Over The Counter (OTC)
derivative during the lifetime of a contract. DVA represents the estimate of the discounted expected
loss from the counterparty’s perspective. Both CVA and DVAs are applied to all OTC derivative
contracts, except those that benefit from a strong collateral agreement where cash collateral is
regularly exchanged, mitigating credit risk.
Fair value of equity investments
The group estimates the fair value of its equity investments using valuation models, and it applies the
valuation principles set forth by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation
Guidelines to the extent that these are consistent with IFRS 9.
On 31 December 2019, the fair value of this portfolio, reported as equity investments (including
investments in associates) at fair value through profit or loss was estimated to be EUR 253 million
(31 December 2018: EUR 187 million).
For the determination of the fair value of equity investments and for estimated sensitivity to key
assumptions in the valuation, see note 45.
Expected credit losses (ECL) of financial instruments not measured at
FVtPL
The calculation of ECL requires management to apply significant judgment and make estimates and
assumptions that involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. Changes to these
estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be
recognised. Reference is made to the corresponding notes for the nature and carrying amounts of
the ECL of financial instruments not measured at FVtPL.
Determination of a significant increase of credit risk (SICR)
IFRS 9 does not include a definition of what constitutes SICR. NIBC assesses whether an SICR has
occurred since initial recognition based on qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable
forward-looking information that includes significant management judgment. More stringent criteria
could significantly increase the number of instruments migrating to stage 2.
Scenarios, scenario weights and macroeconomic factors
ECL reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount, which NIBC determines by evaluating a
range of possible outcomes. Management selects forward-looking scenarios and judges the suitability
of respective weights to be applied. Changes in the scenarios and weights, the corresponding set of
macroeconomic variables and the assumptions made around those variables for the forecast horizon
would have a significant effect on the ECL.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 179
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The macroeconomic projections in the baseline scenario are the most important determinant of the
final ECL amount. The combined impact of MES, applied to the corporate loan and mortgage loan
portfolios, on the ECL is limited (1% of Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL).
ECL measurement period
Lifetime ECL are determined based upon the contractual maturity of the transaction (other than
revolving facilities), which significantly affects ECL. The ECL calculation is therefore sensitive to any
extension of contractual maturities triggered by business decisions, customer behaviour or an
increased number of stage 2 positions.
Modelling and management adjustments
A number of complex models have been developed or modified to calculate ECL. Internal
counterparty rating changes, new or revised models and data may significantly affect ECL.
Management adjustments, based on counterparty details, can be applicable to resolve technical issues
in the processing of stage 1 and stage 2 ECL. The models are governed by NIBC’s risk department,
which aims to ensure independent verification.
Changes to the assumptions in the models are subject to approval by the Risk Management
Committee (RMC) or ALCO of NIBC.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NIBC measures stage 3 ECL on an individual facility level based upon a weighted average of three
scenarios using a baseline, an upside and a downside scenario. The forecasted cash flows for each
scenario are estimated by the Restructuring & Distressed Assets (RDA) department. Accordingly, the
assumptions applied are based upon an assessment of individual facilities by our internal experts and
no collective credit risk model is applied. The ECL 3 is sensitive to the application of these
assumptions.

Income taxes
Deferred tax assets are included only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near
future against which these temporary differences can be offset. When determining future taxable
profits, estimates are used since these are subject to uncertainty.
On 31 December 2019 there was a realistic expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be
generated within the applicable periods for the recognised deferred tax asset based on internal
(medium term) forecasts. The terms to maturity of the Dutch carry forward losses year-end 2019
varies between up to 6 years (EUR 82 million) and up to 8 years (EUR 168 million).
Consolidation of structured entities
The consolidation of structured entities is a critical estimate that requires judgement and is described
in note 53.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Segment report
Segment information is presented in these consolidated financial statements on the same basis as
used for internal management reporting within NIBC. Segment reporting puts forth a presentation of
the segment results based on management reporting methods and a reconciliation between the
results of the operating segments and the consolidated financial statements. The Managing Board is
the Group's chief operating decision-maker.
Operating segments
The operating segments are as follows:
Corporate client offering
Corporate client offering provides advice and debt, mezzanine and equity financing solutions to mid-
sized companies and entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Sectors in which NIBC
is specialised are: Financial Sponsors, Fintech, Infrastructure, Life Sciences, Food Mobility and
Manufacturing, Offshore Energy, Commercial Real Estate, Technology and Shipping.
Retail client offering
Retail client offering offers savings products and mortgages to consumers who are seeking to actively
manage their financial objectives. Savings products are offered in the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium, and mortgages are offered in the Netherlands. We also offer brokerage services in Germany
under our label 'NIBC Direct.'
Treasury and Group Functions
Treasury and Group functions includes the bank's treasury function, asset and liability management,
risk management and the bank's Corporate Centre which includes HR & Corporate
Communications, Internal Audit, Legal & Compliance, Sustainability, Operations & Facilities,
Technology, and Finance, Tax & Strategy. A substantial part of the operating expenses as well as the
full time equivalents of Group Functions are allocated to corporate and retail client offering.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above-mentioned segments. Transfer
prices between operating segments are at an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions
with third parties.
Certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to Corporate client offering and Retail client
offering as they are managed on a group basis. These financial assets and liabilities are held within the
segment Treasury and Group functions and mainly comprise cash, debt investments, derivative assets
and liabilities as well as majority of the holding's funding. As the assets of Corporate client offering
and Retail client offering are largely funded internally with transfer pricing, the majority of NIBC's
external funding is held within Treasury and Group functions.
Inter-segment income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation level.
Reconciliation with consolidated income statement
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in our Accounting Policies
section.
NIBC operates in four geographical locations namely the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Belgium.
The income and expenses incurred at each location are disclosed in a separate table.

The development in 2019 net interest income compared to 2018 decreased with EUR 15 million to
a level of EUR 417 million. The developments in the NIBC's segments are as follows:
■ Net interest income of the Corporate client segment decreased by EUR 17 million to
EUR 185 million, following only a minor decrease in the drawn portfolio. This result reflects
NIBC's effort to rebalance the portfolio, in which reduction of exposure in specific sub portfolios
is offset by growth in other, targeted product market combinations;
■ In the Retail client segment, net interest income increased with EUR 7 million to EUR 137 million.
This increase follows from the portfolio growth and hedge accounting, offset for a part by the
decreased portfolio spread;
■ The Treasury & Group functions report net interest income of EUR 95 million, an decrease of
EUR 6 million.
Interest income includes negative interest from liabilities for an amount of EUR 21 million (2018:
EUR 28 million).
For the year ended 31 December 2019, interest expense related to deposits from customers
amounted to EUR 74 million (31 December 2018: EUR 88 million).
Interest expense includes negative interest from financial assets for an amount of EUR 48 million
(2018: EUR 76 million).

Fair value hedges of interest risk rate increased from a loss of EUR 6 million in 2018 to a loss of
EUR 7 million in 2019 and can be attributed to a gain of EUR 129 million on the hedged items (2018:
gain of EUR 21 million) and a loss of EUR 136 million on the hedging instruments (2018: loss of
EUR 27 million).
Interest rate instruments (economic hedge) resulted in a gain of EUR 3 million (2018: a loss of
EUR 1 million), mainly related to CVA adjustments and the Cross currency swaps.
Debt securities report a gain of EUR 1 million, related to repurchased securities (2018:
EUR 1 million).
Loans report a gain of EUR 1 million, which includes EUR 9 million positive revaluations and EUR 8
negative revaluations, related to several corporate loans recorded at fair value.
Currency revaluations have led to a gain of EUR 4 million (2018: gain of EUR 5 million) on foreign
exchange.

1 NIBC decided to reclassify costs of external advisors not yet considered as temporary staff - in 2018 amounting to approximately EUR 9 million - as
part of salaries as from 2019. Therefore the comparable figures 2018 were changed accordingly
FTEs
The number of FTEs increased from 657 at 31 December 2018 to 667 at 31 December 2019. The
average employed number of FTEs increased from 658 in 2018 to 659 in 2019. The number of FTEs
employed outside of the Netherlands decreased from 119 at 31 December 2018 to 107 at
31 December 2019.
Salaries
Salaries in 2019 includes an amount of EUR 2.5 million for a one-off expense due to various staff
changes in the organisational structure during 2019 (2018: EUR 4.3 million).
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 191
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Severance payments
The decision to dismantle NIBC's capital markets activities will result in a reduction of 49 employees.
The positive advise from the Work Council has been received on this restructuring in the beginning
of 2020. NIBC's Social Protocol 2019, which specifies the redundancy compensation package, is
applicable for all redundant employees. The total staff reduction costs provided for in this regard in
2019 amounts to EUR 7.3 million.
Variable compensation
The variable compensation in cash charged to the income statement increased in 2019 by
EUR 1.0 million. The total amount of variable income paid in 2019, with respect to the performance
over 2018, amounts to EUR 7.9 million. The decrease in variable compensation paid in 2019 in
comparison with the amount paid in 2018 is due to the one-off retention package in April 2018
granted to members of the Executive Committee (ExCo). In 2019, partly as a consequence of the
second tranche of the granted one-off retention package, three employees were awarded a total
compensation of more than EUR 1 million (2018: six employees, as a consequence of the first
tranche of the granted one-off retention package).
As per 23 March 2018, the date of the initial public offering of NIBC, a one-off retention package of
in total EUR 5.4 million (gross) was granted to the six members of the ExCo. The net amount after
income tax was invested in Common Depositary Receipts (CDRs) by the ExCo-members with a
standard lock-up period of five years on 23 March 2018 (first tranche of 60%) and 23 March 2019
(second tranche of 40%) respectively. The first tranche has been unconditionally awarded to the
ExCo members on the IPO date. The second tranche was unconditionally awarded to the ExCo-
members on 23 March 2019.
As a consequence of the standard lock-up period of five years the ExCo-members are entitled to a
fiscal discount of 18,5% of the share price at the investment date, i.e. on 23 March 2018 and on
23 March 2019 respectively. The one-off retention package related total fiscal discount that will be
carried by NIBC amounts to EUR 0.6 million. The total expenses related to this one-off retention
package amounts to EUR 0.6 million in 2019 (2018: 5.1 million).
Information on the pension charges is included in note 37 Provisions.

Components of variable compensation - NIBC Choice
NIBC Choice is NIBC's share-based and deferred compensation plan and governs all variable
compensation components in the form of equity, equity-related and deferred cash compensation. In
addition to this, variable compensation can consist of a discretionary short-term cash bonus. NIBC
Choice is only open to management and employees and includes conditions relating to termination of
employment or certain corporate events, such as restructurings, affecting the rights that would
otherwise accrue to them.
The following table gives an overview of the different existing NIBC Choice instruments and their
main characteristics:

Depositary receipts
The Depositary Receipts (DRs), consisting of CDRs and RDRs, are issued by Stichting
Administratiekantoor NIBC (the Foundation) in accordance with its relevant conditions of
administration (administratievoorwaarden). Prior to the IPO the conditions of administration have
been slightly adjusted to declare a generic lock-up period of six months for holders of DRs. The
generic lock-up period of six months ended on 23 September 2018 (i.e. six months after the IPO).
The Foundation issues a DR for each ordinary share it holds in NIBC. The Foundation exercises the
voting rights in respect of each of these ordinary shares at its own discretion, unless holders of DRs
request a power of attorney from the Foundation to vote in respect of our ordinary shares, except
for DRs obtained under the one-off retention package (ExCo) not entitled to the dividends and
other distributions declared payable in respect of the underlying ordinary share.
Under the conditions of administration, the holders of DRs have pre-emption rights similar to other
shareholders of NIBC, subject to the Foundation having been given pre-emptive rights. Consequently,
when given these pre-emptive rights, the Foundation will exercise the pre-emption rights attached to
the ordinary shares underlying the DRs if these holders so elect.
In 2009 a co-investment programme was introduced for Statutory Board members. Under this
programme Statutory Board members were granted matching shares (CRDRs), subject to a four-year
vesting period, on a net after-tax basis representing a 1:1 match to their personal investment in CDRs
at that time. These matching shares will become fully unconditional and vest immediately upon
change of control of NIBC. In December 2017 it was proposed by the Statutory Board and
subsequently approved by the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board to
change the Plan Rules Variable Compensation (NIBC Choice) in order to allow delivery of DRs for
outstanding CCDRs in lieu of the occurrence of a change of control of NIBC. Furthermore it was
decided that all unvested CRDRs outstanding at 1 January 2018 vested immediately (accelerated
vesting) into CCDRs. This applied to 3.558 CRDRs (net after tax basis) related to the cancellation of
the Long Term Incentive arrangement for certain Statutory Board members. Following this change of
the Plan Rules 317,200 (net after tax basis) outstanding CCDRs were released into CDRs in January
2018.
194 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of 1 January 2015 a short-term variable income component at target of 15% of base salary (with
a maximum of 20%) is applicable for Statutory Board members. The variable compensation is
delivered in a pre-defined mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in PSUs and 20% in RPSUs.
One-off retention package ExCo members
On 23 March 2018, the date of the IPO, NIBC granted a retention package of DRs to the members
of the ExCo. For Statutory Board members of the ExCo, the monetary value of the retention
package was set at 180 per cent of their fixed annual gross salary. At that time the fixed annual gross
salary was EUR 825,000 for the CEO and EUR 600,000 for each of the CFO and CRO, therefore the
gross monetary value of the retention package was EUR 1,485,000 for the CEO and EUR 1,080,000
for each of the CFO and CRO. For non-statutory members of the ExCo, the monetary value of the
retention package was set at 165 per cent of their fixed annual gross salary. The fixed annual gross
salary for each of the non-statutory members of the ExCo was EUR 350,000 and therefore the gross
monetary value of the retention package was EUR 577,500.
Under the one-off retention package, DRs were granted and will be vested for dividend eligibility in
accordance with a predifined vesting schedule.
The number of DRs is calculated by converting the gross monetary amount of the retention package
into the number of DRs corresponding to ordinary shares at the initial offering price of EUR 8.75.
The number of DRs issued pursuant to the retention package awarded at the first anniversary of the
IPO date was calculated by converting the gross monetary amount of the retention package into the
number of DRs corresponding to the ordinary shares at the listed share price at 23 March 2019 of
EUR 8.01. In addition, for a period of five years from the date of award, being either the IPO date or
the first anniversary thereof, the members of the ExCo may not dispose of any DRs received
pursuant to the retention package. The lock-up period cannot be waived and the retention package
arrangement does not provide for any circumstances which may result in automatic waiver of the
lock-up period. Following the expiry of the applicable lock-up period, the ExCo member (i) may
request the Foundation to convert the DRs into ordinary shares and transfer the ordinary shares to a
third party investment account; or (iii) may offer all or part of their entire holding of DRs for sale to
the Foundation against cancellation of such DRs with the sale being settled in cash and the value of
the cash payments being calculated by multiplying the number of DRs cancelled by the price of one
ordinary share on Euronext Amsterdam as at the date of cancellation. After the lock-up period of
five years, the underlying shares of the DRs will be delivered by the STAK to the personal securities
accounts of the ExCo members or the underlying shares of the DRs will be sold on the stock
exchange on behalf of the respective ExCo member.
The retention package is subject to the holdback and claw back provisions as set out in the
remuneration policy of NIBC and as set out in article 2:135 of the Dutch Civil Code and article 1:126
and 1:127 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.
Depositary Receipts Purchase Plan (DRPP)
In view of the IPO at 23 March 2018 and at the first anniversary of the IPO in 2019 (for practical
reasons set at 1 April 2019), all employees of NIBC (for 2018 including members of Statutory Board
and other members of the Executive Committee) were offered an opportunity to participate in the
DRPP to purchase CDRs in the company.
The ExCo and staff members of NIBC are entitled to a tax discount between 5.5 per cent and 18.5
per cent on the initial offering price at 23 March 2018 and the listed share price at 1 April 2019,
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 195
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
corresponding with a lock-up period for disposal between one and five years. The related tax
expense of EUR 0.1 million (2018: EUR 1.0 million) is borne by NIBC.
Phantom Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Phantom Share Units (RPSUs)
The short-term compensation in share-related awards consists of PSUs and/or RPSUs. RPSU awards
are subject to a three-year vesting with one third vesting each year on 1 April. All PSUs and RPSUs
are subject to a one-year retention period as measured from the date of vesting. For the Statutory
Board the lock-up period of the equity-linked instruments is five years. The RPSUs and PSUs have
similar characteristics as the CRDR, such as eligibility for dividend and a value which is tied to
movements in the net asset value of NIBC Holding, however RPSUs are not eligible for dividend.
After the IPO the fair value is based on the listed share price of NIBC Holding. This short-term
compensation can be converted into cash immediately after the retention period and therefore is
recognised as cash-settled.

Result recognition
With respect to all instruments relating to NIBC Choice (CDRs, CCDRs, CRDRs, PSUs, RPSUs and
deferred cash), an amount of EUR 2 million was expensed through personnel expenses in 2019
(2018: EUR 8 million), of which nil (2018: EUR 2 million) refers to cash-settled
instruments (deferred cash and vested PSUs) and EUR 2 million (2018: EUR 6 million) to equity-
settled instruments (including fiscal discount borne by NIBC related to one-off retention package
granted to the ExCo members in 2018 and the DRPP 2019 and 2018).
With respect to the cash-settled instruments (PSUs, RPSUs and deferred cash), the amount
expensed during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of
instruments originally granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at balance sheet date,
the vesting period and estimates of the number of instruments that will forfeit during the remaining
vesting period. The liability in the balance sheet with respect to cash-settled instruments is
EUR 5 million (2018: EUR 5 million).
With respect to the equity-settled instruments (CDRs), the amount expensed during the vesting
period through the income statement is based on the number of instruments granted outstanding at
balance sheet date, their fair value at grant date, the vesting period and estimates of the number of
instruments that will forfeit during the remaining vesting period. The liability in the balance sheet
relating to the cumulative expenses with respect to equity-settled instruments is nil (2018:
EUR 2 million).
The current account position with NIBC Holding includes a receivable related to the capital
contribution paid to NIBC Bank in relation to the granted equity settled NIBC Holding's share-based
instruments (NIBC Choice) by NIBC Holding. The share-based expenses are borne by NIBC Bank
and the after payroll tax amounts were paid to the Foundation with subsequent delivery of CDRs
and/or RDRs by the Foundation to the employees.

The changes in fair value in the previous table reflect movements due to both interest rate changes
and credit spread changes. As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets, the movement
due to interest rate changes is compensated by results on financial derivatives.
The cumulative change in fair value included in the balance sheet amount (at fair value through profit
or loss) attributable to changes in interest rates and credit risk amounts to a loss of EUR 20 million
(2018: loss of EUR 21 million).
The portion of fair value changes in 2019 included in the balance sheet amount (at fair value through
profit or loss) as at 31 December 2019 relating to the movement in credit spreads amounted to nil
(2018: nil).
The maximum credit risk for this portfolio exposure including undrawn credit facilities amounted to
EUR 188 million (2018: EUR 187 million).
The maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of any collateral or other credit
enhancement for this financial asset amounts to EUR 188 million as per 31 December 2019 (2018:
EUR 187 million). This credit risk exposure is mitigated by the collateral held as security and other
credit enhancements on these assets, for which the fair value amounts as per 31 December 2019 to
EUR 142 million (2018: EUR 148 million).

Derivative financial assets and liabilities used for hedge accounting are derivatives designated in hedge
accounting relationships as defined in IAS 39. The derivatives financial assets and liabilities in the
category 'other' are classified as held for trading.
Derivative financial assets used for hedge accouting are settled to market (STM). Derivative financial
assets other are Over The Counter (OTC).
The derivatives consist of:
■ Interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of the mortgage portfolio;
■ Interest rate swaps to transform fixed rate funding into floating rate funding;
■ FX and cross-currency swaps to fund the non-euro loans to customers or to transform non-euro
funding into euros;
■ Client-driven derivative transactions;
■ Limited money market trading.
Economically all these derivatives, with the exception of the limited money market trading and client-
driven transactions, are used to hedge interest rate or FX risk. The limited money market trading is
controlled by a facilitating VAR limit of EUR 2.25 million. For further details see note 57 Market risk
(Key risk statistics Trading portfolio excluding NIBC Markets).
Derivatives used for hedging are asigned in a hedge accounting relationship and can be ineffective.
Sources of ineffectiveness are the behaviour of the curve shift, the volatility of the basis spread over
the curve and the distribution of cash flows of assets and liabilities compared to the hedging
derivatives.

Portfolio fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC 's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by the Asset & Liability Committee
(ALCO). Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk
212 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a
portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging
transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2019 was nil (2018: EUR 7 million debit). The losses on the hedging
instruments were nil (2018: loss of EUR 1 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the
hedged risk were nil (2018: gain of EUR 1 million). Differences between the results recognised on the
hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Portfolio fair value hedge of Assets & Liabilities
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate asset and liability activities such as mortgages and retail deposits above certain limits prescribed
by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk
arising on these primarily fixed rate mortgages and retail deposits. To mitigate any accounting
mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the assets and liabilities with a
contractual duration longer than three months and the corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2019 was EUR 3 million credit (2018: EUR 1 million debit). The losses
on the hedging instruments were EUR 137 million (2018: loss of EUR 34 million). The gains on the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 144 million (2018: gain of EUR 41 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness and pipeline hedging. The pipeline consists of mortgage loans
offered to customers but not yet have been accepted.
Micro fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC 's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate and foreign
exchange risk from its fixed rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk on this
fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge
for fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2019 was EUR 4 million debit (2018: EUR 5 million debit). The gains
on the hedging instruments were EUR 2 million (2018: gain of EUR 11 million). The losses on the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 1 million (2018: loss of EUR 15 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Portfolio fair value hedge of loans
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its
corporate loan activities above certain limits as set by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate
swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising from these fixed rate loans. To mitigate any
accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate loan and
corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
hedge relationships at 31 December 2019 was nil (2018: EUR 5 million credit). Gains on the hedging
instruments were EUR 2 million (2018: gain of EUR 1 million). The losses on the hedged items
attributable to the hedged risk were nil (2018: nil). Differences between the results recognised on the
hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Micro fair value hedge accounting of the Liquidity portfolio debt investments
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to fair value interest rate risk from
its fixed rate debt investments held in the Liquidity portfolios above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising
on this fixed rate debt investments. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a
micro fair value hedge for fixed rate debt investments and corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2019 was nil. (2018: nil). The losses on the hedging instruments were
nil (2018: nil). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were nil (2018: nil).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Cash flow hedges
NIBC has classified a large part of its corporate loans as loans and receivables at amortised cost.
Therefore, variability in the cash flows of the floating rate corporate loans is accounted for in future
periods, when the coupons are recorded in the income statement on an amortised cost basis.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the floating cash flows of its floating corporate loans. These
swaps are reported at fair value through profit or loss. This accounting mismatch creates volatility in
the income statement of NIBC. Therefore NIBC applies hedge accounting on these positions. Hedge
accounting is applied to all swaps that are used to hedge the cash flow risk of the floating corporate
loans by defining a macro cash flow hedge relationship with the floating corporate loans.
The variability in interest cash flows arising on floating rate corporate loans is hedged on a portfolio
basis with interest rate swaps that receive fixed and pay floating (generally one, three and six months
floating rates). The highly probable cash flows being hedged relate both to the highly probable cash
flows on outstanding corporate loans and to the future reinvestment of these cash flows. NIBC does
not hedge the variability of future cash flows of corporate loans arising from changes in credit
spreads.
214 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Interest rate swaps with a net fair value of nil (2018: nil) were designated in a cash flow hedge
relationship. The cash flow on the hedged item will be reported in income over the next six years. In
2019 the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arose from cash flow hedges was a
loss of EUR 3 million (2018: loss of EUR 1 million).
Some macro cash flow hedging relationships ceased to exist during 2019 and therefore the related
cumulative hedge adjustment as from that date, is being amortised over the remaining contractual
maturity of the hedged item.
The amount that was recognised in equity for the year 2019 was EUR 3 million credit (2018:
EUR 2 million debit). The amount that was transferred from equity to the income statement in 2019
was a loss of EUR 6 million net of tax (2018: gain of EUR 12 million).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured for all temporary differences using the liability

Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carry forward losses can only be utilized if taxable profits
are realised in the future. To measure deferred tax assets, NIBC takes a management best estimate
regarding future compensation of carry forward losses. On 31 December 2019 there was a realistic
expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be generated within the applicable periods for the
recognised deferred tax asset based on internal (medium term) forecasts.

Obligations and expense under pension plans
A collective defined-contribution plan (CDC-plan) is a pension plan under which NIBC each year
pays a fixed percentage of the salaries of the members into the scheme. The size of the fund on
retirement will be determined by how much was contributed to the scheme and the investment
return achieved.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 241
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For defined-contribution plans, NIBC pays contributions directly into the member's scheme. NIBC
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The CDC-plan is based on an average salary plan. The retirement age is set at 68 years as per
1 January 2018. The contribution payable by participants in the CDC-plan is maximised at 4% per
annum. Under the CDC-plan the annual pension contributions are calculated according to a fixed
contribution calculation mechanism. The annual pension contribution of NIBC is maximised at 26% of
the pensionable salary (salary minus a social security deductible). By paying the agreed fixed annual
contribution NIBC Holding is released from all its obligations.

The capital securities are perpetual and have no expiry date. The distribution on the Capital
Securities issued in September 2017 is as follows: the coupon is 6% per year and is made payable
every six months in arrears as of the issue date (29 September 2017), for the first time on 29 March
2018. The capital securities are perpetual and first redeemable on 29 September 2026. As of
29 September 2026, and subject to capital securities not being redeemed early, the distribution is set
for a further five-year period, but without a step-up, based on the 5 year euro swap rate +5.564 %.
Any payments including coupon payments are fully discretionary.
The principal amount of the capital securities will be written down if the CET1 ratio of NIBC falls
below 5.125%. Following such reduction, the principal amount may, at NIBC's discretion, be written-
up to the original principal amount if certain conditions are met. In addition, the capital securities may
be subject to a permanent write-down or conversion into equity in circumstances where the
competent resolution authority would determine that NIBC has reached the point of non-viability or
the occurrence of a bail-in.

45.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data
45.12 Fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value
45.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
45.1 Valuation principles
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current
market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using a valuation technique.
In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a
hierarchy of valuation techniques, as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
45.2 Valuation governance
NIBC’s fair value methodology and the governance over its models includes a number of controls and
other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All
new product initiatives (including their valuation methodologies) are subject to approvals by various
functions of NIBC including the Risk and Finance functions. Once submitted, fair value estimates are
also reviewed and challenged by the Risk and Finance functions.
45.3 Financial instruments by fair value hierarchy
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to
initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the
degree to which the fair value is observable:

45.4 Valuation techniques
The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments that are
recorded at fair value using either quoted prices or valuation techniques. These incorporate NIBC's
interpretation of valuation assumptions (qualitative) that a market participant would consider when
valuing the instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Debt investments - level 1
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2019, NIBC used market-observable prices.
NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Equity investments - level 1
The level 1 portfolio consists of unadjusted, quoted prices for assets in an active market. The assets
have been valued at the market’s closing price of 31 December 2019.
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2019, NIBC applied market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Loans - level 2 and 3
In an active market environment, these assets are marked-to-market by applying market bid quotes
observed on the secondary market. The quotes received from other banks or brokers and applied in
the marked-to-market process are calibrated to actual market trades whenever possible.
In certain instances, where the market is inactive, a discounted cash flow model is used based on
various assumptions including market interest rates, market credit spread levels and assumptions
regarding market liquidity, where relevant. Additional pricing reference points have been obtained by
collecting spreads using primary transactions that are comparable with the relevant loans.
Derivatives financial assets and liabilities (held for trading and used for hedging) - level 2
Derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs are mainly
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The most
frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The
models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange rates, credit spread levels and interest
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 251
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
rate curves. Credit derivative valuation models also require input as to the estimated probability of
default and recovery value.
Debt investments - level 3
For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis
that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates
and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market
liquidity discounts.
Equity investments (including investments in associates) - level 3
The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by
the managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to
ascertain that the reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value
principles as part of a robust process.
The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable
earnings. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ EBITDA.
Capitalisation multiples are derived from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months
EBITDA. On each reporting date, the capitalisation multiple of each equity investment is compared
against those derived from the publicly available enterprise value and earnings information of traded
peers, where these can be identified. Peer capitalisation multiples are normalised for factors such as
differences in regional and economic environment, time lags in earnings information and one-off gains
and losses.
The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and
management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Debt investments - level 1
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2019, NIBC used market-observable prices
(including broker quotes). NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time,
ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations.
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2019, NIBC used market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (including trading)
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - level 2
This portfolio was designated at fair value through profit or loss and is reported on the face of the
balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Own debt securities in issue (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
■ Debt securities in issue structured (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
■ Subordinated liabilities (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss).
252 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Debt securities in issue structured consist of notes issued with embedded derivatives that are tailored
to specific investors’ needs. The return on these notes is dependent upon the level of certain
underlying equity, interest rate, currency, credit, commodity or inflation-linked indices. The embedded
derivative within each note issued is fully hedged on a back-to-back basis, such that effectively
synthetic floating rate funding is created. Because of this economic hedge, the income statement is
not sensitive to fluctuations in the price of these indices.
In the case of debt securities in issue structured and subordinated liabilities, the fair value of the notes
issued and the back-to-back hedging swaps is determined using valuation models developed by a
third party employing Monte Carlo simulation, lattice valuations or closed formulas, depending on the
type of embedded derivative. These models use market-observable inputs (e.g. interest rates, equity
prices) for valuation of these structures.
For each class of own financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the expected cash flows
are discounted to present value using interbank zero-coupon rates. The resulting fair value is adjusted
for movements in the credit spread applicable to NIBC issued funding.
45.5 Valuation adjustments and other inputs and considerations
Credit and debit valuation adjustments
NIBC calculates CVA/DVA (as defined in Critical accounting estimates and judgements) on a
counterparty basis over the entire life of the exposure.
Bid-offer
NIBC's pricing models initially calculate mid-market prices, which are subsequently adjusted to reflect
bid-offer spreads (the difference between prices quoted for sales and purchases). NIBC Markets
pricing models use bid prices. As of the 31st December 2019, NIBC is able to retrieve only bid prices
from our independent sources. Thus, a mid-bid adjustment is not relevant anymore.
Day-1 profit
A Day-1 profit, representing the difference between the transaction price and the fair value output of
internal models, is recognised when the inputs to the valuation models are observable data market
data.

45.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data.
Given the wide range of diverse investments and the correspondingly large differences in prices,
NIBC does not disclose the ranges as it believes it would not provide meaningful information without
a full list of the underlying investments, which would be impractical.

Non-listed equity investments
Level 3 equity securities mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity
securities which are not traded in active markets. In the absence of an active market, fair values are
estimated on the analysis of fund manager reports, company's financial position and other factors.
Discount spreads
Discount spread is the spread above a market interest rate, based on Euribor, which is used to
discount the projected cash flows. The discount spread is derived from residential mortgage market
quotes of lenders in the Dutch residential mortgage market after deduction of relevant upfront costs.
Expected sales prices underlying assets
The fair value of the loans available for sale is highly dependent on the projected sales prices of the
underlying assets. The lower level assumes actual sales prices of 75% of the projected sales prices the
higher level assumes actual salesprices of 125%.
Price
For securities where market prices are not available fair value is measured by comparison with
observable pricing data from similar instruments. Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no
recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay the
estimated yield.
45.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data
The following table shows the impact on the fair value of level 3 instruments of using reasonably
possible alternative assumptions by class of instrument:

Loans 34 2 49 3
In order to determine the reasonably possible alternative assumptions, NIBC adjusted key
unobservable valuation technique inputs as follows:
■ For the debt investments, NIBC adjusted the weighted average calculated model price by 100
basis points as a reasonably possible alternative outcome. The primary unobservable input in the
calculated model price is the applicable credit spread;
■ For equity investments, the material unobservable input parameters, such as capitalisation multiple,
that are applied to the maintainable earnings to determine fair value are adjusted by 5%;
■ For loans, the sensitivity in unobservable input parameters, such as the change in discount factor
due to macro economic developments, company specific risk profile and yield offer vs. demand in
sector is determined as 5%.
In 2019, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affect the
fair value of the NIBC's financial assets and liabilities and there were no reclassifications of financial
assets.
45.12 Fair value information on financial instruments not measured at fair value

The fair value disclosed for the mortgage loans is based on the retail spread. The retail spread in turn
is determined by comparing mortgage quotes of Dutch mortgage lenders to the risk free curve and
subsequently deducting the appropriate upfront costs.
NIBC determines the fair value of mortgage loans (both those it holds in part of its own warehouse
and those it has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. This model discounts
expected cash flows to present value using inter-bank zero-coupon rates, adjusted for a spread that
principally takes into account the costs and the risks of the assets. Subsequently NIBC calculates a
discount spread via a top-down approach.
The top-down approach derives a discount spread by taking into account the mortgage rates of
newly originated loans in the consumer market. The offered mortgage rate is determined by
collecting mortgage rates from other professional lenders sorted by product, loan-to-value class and
the fixed-rate period. The discount spread is derived by comparing the offered mortgage rate to the
market interest rates taking into account various upfront costs embedded in the offered mortgage
rate. Where deemed necessary, surcharges are added to reflect the illiquidity of certain sub-
portfolios.
Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are carried at amounts that
approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These
financial instruments include cash and balances with central banks, due from other banks, due to
other banks, deposits from customers and other financial liabilities. These financial instruments are
not included in the previous table.
45.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
Until year end 2018 NIBC's land and buildings were valued at fair value through equity
(31 December 2018: carrying amount EUR 42 million). On 1 January 2019 part of the land and
buildings were reclassified from property and equipment to investment property, based on the actual
change in its use (i.e. a transfer of a significant part to the available-for-rental status). Just before this
reclassification land and buildings were revalued as of 1 January 2019 based on independent external
appraisal.
NIBC's land and buildings (for-own-use) are valued at fair value through equity, the carrying amount
(level 3) at 31 December 2019 is EUR 30 million.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 259
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NIBC's investment property (available-for-rental) are valued at fair value through profit or loss, the
carrying amount (level 3) at 31 December 2019 is EUR 23 million. The fair value of the right-of-use
assets does not materially deviate from the carrying amount.

47 Repurchase and resale agreements and transferred financial assets
NIBC has a programme to borrow and lend securities and to sell securities under agreements to
repurchase (‘repos’) and to purchase securities under agreements to resell (‘reverse repos’). The
securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase are transferred to a third party and NIBC
receives cash, or other financial assets in exchange. The counterparty is allowed to sell or repledge
those securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements in the absence of default by NIBC, but has
an obligation to return the securities at the maturity of the contract. These transactions are
conducted under terms based on the applicable ISDA Collateral Guidelines. If the securities increase
or decrease in value, NIBC may in certain circumstances, require, or be required, to pay additional
cash collateral. NIBC has determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of these
securities and therefore has not derecognised them. In addition, it recognises a financial liability for
cash received as collateral.
Similarly NIBC may sell or repledge any securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to
resell, but has an obligation to return the securities and the counterparty retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership. Consequently the securities are not recognised by NIBC, which
instead records a separate asset for the cash collateral given.
NIBC conducts these transactions under terms agreed in Global Master Repurchase Agreements. As
per year-end 2019 NIBC did not have any repurchase and resale agreement related positions as
described in this note (2018: nil).
Transferred financial assets
This disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and
associated financial liabilities in order to understand which risks NIBC is exposed to when the assets
are transferred.
If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised on the balance sheet, NIBC is still exposed to
changes in the fair value of the assets.
Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety

RMBS programme
NIBC uses securitisations as a source of funding whereby the Structured Entity (SE) issues debt
securities. Pursuant to a securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, NIBC transfers the title
of the assets to SEs. When the cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by
consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (residential mortgage loans) are considered to be
transferred.
The Covered Bond programme
Under NIBC's Covered Bond programme, notes are issued by NIBC from its own balance sheet.
Bond holders are protected from suffering a loss even in the event that NIBC defaults because at the
point the notes were issued, NIBC also transferred the legal title of a portfolio of mortgages to a SE
to act as collateral for the covered bond investors. From a legal perspective, the SE guarantees the
repayment of the Covered Bonds. The title transfer of the mortgages has been achieved by NIBC
providing an inter-company loan on the same terms and conditions as the external bonds to the SE.
The SE used the proceeds to purchase the mortgage portfolio. The net result is that the SE retains
the legal title, but proceeds from the mortgages are passed through the intercompany loan to the
covered bond holders. NIBC consolidates the SE on the basis that, in addition to having power as the
sole owner, NIBC also is entitled to substantial variable returns through the over-collateralised
portion of the sold mortgages.
Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets that are derecognised in their
entirety
NIBC does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where
NIBC has continuing involvement.
48 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-
interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.

These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC’s policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 55 Credit risk.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 265
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contingent liabilities related to income tax
The European Commission has addressed questions related to the Dutch Government about article
29a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code. If the European Commission would decide to start a
formal investigation and ultimately would conclude that this is a case of state aid, NIBC may have to
repay tax benefits it enjoyed on the coupon payments. Article 29a of the Dutch Corporate Income
Tax Code was included in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code so that capital instruments issued
by credit institutions and which are covered by EU regulation 575/2013 would be considered tax
deductible. In this context NIBC issued Capital Securities in September 2017, amounting
EUR 200 million at a fixed interest rate of 6%. The contingent liability related to this matter started at
the (fully discretionary) first coupon payment date (March 2018).
Article 29a has been abolished as of January 1, 2019. This limits any state aid exposure to coupon
payments made during the time period September 2017 up to and including December 2018.
Claims, investigations, litigation or other proceedings or actions may have a
material adverse effect on NIBC’s business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.
NIBC is involved in a number of proceedings and settlement negotiations with customers,
counterparties, current or former employees or others arising in the ordinary course of business.
Proceedings may relate to, for example, alleged violations of NIBC’s duty of care (zorgplicht) vis-a-vis
its (former) customers, the provision of allegedly inadequate investment advice or the provision of
allegedly inadequate services. Negative publicity associated with certain sales practices, compensation
payable in respect of such issues or regulatory changes resulting from such issues could have a
material adverse effect on NIBC’s reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. Dutch financial services providers are increasingly exposed to collective claims from
groups of customers or consumer organisations seeking damages for an unspecified or indeterminate
amount or involving unprecedented legal claims in respect of assumed mis-selling or other violations
of law or customer rights.
While NIBC has made considerable investment in reviewing and assessing historic sales and “know
your customer' practices and in the maintenance of risk management, legal and compliance
procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be no assurance that all of the issues
associated with current and historic sales practices have been or will be identified, nor that any issues
already identified will not be more widespread than presently estimated. Assessments of the
likelihood of claims arising from former activities are often difficult to accurately assess, due to the
difficulties in applying more recent standards or court judgements to past practices. Furthermore
many individual transactions are heavily fact-specific and the likelihood of applicability to more
transactions of a court decision received on one particular transaction, is difficult to predict until a
claim actually materialises and is elaborated. Changes in customer protection regulations and in
interpretation and perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable
market practices might also influence client expectations. One example of past practice that is
currently being subjected to a review of the correctness of such behaviour relates to EURIBOR-based
mortgages. In 2017 NIBC acquired a portfolio of mortgages and, as part of such acquisition, took
over a number of such EURIBOR-based mortgages. Such types of mortgages are currently the
subject of individual and class action claims towards another financial institution within the
Netherlands. The claimants have been contesting the contractual right of such mortgage lender to
have adjusted the margin and alleged that the mortgage lender violated its duty of care towards the
relevant customers. Recently, the Surpreme Court found in favour of such financial institution and
referred the case back to the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam. Given the similarity of the facts to the
EURIBOR-based mortgages within the portfolio acquired by NIBC, NIBC is monitoring such
266 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
developments and has notified the relevant clients that it will apply the outcome of these court
proceedings to the EURIBOR-based loans acquired by NIBC. The risks related to this legal issue were
taken into account at the time of acquisition of this mortgage portfolio and factored into the
consideration paid by NIBC at the time. Recently, a settlement has been agreed between the parties
to that litigation. NIBC is currently examining that settlement with a view to deciding next steps
towards its own affected clients, given such settlement and therefore absence of a final court
outcome.
On 18 February, 2020 NIBC received inquiries from Vereniging van Effectenbezitters (VEB)
concerning NIBC Holding N.V.’s share price developments and associated trading volumes in relation
to the announced firm proposal from Blackstone on 14 February, 2020.
It is difficult for NIBC to predict the outcome of many of the pending or future claims, regulatory
proceedings and other adversarial proceedings. The costs and staffing capacity required to defend
against future actions may be significant. Counterparties in these proceedings may also seek publicity,
over which NIBC will have no control, and this publicity could lead to reputational harm to NIBC and
potentially decrease customer acceptance of NIBC’s services, regardless of whether the allegations
are valid or whether NIBC is ultimately found liable. In addition, NIBC’s provisions for defending these
claims may not be sufficient.
On the basis of legal advice and taking into consideration the facts known at present, NIBC is of the
opinion that the outcome of these proceedings is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position and consolidated results.

transactions with JC Flowers Fund IV are at arm's length.
In November 2019, NIBC supported Reggeborgh in the envisaged public offer for VolkerWessels.
NIBC acted as financial advisor to the shareholders of Reggeborgh and provided the debt financing in
which Reggeborgh has the ability to draw down debt for an amount of EUR 200 million
(EUR 75 million drawn as per 31 December 2019).
In 2015, NIBC made a commitment of USD 10 million to 'Flowers Fund IV'and in 2016 NIBC made
an additional commitment of USD 5 million to 'Flowers Fund III' bringing the total commitment in this
fund to USD 15 million. Both funds are managed by an affiliate of J.C. Flowers & Co.
At 2 November 2018 NIBC committed to a co-investment of EUR 30 million in HSH Nordbank
along with the 'Flowers Fund IV'. NIBC's exposure to HSH Nordbank is EUR 30 million. Due to the
existing relationship with the J.C. Flowers Funds a waiver has been obtained for certain fees.
In 2018, EUR 7 million fee related to the purchase of HSH Nordbank by a consortium led by J.C.
Flowers Funds, where NIBC acted as the M&A advisor for the buyer has been received.

Significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the scope of the consolidation
Determining whether NIBC has control of an entity is generally straightforward, based on ownership
of the majority of the voting rights. However, in certain instances this determination will involve
significant judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not
the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement may involve assessing
the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether NIBC, or
another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right
or as an agent on behalf of others.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 273
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over
structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other
investors’ exposures to the structure’s variable returns have been substantively eliminated, NIBC may
conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore NIBC will
consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% (or in certain circumstances large minority
shareholding) would typically indicate that NIBC has control of an entity. However certain entities are
excluded from consolidation because NIBC does not have exposure to their variable returns and/or
are managed by external parties and consequently are not controlled by NIBC. Where appropriate,
interests relating to these entities are included in note 53 Structured entities.
See the basis of consolidation section of the Accounting policies for further information on other
factors affecting consolidation of an entity.
Significant restrictions to access or use NIBC’s assets
Legal, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests
might restrict the ability of NIBC to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within
NIBC and to settle liabilities of NIBC.
Since NIBC did not have any material non-controlling interests at the balance sheet date, any
protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.
Restrictions impacting NIBC’s ability to use assets:
■ NIBC has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities
financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative
liabilities;
■ The assets of consolidated structured entities are held for the benefit of the parties that have
bought the notes issued by these entities;
■ Regulatory and central bank requirements or local corporate legislation may restrict NIBC’s ability
to transfer assets to or from other entities within NIBC in certain jurisdictions.

53 Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined
objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
The principal use of structured entities is to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets
and to provide market liquidity for clients through securitising financial assets. Structured entities may
be established as corporations, trusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the
purchase of assets by issuing notes that are collateralised by and/or indexed to the assets held by the
structured entities. The notes issued by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of
subordination.
Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between NIBC and the
structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by NIBC, as pointed out in the
Accounting policies section Basis of consolidation. In other cases it may sponsor or have exposure to
such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in consolidated structured entities
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC primarily has contractual arrangements for securitisation vehicles which may require it to
provide financial support. NIBC uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk
transfer. At 31 December 2019, there was an outstanding junior loan commitment of EUR 12 million
(2018: nil) to these entities.
Financial support provided or to be provided to consolidated structured entities
Financial support provided or to be provided to consolidated structured entities NIBC has not
provided any non-contractual financial support during 2019 and 2018 and does not anticipate
providing non-contractual support to consolidated structured entities in the future.
Unconsolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The structured entities covered by this section are not consolidated since NIBC does not has control
them through voting rights, contract, funding agreements and/or other means. The extent of NIBC’s
interests in unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entity.
Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments,
liquidity facilities and guarantees in which NIBC is absorbing variability of returns from the structured
entities.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 277
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC establishes securitisation vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed-
income securities, corporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial, residential
and mortgage-backed assets). The securitisation vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple
tranches of notes.
Third-party fund entities
NIBC provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the
form of funding entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralised by the
asset in the structured entities. NIBC’s involvement involves predominantly equity investments.
Income derived from involvement with unconsolidated structured entities
NIBC earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment
management services in relation to funds. Interest income is recognised on the funding provided to
structured entities. Movements in the value of different types of notes held by NIBC in structured
entities are recognised in net trading income.
Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities
The maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the
unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is
reflected in their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for
off-balance sheet instruments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS
12, as interpreted by NIBC, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts do not reflect the
economic risks faced by NIBC because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or
hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred.
At 31 December 2019 off-balance sheet instruments amounts to EUR 29 million (2018:
EUR 20 million). There were no derivatives linked to structured unconsolidated entities.
Size of structured entities
NIBC provides a different measure for the size of structured entities depending on their type. The
following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of
structured entities:
■ Securitisations – notional of notes in issue when NIBC derives its interests through notes its holds
and notional of derivatives when NIBC’s interests is in the form of derivatives; and
■ Third party fund entities – total assets in entities. For third party fund entities, size information is
based on the latest available investor reports and financial statements.
Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The following table shows, by type of unconsolidated structured entity, the carrying amounts of
NIBC’s interests recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the
maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. It also provides an indication of the size of
the structured entities. The carrying amounts presented in the following table do not reflect the
maximum exposure to loss because the mitigating effects of collateral and hedges are not taken into
consideration.

Exposure to losses
NIBC’s exposure to losses related to securitisations depends on the level of subordination of the
interest which indicates the extent to which other parties are obliged to absorb credit losses before
NIBC. This is summarised in the following table. There is no significant level of subordination relating
to third-party funding.

Co-investment programme
As a result of personal investments by the Statutory Board members in 2012 and 2014 matching
shares were granted to the Statutory Board members in 2012 and 2014, in the form of CRDRs with
an after-tax value equal to the value of the personal investment made.
This offer was made to and accepted by Mr. Dijkhuizen and Mr. de Wilt when they joined the
Statutory Board.
The matching shares were subject to four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year on
1 January, but they will immediately vest upon a change of control of NIBC Holding N.V. in which
case they (i) will become fully unconditional and (ii) be legally transferred.
In December 2017 it was decided that all unvested CRDR outstanding at 1 January 2018 will vest
immediately (accelerated vesting) into CCDRs. The accelerated vesting applied to 3.558 CRDRs (net
after tax basis) related to the cancellation of the Long Term Incentive arrangement for certain
Statutory Board members. According to the change of the Plan Rules in 2017, the 70,788
outstanding CCDRs of certain Statutory Board members were released into 70,788 CDRs in January
2018.
(Restricted) Phantom Share Units
Phantom Share Units
In 2010, an equity-linked reward instrument is part of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) plan. The short-
term compensation in share-related awards consists of Phantom Share Units (PSUs) and/or Restricted
Phantom Share Units (RPSUs). RPSU awards are subject to a three-year vesting with one third vesting
each year on 1 April. The PSUs, whether vested or restricted, held by the members of the Statutory
Board are subject to a five-year retention period as measured from the date of vesting. This short-
term compensation can be converted into cash immediately after the retention period.

Table 57-1 presents the maximum credit risk exposure per portfolio, without taking collateral or any
other credit risk reduction into consideration. For all portfolios except derivatives, this is generally the
total commitment of NIBC, which also includes off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees
and undrawn credit lines.
The figures in table 57-1 are not directly comparable to the figures on the balance sheet. Mortgage
loans are recognised on the balance sheet under mortgage loans own book and securitised mortgage
loans. Debt investments (securitisations) differ from the figure on the balance sheet due to off-
balance sheet exposures as disclosed in the Risk Management notes.
NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based
(AIRB) approach for quantifying the credit quality of corporate and retail counterparties. The AIRB
methodology for corporate counterparties was approved by NIBC’s regulatory authority, the DNB, in
2008. In 2019, NIBC received an increase for RWAs on corporate exposures from the DNB pending
approval of eventual additional measures to address the model observations raised by DNB in its
Internal Model Investigation report. Furthermore, in 2019 NIBC reverted, with approval from the
DNB, back to the Standardised Approach (SA) for bank counterparties. This was done in light of the
new regulations under Basel III.

Corporate loans
Corporate loan distribution
Contrary to previous years, the tables in the Credit risk - Corporate loans note now contain both
the corporate loans and the investment loans in one section to better follow NIBC's internal business
operations. NIBC steers its business on internal Product Market Combination classification, however
it can be mapped to the industry sectors of NACE classification, if necessary. For comparability
purposes portfolio breakdown based on NACE codes is also provided in a separate document
published on NIBC’s annual report website. The change from a sector and activity view towards a
combined Product Market Combination was implemented on 1 January 2019. The 2018 amounts
have been adjusted to the portfolio structure as well to provide comparable numbers. The
investment loans can be found in the portfolio: Mezzanine Equity Partners.
Tables 55-2 and 55-3 display a breakdown of the Corporate Loan portfolio among regions and
portfolio, at year-end 2019 and 2018. The Corporate Loan portfolio decreased by EUR 156 million
in 2019 to EUR 9,496 million mainly due to exposure decreases in the portfolios: Shipping, Financial
Sponsors and Leveraged Finance and Energy. The decreases in the geographic region were mainly in
Germany and United Kingdom. The relative weight of NIBC’s core growth market the Netherlands
increased, as well as the share of 'The rest of Europe'. The corporate loan portfolio in the
Netherlands increased to 49% of the total exposure at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018:
46%).

CRR/CRD IV and credit approval process
NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under AIRB approach for quantifying the credit
quality of its Corporate Loan portfolio. In line with CRR/CRD IV regulations, the methodology
consists of three elements:
■ CCR, reflecting the through-the-cycly PD of the borrower. The default definition is in line with the
CRR/CRD IV definition2
■ LGD, defined as an anticipated loss in the event of default and under an economic downturn
assumption, which takes into account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ EAD, which is the amount that is expected to be outstanding at the moment a counterparty
defaults.
The CRR/CRD IV PDs, LGDs and EADs that are calculated through NIBC's internal models are used
for the calculation of expected loss (EL) and regulatory capital (RC). Economic capital (EC), risk-
adjusted return on capital (RAROC), limit setting and stress testing are additional areas which make
use of these parameters, although the values and methodologies for both EC and stress testing differ
from those employed in Pillar 1. PDs, LGDs and EADs are also used in the CRR/CRD IV solvency
report to the regulator.
Annual backtests of the internal rating framework are carried out to assess the quality and the
performance of the models. The internal CCRs and LGDs are also benchmarked periodically with the
scales of external rating agencies.
NIBC enforces strict separation of responsibilities with respect to its internal rating methodologies
and rating process, model development, model validation and internal audit. The roles and
responsibilities of each department involved are explicitly set out in internal policies and manuals, also
in conformity with the stipulations of CRR/CRD IV on model governance. 
2 According to the CRR/CRD IV definition, a default is determined at the borrower level. A default is indicated by using a 9 or 10 rating in NIBC’s
internal rating scale. A default is considered to have occurred with respect to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events
have taken place: i) the bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the
bank to actions such as realising security (if held); ii) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 289
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IFRS9 for expected credit loss determination
In order to calculate the Expected Credit Losses (ECL), NIBC has transformed the CRDIV/CRR
PD/LGD/EAD to unbiased and point-in-time best-estimates by applying probability-weighted
forward-looking scenarios for relevant macroeconomic factors. The ECL consists of three elements:
■ Point-in-time PD of the borrower, which is an estimate of the default rate over any specified
horizon based on the current state of the credit cycle and the anticipated macroeconomic
scenarios. 
■ Point-in-time LGD, defined as the unbiased loss estimate at a future default date, which takes into
account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ Point-in-Time EAD, which is the estimation of the exposure at a future default date, taking into
account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments and
prepayments of principal and interest, and expected drawdowns on undrawn committed facilities.
Credit approval process
All approvals of individual credit proposals are granted after risk management has made a credit risk
assessment and has analysed proposals by taking into consideration, among others, aggregate limits
set per country, per industry segment, and per individual counterparty. The total one obligor
exposure and related exposure are also taken into account. Individual credit and transaction
proposals are then approved in the Transaction Committee (TC). Proposals, credit reviews and
amendments of smaller scale can be approved outside the TC by risk management. All
counterparties and, subsequently, all facilities, are reviewed at least once a year.
Credit ratings
NIBC uses an internal through-the-cycle CCR rating scale which consists of 10 grades (1-10) and a
total of 22 notches. This internal rating table relates to the tables in note 21 and note 23 showing the
credit quality and the maximum exposure to credit risk. The CCRs 9 and 10 are assigned to
counterparties that have already defaulted and therefore carry a PD of 100%.
Internal rating grade Equivalent rating scale of Standard & Poor's
Internal rating description from to Low PD% High PD% from to
Investment grade 1 4- 0.00% 0.425%
Sub-investment grade 5+ 8- 0.425% 100%
Default grade 9 9
Default grade (bankruptcy filing) 10 10
The weighted average CCR of the non-defaulted clients remained stable during 2019 to 6+ with an
average PD of 2.1% at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: 1.8%). The credit quality in terms of
CCRs remained concentrated in the sub-investment grade categories 5 and 6 (BB and B categories in
external rating agencies’ scales).
Graph 55-4 shows the distribution of the drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR.
The numbers on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s internal rating scale, whereas the letters in
parentheses refer to the equivalent rating scale of Standard & Poor’s. NR stands for not ratable, which
was a negligible portion of the corporate loans (0.6% at 31 December 2019; 0.1% at 31 December
2018). NR is assigned to entities for which NIBC’s corporate rating tools were not suitable at the
time of rating.

NIBC's internal LGD scale consists of 7 grades (A-F) and 10 notches, each of which represents a
different degree of recovery prospects and loss expectations. LGD ratings are facility-specific. The
weighted average LGD remained stable at B-1 grade with improved average LGD of 13.8% at
31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: 14.4%). The weighted average LGD is calculated for non-
defaulted loans and is weighted by exposure. Nearly all facilities within NIBC have some form of
collateralisation, resulting in LGDs concentrated (at inception) in those LGD categories which
correspond to high recoveries in the range of 80% and 90%.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note that the corporate loan exposure of graph 55-5 refers to non-defaulted exposure as the LGD
is a measure of anticipated loss for facilities of a non-defaulted counterparty.
The most significant types of collateral securing the loan and derivative portfolios are tangible assets,
such as real estate, vessels, rigs and equipment. Exposures in the shipping and offshore energy sectors
are primarily secured by moveable assets such as vessels and drilling vessels. The commercial real
estate portfolio is primarily collateralised by mortgages on financed properties. The fair value of
collateral affects the LGD and therefore indirectly affects the calculation of the ECL and is generally
assessed at inception and periodically re-assessed thereafter. Collateral value on a going concern basis
is estimated using third-party appraisers, whenever possible, or valuation techniques based on
common market practice. Realisable collateral value is determined as collateral value after haircuts for
factors such as business cycle, location, asset construction status or guarantor counterparty rating. For
example, loan-to-value ratios are regularly tested and vessels are appraised semi-annually by external
parties. Other commercial exposures are, to a large extent, collateralised by assets such as inventory,
debtors, lease and other receivables and third-party credit protection (e.g. guarantees).
Arrears
The total arrears in the Corporate Loan portfolio to the total outstanding increased to 0.7% at
31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: 0.9%). An overview of the amounts in arrear per arrear
bucket is provided in tables 55-6 and 55-7. The exposure amounts refer to drawn and undrawn
amounts of those facilities with an arrear. The "% of On-balance" in the table 55-6 and 55-7 refers to
drawn amounts only. The amounts in arrear are the actual amounts overdue at 31 December 2019
and 31 December 2018. The column labelled ‘Impairment Amount’ includes stage 3 assets as well as
Purchased Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) assets currently in stage 3 (31 December 2019:

NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a loan carries a non-material arrear. If the total of
the sum of all individual arrears on facility level is lower than 1% of the loan amount outstanding and
EUR 500, and the oldest due date of individual counterparty is less than 90 days, then the arrear is
considered insignificant. If arrears fall within the threshold, the exposure is placed on the ‘no payment
in arrear’ line on tables 55-6 and 55-7. The application of this threshold does not influence the total
arrears, which amounted to EUR 57 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018:
EUR 72 million).
Graph 55-8 displays the rating distribution of the exposure amounts (expressed as the sum of drawn
and undrawn amounts) of all loans with an amount in arrears. The total exposure amount at
31 December 2019 was EUR 182 million (31 December 2018: EUR 387 million) and the total drawn
amount at 31 December 2019 was EUR 158 million (31 December 2018: EUR 196 million).

Forbearance and non-performing Corporate Loans
NIBC considers a client to be forborne if:
1. NIBC considers the obligor to be in financial difficulties, and
2. NIBC grants a concession to the obligor
Financial difficulties are defined as a debtor facing or about to face difficulties meeting financial
obligations. Concession refers to one of the following (per facility):
■ Modification of terms or conditions of a troubled facility to allow sufficient debt service capacity
(that would not be granted if the obligor were not in financial difficulties);
■ (partial) Refinancing of a troubled facility (that would not be granted without financial difficulties).
An obligor is considered non-performing if one or more of the following criteria are applicable:
■ Material exposures are more than 90 days past due;
■ The obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without realisation of collateral;
■ A performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional forbearance measures or
becomes more than 30 days past due.
The first two criteria are the same as the default criteria and therefore a defaulted obligor is always
non-performing as well.
Tables 55-9 and 55-10 provide the total forborne outstanding in the corporate and investment loan
portfolio per portfolio and per region as at 31 December 2019. The forborne outstanding is divided
in performing and non-performing outstanding. NIBC considers a client non-performing if that client
is in default, or if a performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional forbearance
measures, or becomes more than 30 days past due. At the end of December 2019, EUR 65 million
non-performing outstanding was not forborne. Comparable figures for 2018 can be seen in tables
55-11 and 55-12.

Expected credit losses amounts
With the exception of purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, ECL is determined
under the following three stages:
■ Stage 1 – For newly originated loans and loans with no significant increase in their credit risk, the
ECL is determined on a 12-month horizon;
■ Stage 2 – For loans with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), ECL is determined on a
(remaining) lifetime basis. The assessment of SICR incorporates forward-looking information and is
performed on a regular basis at an obligor level.
■ Stage 3 - For defaulted and credit-impaired loans, the ECL is determined on a (remaining) lifetime
basis and based on facility-specific cash flow scenarios. The loss amount is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows. If collateral is present, then the present value of the future cash flows reflects the
foreclosure of collateral. More information on the method impairments are calculated is included
in the Accounting Policies section.
NIBC determines a default on a borrower level, whereas the credit-impaired definition is applied at
facility level. When a default occurs, the entire exposure and outstanding amount of the borrower
are classified as defaulted. If, however, stage 3 expected credit loss amount is taken on a facility, only
the exposure amount of that particular facility is classified as credit-impaired.
In 2019, the total write-offs (EUR 57 million) increased compared to 2018 (EUR 48 million), mainly in
Financial Sponsors and Leveraged Finance and Energytors. The stock of impairments (related to stage
3 assets including stage 3 assets classified as POCI) decreased and amounted to EUR 128 million at
year-end 2019 (year-end 2018: EUR 138 million).
Tables 55-14 and 55-15 display an overview of IFRS 9 stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 ECL amounts at
31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, subdivided in portfolios and regions, respectively. The

Country risk
Country risk is the risk that an entity defaults due to political, social, economical or financial turmoil in
its applicable jurisdiction(s). Country risk can potentially be an important cause of increased
counterparty default risk since a large number of individual debtors could default at the same time.
NIBC did not experience any counterparty defaults from this risk in 2019.
Lease receivables
The main part of the lease receivable exposure is related one single counterparty with an exposure
of EUR 30 million (2018: EUR 32 million). This exposure is 100% defaulted, non-performing and
impaired. The remainder of EUR 4 million relates to a obtained leasing portfolio as a result of the
acquisition of Gallinat-Bank AG in Germany (2018: EUR 21 million).
Mortgage loans
The composition of the Mortgage loan portfolio at year-end 2019 and at year-end 2018 is displayed

Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio
The Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of owner occupied mortgages. These contain
NIBC Direct loans originated by business partners since 2013, as well as white label mortgage loans
that were also originated by business partners till 2009 or acquired through third parties. Buy-to-Let
(NIBC Vastgoed Hypotheek) mortgages for investors were started in January 2015. This niche
currently comprises approximately 7% of the total mortgage portfolio. Servicing and administration of
the mortgage portfolio is outsourced to third-party servicers. Acceptance and special servicing is
performed in-house.
At 31 December 2019, 21% of the Mortgage loan portfolio (31 December 2018: 24%) had a Dutch
government guarantee (NHG guarantee) in accordance with the general terms and conditions set by
the Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woningen (WEW , Social Housing Guarantee Fund).
A part of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio has been securitised to obtain external funding. NIBC
generally retains the junior notes As a result the securitisation programmes are consolidated on
NIBC’s balance sheet. The total amount of the retained positions at 31 December 2019 was
EUR 31.4 million (31 December 2018: EUR 33.6 million).
Risk governance Dutch mortgage loans
In order to control the credit risk in the origination of residential mortgage loans, an acceptance
policy framework was formulated to screen residential mortgage applications. Acceptance depends
on the following underwriting criteria:
■ Conformity with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Credits of the Dutch Bankers Association
where applicable;
■ A check of an applicant’s credit history with the Dutch National Credit Register (Bureau Krediet
Registratie or BKR), a central credit agency used by financial institutions in the Netherlands, which
records five years of financial commitments and negative credit events;
■ Mortgage loans are secured by first-ranking mortgage rights;
■ Other criteria, such as type of property, maximum Loan-To-Market Value (LTMV), maximum Loan-
to-Income (LTI) and minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR);
■ Underwriting criteria for mortgages with an NHG guarantee are set in accordance with the
general terms and conditions set by the WEW. The WEW finances itself by a one-off up-front
charge to the borrower as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan. The NHG
guarantee covers losses on the outstanding principal, accrued unpaid interest, and disposal costs,
caused by foreclosure.
In 2019, the following amendments were implemented:
■ The maximum NHG guaranteed loan amount increased to EUR 290 thousand.
■ Maximum Loan-to-Value decreased to 100% in 2018 for owner occupied mortgages. For Buy-to-
Let mortgages, maximum LTMV in rented state is currently 75% (in 2018 at 70%) (not regulated
by law).
Management of loans in arrears Dutch mortgage loans
In order to control the credit risk in the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio, NIBC has established
procedures to manage all loan amounts in arrears. All amounts in arrears are managed in-house. This
ensures a dedicated team focused on preventing and minimising credit losses. The Special Servicing
Mortgages team is responsible for arrears, client retention, foreclosures, collecting remaining debts
and visiting clients and properties that serve as collateral.
302 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The special servicing at NIBC is focused on intensive contact with its mortgage clients and tailor-
made solutions. When amounts in arrears occur, the borrower receives a letter after the first day of
arrears. Within one week, the client is contacted by phone. Depending on the outcome of these
contacts, a customer-specific approach is formulated on a case-by-case basis. Customer visits are
made if arrears reach two months. In case of defaults, the Special Servicing team has to submit the
file to the Arrears Management Committee for approval of the strategy to be followed. The Arrears
Management Committee includes members from Risk Management, Operations, Portfolio
Management and the Special Servicing team. NIBC bids for own foreclosed properties at auctions to
ensure the proceeds are at arm’s length. If needed, NIBC acquires these properties.
NIBC has introduced a programme where vulnerable customers that may face potential future
financial difficulties are approached pro-actively with the intention of identifying and resolving
difficulties before actual arrears arise.
Table 55-23 shows the arrears overview of the total Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December
2019 and 31 December 2018. Overall, the notional amount in arrears decreased compared to year
end 2018 while the portfolio volume has grown with 7%.

Forbearance Dutch mortgage loans
NIBC has developed a forbearance policy for mortgage clients experiencing financial difficulties and
who consequently are unable to meet the original terms and conditions of the contract. The
forbearance policy is defined, formalised and implemented in the standard working routines and
processes and is similar to the policy applied for the corporate loan portfolio.
NIBC has been providing a forbearance program to its mortgagers who are experiencing financial
difficulties since May 2013. The Client Retention team of the Special Servicing department has the
responsibility of assessing the nature and the expected duration of a client’s financial distress, and will
determine necessity of providing forbearance measures to that client and the conditions that should
apply. The team considers forbearance solutions for clients who do not fully meet their financial
obligations to NIBC. Forbearance solutions are also submitted to the Arrears Management
Committee for further approval. At 31 December 2018, EUR 50 million was forborne of which
EUR 35 million was performing and EUR 16 million non-performing. At 31 December 2019,
EUR 29 million was reported as forborne of which EUR 22 million was performing and EUR 7 million
non-performing.
Risk measurement Dutch mortgage loans
NIBC’s rating methodology for residential mortgage loans has been used for determining regulatory
capital requirements since 2008. The calculation of PD, LGD and EAD for owner- occupied
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 303
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
mortgages is performed by an internally-developed CRR/CRD IV AIRB model (for Buy-to-Let
mortgages, Basel standardised approach for credit risk is used).
The PD estimates are dependent on a variety of factors, of which the key factors are debt- to-
income and loan-to-value ratios. Minor factors that play a role in the PD estimates are several other
mortgage loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and payment performance information. The
PD scale is based on a continuous scale ranging from 0-100%.
The validation of these estimates is performed on historical data and is carried out annually. For the
PD, the estimates are back tested against realised defaults and realised losses. In this way, it is ensured
that the model functions correctly in a changing economic environment. Moreover, NIBC is closely
following recent regulatory proposals regarding the adjusted capital requirements under standardised
approach and introducing of capital floors also known as Basel IV.
Table 55-24 shows the PD distribution of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2019
and 31 December 2018. A PD of 100% means that a borrower is close to or more than 90 days in
arrears.

Impairment amounts or Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are calculated on individual residential
mortgage loans.
For ECL for mortgages the staging can be summarised as follows:
■ Stage 1 – For newly originated loans and loans with no significant increase in their credit risk, the
ECL is determined on a 12-month horizon;
■ Stage 2 – For loans with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), ECL is determined on a lifetime
basis.
■ Stage 3 - For defaulted loans the ECL is determined on a lifetime basis and based on facility-
specific cash flow scenarios. The expected loss is measured as the difference between the
exposure at default and the sale proceeds of the collateral through private sale or auction.
Taking into account probability weighted scenarios for the forward looking macro economy, the ECL
per individual mortgage loan consists of three risk parameters:
■ Point-in-time PD of the borrower, which is an estimate of the default rate over any specified
horizon based on the current state of the credit cycle and the anticipated macroeconomic
scenarios. 
■ Point-in-time LGD, defined as the unbiased loss estimate at a future default date, which takes into
account the presence and the value of collateral;
304 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Point-in-Time EAD, which is the estimation of the exposure at a future default date, taking into
account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments and
prepayments of principal and interest and arrears
Risk mitigation and collateral management Dutch mortgage loans
Credit losses are mitigated in a number of ways:
■ The underlying property is pledged as collateral;
■ 20% of the Dutch own book portfolio and 31% of the securitised portfolio are covered by the
NHG programme; 
■ For the part of the Dutch portfolio that has been securitised, credit losses higher than the retained
positions, excess spread and reserve accounts are attributable to investors in the securitisation
programmes.
For the portfolio not covered by the NHG programme, the underlying property is the primary
collateral for any mortgage loan granted, though savings, life insurance and investment deposits may
also serve as additional collateral.
An indicator for potential losses, taking into account indexation of house prices and seasoning, is the
Loan-to-Indexed-Market-Value ( LTIMV ). The indexation is made by using the CBS/Kadaster index,
which is based on market observables. The Kadaster (national property register) is a public
government register of real estate and their vested rights (e.g. ownership and mortgages). This
register contains transaction data as well as CBS (Statistics Netherlands) data, which are used to
construct a pricing index. Graphs 55-25 and 55-26 show a breakdown of the LTIMV for the total
Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018. The average
seasoning of the total portfolio is approximately 7 years, 1% of the total portfolio has an LTIMV
above 100%. For the remainder of the portfolio, the indexed collateral value is less than or equal to
the nominal loan balance outstanding or is a NHG guaranteed mortgage.

German Mortgage loan portfolio
The German Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to EUR 19 million at 31 December 2019
(31 December 2018: EUR 29 million). The collateral value of this portfolio amounted to
EUR 42 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 57 million). The majority of this
portfolio was acquired from third parties via two portfolio purchases. The purchased portfolios
contain highly seasoned loans with low LTMV.
As is the case in the Netherlands, the underlying property is the primary collateral for the granted
mortgage loan. The majority of mortgage loans in Germany contain an annuity debt profile, leading
to a lower outstanding balance during the lifetime of the loan.
Debt investments
NIBC defines credit risk in debt investments as issuer risk, which is the credit risk of losing the
principal amount on products such as bonds. Issuer risk is calculated based on the book value.
Risk monitoring and measurement
Risk is controlled by setting single issuer limits and, in some cases, programme limits. All single issuer
limits are approved by the TC or by delegated authority to the Financial Markets Credit Risk
(FMCR) department. Apart from single issuer limits, risk is also monitored by assessing credit spread
risk. Both sensitivity analysis (basis point values, BPVs) and Value at Risk (VaR) numbers are used3.
Note 57 on Market Risk contains more information on these variables.
In the remainder of this section, the exposure has been divided into the following two sub-portfolios:
■ Debt from financial institutions, corporate entities and sovereigns;
■ Securitisations.
Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities
NIBC invests in debt (bonds) issued by financial institutions and corporate entities. The size of this
sub-portfolio increased in the course of 2019 to EUR 334 million at 31 December 2019
(31 December 2018: EUR 248 million). Of the total exposure, 40% (31 December 2018: 39%) were
covered bonds. The remaining 60% (31 December 2018: 61%) was senior unsecured debt.
In 2014, NIBC began to use internal ratings to assess the creditworthiness of a financial institution. In
general debt investments are rated more conservative by NIBC than by the external rating agencies.

306 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of 31 December 2019 NIBC has reverted back to the Standardised Approach for these
counterparties.
The amount of EUR 334 million at 31 December 2019 represents the maximum credit risk exposure,
without taking into account the presence of any collateral that could be repossessed in case of
default. The portfolio did not contain any credit default swap exposures.

and corporate entities had no credit losses and contained no arrears.
Securitisations
NIBC has been an active participant on the securitisation market in the past decade, both as an
originator and investor in securitisations.
Tables 55-29 and 55-30 present an overview of NIBC’s total securitisation exposure resulting from its
activities as investor in securitisations. The exposure relating to NIBC’s activities as an originator can
be split into exposures related to consolidated and non-consolidated securitisations. If a securitisation
programme is consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet, the exposure to the underlying collateral is
excluded from the securitisation exposure and included in the total exposures presented in note 55
on credit risk in the corporate loans or mortgage loans sections. NIBC’s total exposure as an
originator to consolidated securitisations was EUR 199 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December
2018: EUR 215 million).
NIBC distinguishes two Securitisation sub-portfolios: the portfolio of Western European
Securitisations and the Liquidity Investments portfolio.
NIBC’s total securitisation exposure (investor and non-consolidated originator) decreased to
EUR 514 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 577 million), mainly due to an
decrease of the Liquidity portfolio.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 307
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The portfolio of investments in Western European securitisations contains NIBC’s investor
securitisations in Western Europe as well as all investments in NIBC’s own non-consolidated
securitisations. All investments in NIBC’s own securitisations are subject to approval from both Risk
Management and Finance. The total amount of the portfolio of investments in Western Europe
decreased to EUR 59 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 65 million). The
Liquidity Investments portfolio was set up to invest part of NIBC’s excess liquidity in the securitisation
market. Investments are in majority AAA rated RMBS transactions backed by Dutch collateral or
European ABS and are eligible to be pledged as collateral with the European Central Bank (ECB).
Apart from the strict mandate, each investment is pre-approved by FMCR. Exposure in this portfolio
decreased to EUR 451 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 512 million). The
underlying assets in the collateral pools of NIBC’s securitisation investments comprise Dutch
residential mortgage loans (NL-RMBS AAA Liquidity Portfolio) and French and German car loans and
credit card receivables (EU-ABS AAA Liquidity Portfolio).

Geographic distribution of securitisations
Graph 55-31 presents the distribution of the Securitisations portfolio by geographic region at
31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018. NIBC allocates exposure to a region based on the
geographic location in which the cash flows are generated. The geographic distribution illustrates that
the majority of these assets are located in Western Europe, mainly in the Netherlands (74%),
Germany (10%) and the United Kingdom (5%). NIBC’s exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal is
limited and had decreased to EUR4 million at 31 December 2019 (31 December 2018:
EUR 5 million). Approximately 94% of this exposure is investment grade exposure. NIBC had no
exposure in Greece at 31 December 2019 or 2018.

Expected credit losses on securitisations
The majority of the Securitisations portfolio is reported at amortised cost or fair value for accounting
purposes and the respective assets are subject to a quarterly credit-impaired analysis. Expected credit
losses related to stage 3 are taken when the expected future cashflows are insufficient to meet the
payment obligatons. The stock of stage 3 credit losses decreased to below EUR 0.1 million at
31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 0.5 million).

Cash management
NIBC is exposed to credit risk as a result of cash management activities. In 2019, NIBC’s risk
management framework for cash management continued its conservative approach, taking into
account the vulnerable financial markets.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 309
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk monitoring and measurement
NIBC places its excess cash with the DNB/Dutch State Treasury Agency and with a selected number
of investment-grade financial institutions. A monitoring process is in place within the FMCR
department for the approved financial institutions. Cash management exposures can be collateralised
through reverse repo transactions or unsecured through interbank deposits and current accounts.
Correspondent banking and third-party account providers
Apart from the exposure in cash management, NIBC holds foreign currency accounts at
correspondent banks and also utilises third-party account providers for internal securitisations.
Exposures
At 31 December 2019, NIBC’s total cash amounted EUR 2,485 million (31 December 2018:
EUR 2,601 million). EUR1,945 million of the cash was held at DNB, Deutsche Bundesbank, and the
central bank in Belgium, EUR 506 million at financial institutions and EUR 14 million at corporate
entities (securitisation-related liquidity facilities).

At year-end 2019, EUR 191 million cash collateral has been excluded from the cash management
exposure (year-end 2018: EUR 155 million) as this amount is restricted cash that relates to
derivatives with a negative fair value. At both 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, this
portfolio carried no impairments and no arrears.
Credit risk in derivatives
Credit risk in derivatives is the risk of having to replace the counterparty in derivative contracts.
NIBC’s credit risk in derivatives can be split into exposures to financial institutions and corporate
entities. NIBC’s policy is to minimise this risk. NIBC only enters into OTC contracts with central
clearing counterparties and financial institutions that are investment grade or with corporate entities
where the exposure is secured by some form of collateral.
310 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk monitoring and measurement
Credit risk in derivatives is based on the marked-to-market value and Potential Future Exposure (PFE)
of the derivative. The PFE reflects a potential future change in marked-to- market value during the
remaining lifetime of the derivative contract. For financial institutions, separate limits for credit risk are
in place, based on the external rating. For corporate clients, NIBC enters into a derivative transaction
as part of its overall relationship with the client. The credit approval process for these derivatives is
closely linked with the credit approval process of the loan. Limit-setting proposals for both financial
institutions and corporate counterparties are reviewed in the TC. For financial institutions, collateral
postings under a CSA are taken into account. In 2019 NIBC offsetted assets and liabilities with central
clearing members. Derivatives with the same characteristics, being counterparty, maturity bucket and
currency are netted. In 2019, EUR 2 million of NIBC’s derivative portfolio including netting, but
excluding collateral and PFE has been centrally cleared. For corporate counterparties, both the loan
and derivative are treated as a single package whereby the derivative often benefits from the security/
collateral supporting the loan exposure.
Exposures
Tables 55-36 and 55-37 display NIBC exposures from credit risk in derivatives allocated across the
rating class of the underlying counterparty. Exposure is the sum of the positive marked-to-market
value of derivative contracts, excluding the effect of netting and collateral exchange. The total
derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral decreased in 2019 to EUR 483 million at
31 December 2019 (31 December 2018: EUR 578 million).

Collateral
To the extent possible, NIBC attempts to limit credit risk arising from derivatives. NIBC enters into
bilateral collateral agreements with financial institutions to mitigate credit risk in OTC derivatives by
means of CSAs. Positive marked-to-market values can be netted with negative marked-to-market
values and the remaining exposure is mitigated through bilateral collateral settlements (as in tables
55-38 and 55-39). Accepted collateral is mainly cash collateral, which is usually exchanged on a daily
basis. The primary counterparties in these CSAs are large international banks with ratings of A or
higher. NIBC generally carries out daily cash collateral exchanges to account for changes in the
market value of the contracts included in the CSA.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 311
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Terms and conditions of these CSAs are in line with general International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) credit support documents. Collateral from CSAs significantly decreases the credit
exposure on derivatives, as presented in table 59-38 at 31 December 2019 and in table 55-39 at
December 2018.

Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit and debt value adjustments)
CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of the
counterparty as well as the own default risk of NIBC. The adjustments are applied to all OTC
derivative contracts, except for those that benefit from a solid collateral agreement where cash
collateral is regularly exchanged, mitigating the credit risk. In practice, this means that CVA and DVA
are only applied to OTC derivative contracts that generate credit risk on corporate (i.e. non-financial)
counterparties.
Arrears
NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a derivative carries a non-material arrear. The
criteria for this threshold are the same as for the portfolio of corporate loans. If amounts in arrear fall
below the threshold (EUR 100,000), they are considered insignificant and are therefore excluded.
The application of the threshold does not influence the total arrears for 2019 and 2018.
Table 55-40 displays an overview of the arrears for corporate derivatives at 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018 as well as the exposures (marked-to-market values) these arrears refer to. There
were no amounts in arrear for derivatives with financial institutions. As shown in Table 55-40, at
31 December 2019, no marked-to-market exposure in arrear (31 December 2018: no marked-to-
market exposure in arrear).

56 Interest rate risk in the Banking book
NIBC defines interest rate risk in the Banking book (IRRBB) as the risk of losses from interest rate
sensitive positions in non-trading activities due to movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is
measured both from an economic value perspective and an earnings perspective. The first
perspective considers the impact on the market value, while the latter considers the impact on the
net interest income.
NIBC’s banking book consists of:
■ Corporate treasury
■ Commercial Treasury
■ Corporate banking
■ Retail banking
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for IRRBB from an economic value perspective is measured by the modified
duration of equity and equal to 5 (with a tolerance of 7.5), while the risk appetite from an earnings
perspective is measured by the impact on 1Y earnings and equal to EUR 18 million (assuming a shift
in interest rates of 100 bps).
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest BPV and interest VaR measures are calculated on a daily basis and
reviewed by the Market Risk department:
■ Interest BPV measures the sensitivity of the market value to an instantaneous change of one basis
point in each time bucket of the interest rate curve. The BPV as displayed in the tables represents
the sensitivity of the market value to a one-basis-point, parallel upward shift of the underlying
curve;
■ The interest VaR measures the threshold value, which daily marked-to-market losses with a
confidence level of 99% will not exceed, based on four years of historical data for daily changes in
interest rates. These daily changes are superimposed on the current market rates. The VaR is
calculated by means of full valuation to take non-linearity into account.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 313
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In measuring BPV and VaR for the Banking book the (credit) spreads have been excluded from
cashflows and discounting, in line with EBA guidelines. This change in calculation was gradually
implemented during 2019.
From the earnings perspective changes in interest rates occur both instantaneously and gradually over
time. The combination of static and dynamic (changes to the current portfolio composition) analyses
are used. The dynamic analysis allows the integration of the business strategy in the earnings, by
aligning the development of the balance sheet with the business plan, taking into account both
refinancing and reinvestments. Earnings at risk (EaR) is calculated by means of the following measure:
■ 12 months earnings impact due to a 200 bps gradual upwards or downwards interest rate shock
per currency
EaR as displayed in the tables represents the 200 bps gradual upwards measure.
The interest rate risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as
stress testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future
events.
Limits are set on the above measures, both those from the economic value perspective and from an
earnings perspective. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once every month. Any
major breach of IRRBB limits is reported to the CRO immediately.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk in the Banking book
Interest rate risk in the Banking book from an economic value perspective is mainly present in the
Mismatch book.
NIBC accepts a certain economic value risk exposure in the Mismatch book. We call this our
strategic mismatch exposure.
The Mismatch book exclusively contains swaps in EUR and GBP as these are, next to USD, the major
currencies in which also lending activities take place.The Mismatch book contained no USD position
in 2019. At year-end of 2019 the total notional position is EUR 463 million, with 70% of the mismatch
position held in EUR and 30% in GBP. Duration based the relative positions would be 78% in
EUR and 22% in GBP.
The Mortgage loan book consists of:
■ The White Label portfolio which has a size of 3.7 billion EUR at year-end 2019 with
EUR 20 million in Germany.
■ The NIBC Direct portfolio, which has a size of EUR 6.2 billion .
The mortgage loan portfolios are accounted on amortised cost and notional hedging is applied to
hedge the interest rate risk.
The Corporate Treasury book contains mainly the funding activities of NIBC and the corporate loan
books. The Liquidity portfolio, Collateral portfolio and Debt Investments portfolio are part of the
Banking Book and consist mainly of investments in financial institutions and securitisations.
Tables 56-1 and 56-2 illustrate in EUR the interest rate sensitivity (BPV) for EUR, USD and GBP in the

■ the risk of losses in the Banking Book from NIBC’s credit spread risk position;
■ the risk of losses in both the banking and trading book from adverse movements in currencies
with respect to the Euro.
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC Holding are interest rate risk and credit spread risk .
In Money Markets & Trading, NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and USD yield
curves. This book also contains interest rate risk related to derivative transactions of NIBC’s clients.
All positions within NIBC Markets are part of the Trading book. The Trading book of NIBC Markets
contains bonds and a relatively small equity portfolio in those equities, for which NIBC markets is
liquidity provider.
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for market risk is moderate. For all market risk types limits are set and monitored
on a daily basis.
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest and credit spread BPV and interest and credit spread and equity VaR
measures are calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the Market Risk department. VaR is
calculated using 4 years of historical data and a confidence level of 99%.
The market risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as stress
testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future events.
Limits are set on the above measures. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once
every month. Any major breach of market risk limits is reported to the CRO immediately.
Interest rate risk, credit spread risk and equity risk
Money Markets & Trading contains plain vanilla interest rate derivatives only. Figures per year-end
2019 versus 2018 are displayed below.

Currency risk
NIBC manages its overall currency position based on the currency positions in the monthly balance
sheets. The main exposures in foreign currencies for NIBC are USD, GBP and JPY. NIBC uses
matched funding and other measures to apply its policy of not taking any currency positions. Any
currency position which does show at month end is caused by movements in the fair value of assets
or liabilities or interest income in foreign currencies and is hedged by entering into FX spot
transactions. The total open foreign currency position, by nominal amount, was EUR 23.6 million at
year-end 2019. This currency position is the position prior to hedging, which is always done shortly
after month-end. Regulatory capital for currency risk is equal to1.9 million EUR per end of 2019.

Furthermore, the impact of a reasonably possible yearly change (in absolute terms) of EUR against
other currencies was calculated. Per end of 2019 the impact of these reasonably possible changes is
as follows for NIBC Holding (only currencies with the larger exposures are displayed).

58 Liquidity risk
NIBC defines liquidity risk as the inability of NIBC to fund its assets and meet its obligations as they
become due, at acceptable cost.
Maintaining a sound liquidity and funding profile is one of NIBC’s most important risk management
objectives. NIBC analyses its funding profile by mapping all assets and liabilities into time buckets that
correspond to their maturities. Based on projections prepared by the business units and reviewed by
Risk Management, and the current asset and liability maturity profiles, several liquidity stress tests are
prepared and presented once every two weeks to the ALCO, in order to create continuous
monitoring of the liquidity position.
Assumptions
One of the stress scenarios, the market-wide stress test, assumes a world-wide liquidity shortage in
which no new market funding can be attracted by NIBC. Furthermore, it is assumed that assets
cannot be sold, but that they can only be made liquid by making them eligible for collateralised and
ECB funding. In addition, the following assumptions are made:
■ In order to maintain NIBC’s business franchise, it is assumed that new corporate loan production
continues at a level where the current books are maintained constant;
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to for example collateral cash outflows (payments from
CSAs) and drawdowns of undrawn commitments are made; and
■ A one notch downgrade is assumed.
The projection of NIBC’s liquidity in this way is necessarily a subjective process and requires
management to make assumptions about, for example, the fair value of eligible collateral and
potential outflow of cash collateral placed by NIBC with derivative counterparties.
In light of these projections, NIBC is confident that sufficient liquidity is available to meet maturing
obligations over the next 12 months.
Maturity calendar consolidated balance sheet
The following tables present the cash flows payable by NIBC in respect of non-derivative financial
liabilities relevant for liquidity risk by the remaining contractual maturities at 31 December. The
318 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amounts disclosed in the tables for the non-derivative financial liabilities are contractual future
undiscounted cash flows. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are therefore restated
to future nominal amounts. The financial assets relevant for managing liquidity risk are based on the
fair value (discounted cash flows) for those assets which are classified at FVOCI.
The differences between the table and the stress scenario are caused mainly by the following items
that are included in the stress scenario analysis but not in the maturity calendar of the consolidated
balance sheet:
■ New asset production;
■ Collateralised funding capacity of internal securitisations and individual bonds; and
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to possible cash outflows (e.g. CSA collateral, callable
funding).

59 Capital management
Overview
It is NIBC’s policy to maintain a strong capital base, to meet regulatory capital requirements at all
times and to support the development of its business by allocating capital efficiently. Allocation of
capital to the business is based on an EC approach. EC is the amount of capital which NIBC allocates
as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based upon its assessment of risks. The EC
that NIBC allocates to each business is based on the assessment of risk of its activities. It differs from
the CRR/CRD IV capital requirements, i.e. regulatory capital, as in certain cases NIBC assesses the
322 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
specific risk characteristics of its business activities in a different way than the CRR/CRD IV method.
Total regulatory capital however, in combination with a minimum benchmark Tier 1 ratio, does form
a limit to the maximum amount of EC that can be allocated to the business.
Comparing the risk-based EC of each business to its profit delivers a RAROC for each business. EC
and RAROC are key tools in NIBC's capital allocation and usage process, assisting in allocating Own
Funds as efficiently as possible, based on expectations of both risks and return. Usage of EC is
assessed once every two weeks in the ALCO. The ALCO resets the maximum allocation level of EC
to and within each business, taking into account business expectations, NIBC's desired risk profile and
the regulatory requirements.
Methodology
NIBC uses the business model of each activity as the basis for determining the EC. If the business
model of an activity is trading, distribution or investing for a limited period, a market risk approach
based upon VaR and scaled to a one-year horizon is used to calculate the EC usage. A business
model based on 'buy-to-hold' or investing to maturity leads to a credit risk approach being applied,
based upon estimations of PD and LGD. Add-ons for operational risk and country risk are also
calculated. Furthermore, NIBC allocates EC for business risk, reputation risk and model risk on a
group-wide level.
The EC approach differs from the CRR/CRD IV approach in which only the trading books are
assigned a market risk approach. In the CRR/CRD IV framework, activities that are not trading but
have a business model based on distribution or investment for a limited period are often assigned a
credit risk approach, following CRR/CRD IV regulations or regulatory industry practice, whereas in
the EC framework NIBC applies a market risk approach similar to that of the trading activities. Risks
and EC are monitored accordingly.
The main differences between the EC capital and CRR/CRD IV framework come from the
Residential Mortgage portfolio, the Securitisations portfolio and NIBC’s interest rate mismatch
position. EC is determined by a market risk approach for these activities. The CRR/CRD IV approach
is either a credit risk approach (mortgage loans and securitisations) or is not part of the CRR/CRD IV
Pillar 1 at all (mismatch position).
Capital allocation
NIBC allocates EC to all its business activities in the form of limits set by the ALCO and calculates the
amount of EC usage of each business based on the risk of its activities:
■ For the Corporate Loan portfolio, NIBC calculates EC usage by means of a credit risk approach
largely based upon the CRR regulatory capital formula and an add-on for concentration risk;
■ For the Debt Investments and Trading portfolios, the Residential Mortgage portfolio and the
interest rate mismatch position, NIBC uses a market risk approach to determine EC usage. EC
usage for these portfolios is calculated using VaR, calculated with four years of historical data and
scaled to a one-year horizon;
■ For the Investment loans, NIBC calculates EC usage by applying a credit approach based upon the
CRR regulatory capital formula. NIBC uses fixed percentages for the equity investments.
CRR/CRD IV regulatory capital
The objective of CRR/CRD IV is to enhance the capital adequacy of the banking industry by making it
more responsive to risk. CRR/CRD IV is structured on three pillars:
■ Pillar 1 describes the capital adequacy requirements for three risk types; credit risk, market risk and
operational risk;
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 323
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Pillar 2 describes the additional supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), where regulators
analyse the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) of the individual banks. Since the
end of 2011, Dutch Central Bank also analyses the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process
(ILAAP);
■ In Pillar 3 the required risk reporting standards are displayed, supporting additional market
discipline in the international capital markets.
Under CRR/CRD IV and subject to approval from the regulator, banks have the option to choose
between various approaches, each with a different level of sophistication in risk management, ranging
from ‘standardised’ to ‘advanced’.
For credit risk, NIBC adopted the AIRB approach as further specified in CRR/CRD IV for its
corporate and retail mortgage exposure class. NIBC started using the AIRB approach at 1 January
2008. The residue of exposures is measured on the standardised approach.
For market risk, NIBC adopted an internal model VaR approach.
For measuring operational risk, NIBC adopted the standardised approach, which is based on
prescribed business-line activities.
The basis for Pillar 2 is NIBC’s ICAAP, which is NIBC’s self-assessment of risks sufficiently captured by
Pillar 1, i.e. the link between NIBC's risk profile, its risk management and risk mitigation, and NIBC's
capital planning.
Under Pillar 3, NIBC publishes its regulatory disclosures regarding its capital structure, capital
adequacy, liquidity risk, risk management objectives/policies and risk-weighted assets each year. The
Pillar 3 disclosures are published on the same date as the Annual Report on our website.
The following table displays the composition of regulatory capital as at 31 December 2019 and
31 December 2018. As from 2019, non-eligible profits attributable to the shareholders are no longer
added to regulatory capital. The regulatory capital is based on the CRR/CRD IV scope of
consolidation, calculated for NIBC consolidated on a fully loaded base including the eligible profit after
tax of the year. Only the profit after tax over the first half year of 2019 is eligible to be included in the
Common Equity Tier 1 after receiving permission of DNB. NIBC complies with the CRR/CRD IV
capital requirements as per 31 December 2019, which formally requires a minimum Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio (including capital buffer) of 10.5%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio (including capital buffer) of
12.0% and a minimum Total Capital ratio (including capital buffer) of 14.0%.

COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the company financial statements are
set out in the consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all
the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Where necessary, comparative figures have been
adjusted to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.
The company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements for
financial statements contained in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. NIBC applies the
provisions in Section 362, paragraph 8, Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code that make it
possible to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies
(including those for the presentation of financial instruments as equity or liability) used in its
consolidated financial statements.
The company financial statements are presented in euros rounded to the nearest million. The euro is
the functional and presentation currency of NIBC .
Summary of significant accounting policies
Except as set forth below, the accounting policies applied in the company financial statements are the
same as those for the consolidated financial statements.
Interests in group companies
Interests in group companies, as defined in the Subsidiaries section in the basis of consolidation in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements, are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is
determined by measuring the assets, provisions, liabilities and income based on the accounting
policies used in the consolidated financial statements. The company’s share of its group companies
profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. The bank applies paragraph 107a of the
Dutch Accounting Standard 100. Under this paragraph the bank eliminates the expected credit losses
on loans to subsidiaries in the same line item.
If losses of group companies that are attributable to the company exceed the carrying amount of the
interest in the group company (including separately presented goodwill, if any, and including other
unsecured receivables), further losses are not recognised unless the company has incurred obligations
or made payments on behalf of the group company to satisfy obligations of the group company. In
such a situation, NIBC recognises a provision up to the extent of its obligation.

category 'other' are classified as held for trading according to IAS 39.
Derivative financial assets used for hedge accouting are settled to market (STM). Derivative financial
assets other are Over The Counter (OTC).
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 343
COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The derivatives consist of:
■ Interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of the mortgage portfolio;
■ Interest rate swaps to transform fixed rate funding into floating rate funding;
■ FX and cross-currency swaps to fund the non-euro loans to customers or to transform non-euro
funding into euros;
■ Client-driven derivative transactions;
■ Limited money market trading.
Economically all these derivatives, with the exception of the limited proprietary trading .and client
driven transactions, are used to hedge interest rate or FX risk. The limited proprietary trading is
controlled by a small facilitating VaR limit of EUR 2.25 million. For further details see note 57 Market
risk of the consolidated financial statements.
Derivatives used for hedging are asigned in a hedge accounting relationship and can be ineffective.
Sources of ineffectiveness are the behaviour of the curve shift, the volatility of the basis spread over
the curve and the distribution of cash flows of assets and liabilities compared to the hedging
derivatives.

Fair value hedges of interest rate risk
The interest rate risk of financial assets with a fixed interest rate classified at available-for-sale or at
amortised costs are hedged with interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a fixed rate and
receives floating rates. Fair value hedge accounting is applied to these hedge relationships.
Interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate are used in fair
value hedges of fixed-interest rate liabilities (as far as not held for trading purposes or designated at
fair value through profit or loss).

Legal reserves
This concerns the reserve for unrealised fair value changes on certain non-listed trading assets,
derivatives related to these non-listed trading assets and on associates at fair value through profit or
loss .
The total legal reserves at 31 December 2019 amount to EUR 35 million, including a legal reserve
result participations of EUR 1 million (31 December 2018: EUR 30 million, including a legal reserve
result participations of EUR 1 million).
27 Capital securities
For a specification of the capital securities, see note 44 of the consolidated financial statements.
28 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-
interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.
The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table
by category. In the following table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced.
The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would
be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.

Undrawn facilities and capital commitments 1,519 1,537
Guarantees and letters of credit 102 84

These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC's policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 48 of the consolidated financial statements.

Independent auditor’s report 
To: the shareholders and Supervisory Board of NIBC Bank N.V. 
Report on the audit of the financial statements 2019

Basis for our opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements section of our report. 
 
We are independent of NIBC Bank N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements 
regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the “Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, 
Audit firms supervision act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij 
 
assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to 
 
 independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have 
 complied with the “Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 
     
364 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
 
OTHER INFORMATION
 
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.  
Our audit approach 
Our understanding of the business 
NIBC provides a broad range of financial services to retail and corporate clients. The group is structured 
in components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our 
audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of the group and our risk assessment. 
 
We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud, non-compliance with laws and regulations or error in 
order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks, and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
Materiality 
Materiality  €12 million (2018: €13 million) 
Benchmark applied  5% of profit before taxation (2018: 5%) 
Explanation  This benchmark is a generally accepted auditing practice and is widely 
used for listed entities. Based on our professional judgment regarding 
the common information needs of users of the financial statements, 
we believe that 5% of profit before taxation is an appropriate 
quantitative indicator of materiality. 
 
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are 
material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. 
 
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of € 0.6 million, which are identified 
during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be 
reported on qualitative grounds. 
Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations 
Our responsibility 
Although we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and cannot be expected to 
detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error.  
 
Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in fines, litigation or other consequences for the 
company that may have a material effect on the financial statements.

OTHER INFORMATION
 
Our audit response related to fraud risks 
In order to identify and assess the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to 
fraud, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity’s internal 
control relevant to the audit and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. As in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal control. 
We do not audit internal control per se for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the company’s internal control. 
 
We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors (including 
internal audit, legal and compliance) and the Supervisory Board. As part of our process of identifying 
fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud. 
 
We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the 
operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks. In addition, we performed 
procedures to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias in particular relating to important 
judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the “Summary of significant 
accounting policies”-section the financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and 
address high-risk journal entries. 
 
We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We considered the outcome of our other audit 
procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, we 
reevaluate our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on our audit procedures. 
 
Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations 
We assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could 
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry 
experience, through discussions with the Managing Board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit 
and compliance reports and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account 
balances or disclosures. 
 
We also inspected lawyers’ letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to 
any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written 
representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been 
disclosed to us.  
Going concern 
In order to identify and assess the risks of going concern and to conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, we consider based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial 
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.

OTHER INFORMATION
 
Scope of the group audit 
NIBC is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the 
consolidated financial statements of NIBC Bank N.V. NIBC is structured in operating segments: Corporate 
client offering, Retail client offering and Treasury and Group Functions. Corporate client offering is 
focused on mid-sized companies and entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, Germany and the United 
Kingdom. Retail client savings products are offered in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, and 
mortgage loans are offered in the Netherlands. 
 
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising 
and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit 
procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group 
entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be 
carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. 
 
We assigned a full scope to the banking activities in the Netherlands focusing of the four segments 
mentioned above which are managed centrally and audited by the group audit team. The component in 
Germany, focusing on the Corporate client offering, is audited by our German EY member firm. We have 
assigned a specific scope to the component. We sent detailed instruction to the component auditor, 
covering significant areas including the relevant risks of material misstatement and set out the 
information required to be reported to the group audit team. We have met the auditor and discussed the 
planning, risk assessment, procedures performed, findings and observations reported to us. 
 
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at 
group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s 
financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated financial statements.  
Teaming, use of specialists  
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills 
and competences which are needed for the audit of a listed client in the banking industry. We included 
specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury, tax, credit risk modelling and prudential reporting 
and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuations of financial instruments and private 
equity. 
General audit procedures 
Our audit further included among others: 
•  Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management 
•  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures 
•  Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation

Our key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. 
The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.  
 
The key audit matter IFRS 9 adoption which was included in our last year’s auditor’s report, is not 
considered a key audit matter for this year as it related to a one off event. 
 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
 
Estimation uncertainty with respect to impairment allowances for loans 
Risk  At 31 December 2019, NIBC reported Loans (amortized cost) of €7,164 million and a 
provision of €152 million for expected credit losses. The timing and measurement of 
expected credit losses requires estimates and judgment in setting assumptions in respect 
of: 
•  Allocation of corporate loans to stages 1, 2 and 3; 
•  Accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models to 
calculate the expected credit loss (ECL); 
•  Completeness and accuracy of data and inputs used to calculate the ECL; 
•  Inputs and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple macro-economic 
scenarios to calculate the ECL for stages 1 and 2; 
•  Measurement of individually assessed provisions, including the assessment of multiple 
recovery scenarios; 
•  Accuracy and adequacy of financial statement disclosures. 
 
Due to the significance of the corporate loan portfolio and the related estimation 
uncertainty of expected credit losses, we consider the measurement of the provision for 
expected credit losses as a key audit matter. Refer to the “Summary of significant 
accounting policies” section, the “Critical accounting estimates and judgments” section, 
note 24 “Loans (amortized cost)” and note 59 “Credit risk” to the financial statements. 
Our audit  We tested the design and where plausible the operating effectiveness of key controls 
approach  across the processes relevant to the ECL. This included the allocation of assets into 
stages, model governance, data accuracy and completeness, credit monitoring, multiple 
economic scenarios, individual provisions, journal entries and disclosures. 
 
We performed an overall assessment of the ECL provision levels by stage to determine if 
they are reasonable considering NIBC’s portfolio, risk profile, credit risk management 
practices and macroeconomic environment. We considered trends in the economy and 
industries to which NIBC is exposed. 
 
We challenged the criteria used to allocate corporate loans to stage 1, 2, or 3 in 
accordance with IFRS 9. We tested loans in stage 1,2 and 3 and verified whether they 
were allocated to the appropriate stage.

Estimation uncertainty with respect to impairment allowances for loans 
With the support of our modelling specialists, we tested assumptions, inputs and formulas 
used in a sample of ECL models.  
This included the appropriateness of model design and formulas used and recalculating 
the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default for a sample of 
models.  
Further, we assessed  the selected macro-economic scenarios used with the support of 
our economic specialists. 
We examined a selection of loan exposures to assess the expected credit loss provision 
for stage 3 loans. We applied professional judgment in selecting those exposures for our 
detailed inspection, placing an emphasis on portfolios that are potentially more sensitive 
to developing economic and political trends such as leveraged finance, offshore energy 
and shipping. For selected loan exposures we recalculated individually assessed 
provisions and  challenged the recovery scenarios and probability weights assigned.  
 
We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures for compliance with  
IFRS-EU. 
Key  We are satisfied that expected credit loss provisions are reasonable and in compliance 
observations   with IFRS 9. We concur with the related disclosures in the financial statements. 
Reliability and continuity of the information technology and systems 
Risk  NIBC is highly dependent on its IT systems and IT infrastructure for the continuity of the 
operations. NIBC continuously invests to further improve its IT environment and IT 
systems. In particular, significant  management attention was paid to outsourcing of 
various IT services to third parties. We therefore consider this as a key audit matter.  
Our audit  As part of our audit procedures we have assessed the changes in the IT systems and IT 
approach  infrastructure. We have tested the reliability and continuity of electronic data processing 
within the scope of the audit of the 2019 financial statements. For that purpose, we have 
included IT auditors in our team. Our procedures included testing of controls with regards 
to IT systems and processes relevant for financial reporting. 
 
A particular area of attention is related to logical access management, including access 
rights and segregation of duties. We evaluated the impact of changes during the year 
following the migration of applications to external service providers. We tested logical 
access rights to the extent relied upon for the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements. This resulted in the identification of certain control deficiencies with respect 
to access rights, change management processes and segregation of duties. We performed 
procedures over management’s remediation activities and additional substantive audit 
procedures to mitigate the related audit risk. 
Key  The combination of the tests of controls and the substantive tests performed provided 
observations   sufficient appropriate evidence for the purposes of our audit.

Description of responsibilities for the financial statements 
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is 
responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation 
of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks 
mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast 
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.  
 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. 
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient 
and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. 
 
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not 
detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. 
 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.  
 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the 
audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence 
requirements.  
The our audit approach section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the 
work performed as the basis for our opinion. 
Communication 
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that 
we identify during our audit. 
In this respect we also submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with Article 11 
of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The 
information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report. 
   
 
 
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 371
   
OTHER INFORMATION
 
We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
NIBC uses, throughout its financial publications, alternative performance measures (APMs) in addition
to the figures that are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). NIBC
uses APMs to provide additional information to investors and to enhance the understanding of the
results. The APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, the figures
determined according to IFRS, CRR and CRD IV. All measures that are covered by IFRS, CRR and
CRD IV are not considered to be APMs.
NIBC uses the following APMs:
■ Dividend payout ratio, %
■ Cost/income ratio, %
■ Return on equity, %
■ Cost of risk, %
■ Impairment ratio, %
■ NPL ratio, %
■ Impairment coverage ratio, %
■ Loan-to-deposit ratio, %
■ Net interest margin, %
Investors should consider that similarly titled APMs reported by other companies may be calculated
differently. For that reason, the comparability of APMs across companies might be limited. In
accordance with the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the
following information is given in regards to the above mentioned alternative performance measures:
1. Definition of the APM;
2. Reconciliation of the APM to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total presented in
the financial statements.
NIBC’s most recent financial publications at any time are available online at our website.
Dividend pay-out ratio

Cost of risk
The cost of risk compares the total credit losses included in the income statement to the total risk
weighted assets. This measure provides meaningful information on Issuer’s performance in managing
credit losses. The cost of risk is calculated as the ratio of (i) the sum of (annualised) impairments and
the credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans (as part of the net trading income) and
to (ii) the total risk weighted assets averaged over the reporting period. With the exception of the
credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans, the elements of the cost of risk reconcile to
our financial statements and regulatory reporting. The credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans
are calculated in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and form part of the
net trading income.

Impairment coverage ratio
The impairment coverage ratio compares impaired amounts on corporate and retail exposures to
the total corporate and retail exposures, providing meaningful information on the residual risk related
to NIBC’s impaired assets. The ratio is calculated by dividing the total impairments on corporate and
retail loans by the total exposure of impaired corporate and retail loans. The elements of the
impaired coverage ratio reconcile to NIBC’s consolidated financial statements.

Loan-to-deposit ratio
The loan-to-deposit ratio compares NIBC’s loans to customers to its deposits from customers. It
provides meaningful information on Issuer’s funding and liquidity position. The loan-to-deposit ratio is
calculated by dividing the total loans and mortgage loans by the deposits from customers. The
elements of the loan-to-deposit ratio reconcile to NIBC’s balance sheet.

Net interest margin
The net interest margin is a measure to display the difference between interest income and the
amount of interest paid out to lenders, relative to the amount of interest-earning assets. It is similar to
the gross margin (or gross profit margin) of non-financial companies and provides meaningful
information on the contribution of Issuer’s business to its operating income. It is calculated as the
ratio of (i) the net interest income from the last 12 months and (ii) the 12 months moving average
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 379
OTHER INFORMATION
interest bearing assets. Interest bearing assets equal the total assets from the consolidated balance
sheet excluding equity investments, derivatives, investments in associates, property, plant and
equipment and other assets. The net interest income reconciles to the income statement of NIBC.
The average interest bearing assets cannot be directly reconciled with the financial publications of
NIBC as the monthly figures are not disclosed, however the monthly figures are prepared in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
Since the denominator of the net interest margin calculation is subject to volatility in the balance, a
moving average provides more reliable information on the underlying developments. The moving
average however does not tie back to disclosed balances. For reference purposes, the following table
shows the calculation method and the comparative outcome for 2017 when the net interest margin
is calculated on ending balances instead of moving averages.

OTHER INFORMATION
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING SCOPE
This Annual Report is an integrated report. We have chosen to combine all our financial, economic,
social and environmental information into one document because all these factors are integral to
NIBC’s strategy and operations. By providing this additional information we aim to increase
transparency for all of our stakeholders and to allow them to make a more informed assessment of
NIBC and how we are creating and sustaining value.
The non-financial key figures for this report were confirmed by the departments that are responsible
for the data. The reported non-financial key figures were reviewed by Internal Audit. Internal Audit
confirmed that nothing has come to the attention that causes them to believe that the reported non-
financial key figures for NIBC Bank N.V. are inadequately presented, in all material respects, in
accordance with the reporting criteria.
Scope
Unless specified otherwise, this report includes figures and information for NIBC Bank N.V. (including
all international offices and wholly-owned subsidiaries established by NIBC for our business
purposes).
NIBC is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. The NIBC Bank N.V. Annual Report contains details
of our progress as regards the 10 Global Compact principles.
Criteria
The contents of this Annual Report and the selection of non-financial key figures are based on the
following criteria:
■ Assessment of materiality. We report on NIBC’s strategy and the elements that we have identified
as most relevant for us as a company and for our stakeholders. Please see our Materiality
Assessment report and materiality matrix for an overview of these elements;
■ Legal and regulatory requirements. For NIBC, the principal regulatory requirements are contained
in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Banking Code and the Dutch Decree on
disclosure of non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiële informatie), which
came into effect on 24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330). Please see the Corporate
Governanceno target-node sector for more details.
Accountability and reporting standards
NIBC follows the reporting criteria and guidelines of the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
Standards. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. The
GRI content index and glossary of definitions can be found in the appendices available on our
website.
The methodology used for the calculation of indicators for 2019 is the same as for 2018 unless
otherwise stated in the definitions for non-financial key figures. 
Materiality Assessment
We engaged with our stakeholders to verify the focus of our sustainability strategy and materiality in
reporting. This materiality assessment process and the outcomes are described here and form the
basis for our Annual Report.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 381
OTHER INFORMATION
Stakeholder consultation confirmed the four most important aspects for stakeholders were financial
performance, client satisfaction, climate change, and product responsibility. Given their importance to
stakeholders, NIBC will focus on in these areas while continuing to prioritize our efforts across the
other aspects which stakeholders found to be most material.
382 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
OTHER INFORMATION
DEFINITIONS FOR THE NON-FINANCIAL KEY FIGURES
The following definitions have been used for the Non Financial Key Figures presented in NIBC’s
annual report.
NPS
Outcome of Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey with corporate lending and advisory clients, who
executed a (lending) deal/deals with NIBC Corporate Banking during the reporting period, and for
existing lending and advisory clients of NIBC.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our corporate lending and
advisory clients as well as an indicator of stakeholder engagement.
The NPS methodology is a widely used methodology in which scores from 0 to 6 are classified as
'detractor', scores. 7 or 8 are classified as 'passive' and only those scores that are 9 or 10 are
classified as 'promoters'. The result is calculated by the percentage of promoters minus the
percentage of detractors, giving the NPS. The NPS can therefore range from -100% to +100%.
The NPS is measured over a 12 month period, from the 1st December to the 30th November each
year. It takes place in four batches and each respondent weighs the same in the score. It is calculated
over the corporate lending and advisory client base, where we are in direct contact with the client,
excluding distressed asset clients, internal clients and certain legacy clients. In case of multiple deals for
one client, the client is counted once. When the online survey is sent to multiple contact persons for
a client, only the first response is included.
The total population of NIBC corporate clients in scope is 598 clients in the 12 month period. 400
clients fall within the definition described above and were surveyed, 122 responses were received.
NIBC considers this to be representative of the total population. The online surveys are sent by a
third party service provider, which transfers the raw results back to NIBC.
NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction Score
The results of the latest, annual online Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) for the bank's retail clients,
i.e. NIBC Direct Savings Netherlands (NL, including Mortgages), Belgium (BE) and Germany (GE, also
including Brokerage clients), that was completed in the reporting period.
The digital surveys were conducted in November 2019 through a third party, using a random
selection of NIBC’s new and existing Dutch NIBC Direct Mortgage and Savings clients, Belgian NIBC
Direct Savings clients and German NIBC Direct Savings and Brokerage clients. Clients were selected
based amongst other criteria on country and product. The average scores per country and product
are totaled and divided by the total number of clients in the population. In 2018 we used the same
calculation method as in 2019.
2019 score per product: Netherlands Mortgages 8.0; Netherlands Savings 7.8; Germany Savings 7.8;
Germany Brokerage 8.0; Belgium Savings 8.0
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our retail clients as well as an
indicator of stakeholder engagement.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019 383
OTHER INFORMATION
The population of NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction survey was approx. 310.000 clients in
November 2019, of which 32479 have been surveyed (10,000 BE and GE and 12479 NL), and
around 2.700 responses were received.. NIBC considers this to be representative for the population.
% of new Corporate loans screened against sustainability policy framework
New corporate deals which have been assessed for social and environmental risks during the
reporting period. A deal may include one or more underlying facilities with different tenors as part of
a deal or loan structure. Amendments to existing deals are excluded from this figure.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator in regard to transparency. Sustainability impacts and
good corporate governance are among the financial and non-financial aspects taken into
consideration during NIBC’s corporate client engagement and financing decision processes.
Screenings were performed by Corporate Banking account managers as part of NIBC’s ongoing and
mandatory due diligence process using a third party toolkit system.
Number of New clients/transactions with increased sustainability risk assessment
Number of new (potential) clients/transactions for which increased sustainability risks were identified
using a third party toolkit assessment. This does not include monitoring of existing client files with
sustainability risks nor clients for which a sustainability risk assessment has not (yet) been completed
as the transaction is still in an early stage or was cancelled in an early stage.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of stakeholder engagement on potential sustainability
issues.
In these situations, NIBC performs enhanced sustainability due diligence into potential material
environmental, social, and governance aspects that are of potential concern.
Fines or sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations
Number of significant fines and number of non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and
regulations. The definition is limited to fines from a regulator. This excludes any pending claims and/or
litigation. Significant: values of fine > EUR 10.000 (in line with category 2 and 3 fines of AFM).
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of regulatory compliance and corporate governance of
NIBC’s own operations and day-to-day business.
NIBC includes non-punitive fines agreed as part of settlement of regular tax audits within its
interpretation of the definition for this indicator.
Number of FTE's end of year
Number of FTE's of NIBC worldwide at the end of the year. Only employees on NIBC's payroll and
having an 'internal' position are accounted for. NIBC Bank N.V. includes all its international offices as
well as NIBC Bank Deutschland AG, though excludes minor participations of the bank.
A Full Time Equivalent (FTE) represents, per employee, the total number of contract hours per week
related to the maximum number of contract hours per week (e.g. 40 hours). This maximum can
differ per NIBC office (depending on local guidelines) and kind of job contract.
Male/female ratio
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year.
384 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2019
OTHER INFORMATION
The number of males and females is based upon headcount as reported from NIBC's human
resources information management system at the end of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity in the company. NIBC
supports all types of diversity and aspires to further diversify its workplace.
Male/female ratio top management
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year. Top
management consists of management with corporate title 'Director' or 'Managing Director'.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity of top management.
Training expenses per employee
Total of training and education expenses, incurred in the current year based on average headcount
calculated by taking the headcount at the beginning and end of the year. For employees traveling for
training, this includes travel costs and any related expenses.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of the bank’s commitment to employee
development and future employability.
Absenteeism
Absenteeism is the rolling average of the latest absenteeism percentage, annualized for NIBC’s
employees in The Netherlands. The absenteeism percentage is the number of workdays lost to
absenteeism divided by the total number of available workdays, expressed as a percentage. In case of
partial absenteeism, the absenteeism percentage only reflects the actual absenteeism (non-working
hours). Maternity leave is not included in the figure.
Absenteeism rate may change as the year progresses due to previously unreported cases of
absenteeism and/or confirmation of the employee’s recovery.
Notifications of illness and recovery are submitted by NIBC to a 3rd party ARBO service
organization. NIBC uses its 3rd party health & safety services organization to report on absenteeism
figures. The absenteeism percentage relates to the absenteeism in the Netherlands only: absenteeism
in Germany, Belgium and United Kingdom is not accounted for in this figure.
Employee turnover (employees started & left)
Employee turnover consists of inflow of new employees ('started') and outflow of existing employees
('left').
Started: The number of employees that joined NIBC worldwide throughout the current calendar
year (hire date between 1-1-19 and 31-12-19), divided by total number of employees at the start of
the year.
Left: The number of employees that left NIBC worldwide throughout the calendar year divided by
the total number of employees at the start of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of employee engagement of existing employees
and further as an indicator of the bank’s position as an attractive employer.
