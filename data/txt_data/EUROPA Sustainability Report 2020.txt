FROM OUR HEAD OF ASSET MANAGEMENT CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Welcome
Throughout the past year, we have been solidifying our position as a European leader 
in sustainable real estate development and operations. This has required us to embrace 
industry-leading innovations whilst working to reduce the environmental footprint of our assets.
Since 2014, we have participated in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 
(GRESB), the global real estate industry’s most rigorous standard for sustainability 
performance; in 2019, we realised an overall 5% improvement on our 2018 score. 
To further evidence our progression, we have also achieved quantiﬁ able performance improvements:

OUR PERFORMANCE
We view the pursuit of sustainability as a prerequisite for long-term leadership 
and a key market differentiator. To be an organisation that will last for 
generations, we need to create sustainable ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial value 
for all stakeholders. We create non-ﬁ nancial value through our pursuit of 
market-leading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.
Europa holds itself accountable to report on its commitments and 
performance. Europa uses a Sustainability Scorecard to guide focus, hold us 
accountable to our targets, and drive continuous improvement. As such, the 
below table displays the key performance indicators against which Europa 
measures its overall sustainability performance year on year.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Environmental Management System
Using an EMS supports better results.
An environmental management system (EMS) 
is a framework that organisations use to manage 
their environmental impacts and ensure regulatory 
compliance. It supports better, more timely 
decisions through clear procedures, targets, 
and responsibilities.
Systematically identifying and controlling environmental risk
 At the highest level, our Environmental Management Policy forms the core 
of our EMS. It promotes environmental protection and minimises adverse 
environmental impacts. Europa’s EMS is designed to fulﬁ l the intent of the 
International Standards Organization (ISO) 14001 standard, which is an 
internationally recognised approach to environmental management. 
Plan 
The results of our materiality review, together with more in-depth 
risk assessments, are used to develop control procedures, 
objectives and targets (at asset and Fund level), with the 
overall objective of achieving continual improvement.

data excludes assets where 
they were not in ownership 
for the 48 months of the 
reporting period, and those 
with insufﬁ cient data coverage 
over the reporting period. The 
Europa portfolio has undergone 
signiﬁ cant changes in asset 
acquisition and disposal over 
the last three years; this has 
resulted in a reduced number 
of assets applicable for like-for-
like analysis.

 Target: We are on track to 
meet the target established.
 
 Electricity:Overall, electricity 
consumption has achieved 
a like-for-like reduction 
of 12% between 2018 
and 2019 data. Electricity 
performance improvements 
have been driven by enhanced 
improvement programmes at 
targeted assets, including LED 
lighting installation, operational 
control improvement and 
reduction of space heating and 
cooling energy usage.
 
 Fuels & Thermals: Like-for-like 
fuels consumption reduced by 
5.5% over the reporting period 
when comparing 2018 with 
2019 data. This contributes 
to us meeting our overall

Reporting & Ratings
The GRESB Real Estate Assessment – the industry benchmark for environmental and social impact – introduced 
signiﬁ cant changes to the GRESB survey structure and scoring methodology in 2020, which led to a fall in the global 
average GRESB score. As a result of the signiﬁ cant structural and scoring changes GRESB 2020 results are not 
comparable to 2019. For the results released in November 2020, Fund IV achieved a score of 71/100, Fund V a score of 
63/100 and EDIF 68/100. Fund IV and EDIF achieved a 3-star rating in 2020, an improvement from 2 stars in 2019. 
In 2020, theoretical scores were provided by GRESB, calculated using the 2019 assessment structure. The theoretical 
scores are as follows: Fund IV 76/100, Fund V 70/100 and EDIF 72/100. The theoretical scores indicate all funds 
maintained or improved their position, based on the 2019 assessment structure. 
In 2019, the funds achieved a rating of 2 stars for EFIV, EFV and EDIF. This was a good achievement for EDIF 
considering it was the ﬁ rst year of participation in GRESB. Fund V achieved a 70/100 score, improving on 2018’s result of 
65. EFIV also achieved a score of 70/100 which was an increase on 2018’s score of 69.
We remain proud to participate in the annual GRESB benchmarking process, providing comparable and reliable data 
on the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance of our investments. The assessments help to drive 
decision-making that leads to a more sustainable real estate industry.

MATERIALITY
Our ESG analysis serves to complement our 
objective of delivering superior long-term returns 
to our investors. In order to successfully integrate 
sustainability into our corporate strategy, Europa 
identiﬁ es internal and external stakeholders, 
conducts high-quality dialogues and ascertains what 
is meaningful and material. Through this assessment 
we balance stakeholder expectations, identify risks 
and opportunities and develop relationships, trust, 
people and communities. Our key stakeholders have 
been identiﬁ ed and prioritised according to the level 
of sustainability impact we believe our operations 
have on their day-to-day activities, and, in turn, their 
sustainability impact on our day-to-day activities. 
These impacts span our identiﬁ ed material ESG 
sustainability risks. 
As part of our Environmental Management System, 
Europa uses a materiality assessment as a strategic 
business tool, with implications beyond sustainability 
reporting. This assessment applies a sustainability 
lens to business risk, opportunity, trend-spotting 
and risk management processes. The assessment 
identiﬁ es, reﬁ nes and assesses numerous ESG 
factors that can affect our business and/or our 
stakeholders. 
In general, our material topics do not change 
signiﬁ cantly from one year to the next, so we do 
not perform detailed reassessments at deﬁ ned 
regular intervals. Instead, streamlined interim 
updates capture new issues or changing topics. 
This ongoing assessment process captures 
emerging risks, opportunities and stakeholder views 
across the business. We ensure that our materiality 
process is integral to the wider business strategy by 
involving colleagues across the business to ensure 
emerging risks or opportunities are not missed. 
We monitor evolving external aspects by working 
with third parties, but also by reviewing feedback 
from surveys, our own ESG education, and insights 
generated from our social media platforms.

THIRD PARTY VERIFICATION
Basis of our opinion
A multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and 
veriﬁ cation specialists performed work at corporate 
ofﬁ ces. We undertook the following activities:
   Review of the current corporate responsibility issues 
that could affect Europa Capital and are of interest to 
stakeholders;
   Review of Europa Capital’s approach to stakeholder 
engagement and recent outputs;
   Review of information provided to us by Europa Capital 
on its reporting and management processes relating to 
the Principles;
   Conduct interviews with Europa Capital senior 
management personnel. They are responsible for areas 
of management and stakeholder relationships covered 
by the Report. The objective of these discussions was to 
understand top level commitment and strategy related to 
corporate responsibility and Europa Capital’s governance 
arrangements, stakeholder engagement activity, 
management priorities and systems;
   Assess documentation and evidence that supported and 
substantiated claims made in the Report;
   Review the speciﬁ ed data collated at the corporate level, 
including data gathered by other parties, and statements 
made in the Report. We interviewed managers 
responsible for internal data validation, reviewed their 
work processes, and undertook sample-based audits of 
the processes for generating, gathering, and managing 
the quantitative and qualitative sustainability data;

veriﬁ cation scope.

PERFORMANCE COMMENTARY ABOUT EVORA
Inherent limitations
The absence of a signiﬁ cant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure 
non-ﬁ nancial information allows for different, but acceptable, measures and measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities. In addition, greenhouse gas quantiﬁ cation is subject to 
inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientiﬁ c knowledge used to determine emissions factors 
and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases.
