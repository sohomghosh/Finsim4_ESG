Risk Disclosures 
 
In 2012, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) formed a working group, the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF), that was mandated to develop principles for 
enhancing the risk disclosures of major banks, to recommend improvements to current risk disclosures, and to identify risk disclosure best practices used by 
major financial institutions. The EDTF published a report entitled Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks, which contains 32 recommendations. The Bank 
makes every effort to ensure overall compliance with those recommendations and is continuing to enhance its risk disclosures to meet the best practices on 
an ongoing basis. The risk disclosures required by the EDTF are provided in this Annual Report and in the document entitled Supplementary Regulatory Capital 
and Pillar 3 Disclosure available on the Bank’s website at nbc.ca.

Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis 
December 4, 2018 
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) presents the financial condition and operating results of National Bank of Canada (the Bank). 
This analysis was prepared in accordance with the requirements set out in National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations, released by the 
Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). It is based on the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2018 (the 
consolidated financial statements) and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), unless otherwise indicated. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This MD&A should 
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended October 31, 2018. All amounts are presented in 
Canadian dollars. Additional information about the Bank, including the Annual Information Form, can be obtained from the Bank’s website at nbc.ca and 
SEDAR’s website at sedar.com.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
From time to time, the Bank makes written and oral forward-looking statements, such as those contained in the Major Economic Trends section of this Annual Report, in other filings 
with Canadian securities regulators, and in other communications, for the purpose of describing the economic environment in which the Bank will operate during fiscal 2019 and the 
objectives it hopes to achieve for that period. These forward-looking statements are made in accordance with current securities legislation in Canada and the United States. They 
include, among others, statements with respect to the economy—particularly the Canadian and U.S. economies—market changes, observations regarding the Bank’s objectives and 
its strategies for achieving them, Bank-projected financial returns and certain risks faced by the Bank. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by future or 
conditional verbs or words such as “outlook,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar terms and expressions. 
By their very nature, such forward-looking statements require assumptions to be made and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific. Assumptions 
about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2019 and how that will affect the Bank’s business are among the main factors considered in setting the Bank’s 
strategic priorities and objectives and in determining its financial targets, including provisions for credit losses. In determining its expectations for economic growth, both broadly 
and in the financial services sector in particular, the Bank primarily considers historical economic data provided by the Canadian and U.S. governments and their agencies. 
There is a strong possibility that express or implied projections contained in these forward-looking statements will not materialize or will not be accurate. The Bank 
recommends that readers not place undue reliance on these statements, as a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control, could cause actual future results, 
conditions, actions or events to differ significantly from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include credit 
risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk and environmental risk, all of which are described in more 
detail in the Risk Management section beginning on page 52 of this Annual Report; general economic environment and financial market conditions in Canada, the United States and 
certain other countries in which the Bank conducts business, including regulatory changes affecting the Bank’s business, capital and liquidity; changes in the accounting policies the 
Bank uses to report its financial condition, including uncertainties associated with assumptions and critical accounting estimates; tax laws in the countries in which the Bank 
operates, primarily Canada and the United States (including the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)); changes to capital and liquidity guidelines and to the manner in 
which they are to be presented and interpreted; changes to the credit ratings assigned to the Bank; and potential disruptions to the Bank’s information technology systems, 
including evolving cyber attack risk. 
The foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these factors can be found in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report. Investors and 
others who rely on the Bank’s forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Except as 
required by law, the Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, by it or on its behalf. 
The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of interpreting the information contained herein and may not be appropriate for other 
purposes.

Financial Reporting Method 
  
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 
The Bank uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring its overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not 
calculated in accordance with GAAP, which are based on IFRS. Presenting non-GAAP financial measures helps readers to better understand how management 
analyzes results, shows the impacts of specified items on the results of the reported periods, and allows readers to assess results without the specified items 
if they consider such items not to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Bank’s operations. Securities regulators require companies to caution 
readers that non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other 
companies. 
In addition to the specified items, in fiscal 2017 the Bank had recorded a $40 million reversal ($29 million net of income taxes) to the sectoral provision 
on non-impaired loans taken for the oil and gas producer and service company portfolio and reported in the Personal and Commercial segment. In fiscal 2016, 
the provisions for credit losses had included an amount of $250 million related to that sectoral provision. Given the materiality of the sectoral provision 
recorded and presented in accordance with GAAP, it has been excluded from certain analyses in this MD&A. 
Like many other financial institutions, the Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate net interest income, non-interest income and income taxes. 
This calculation method consists of grossing up certain tax-exempt income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. 
An equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform a uniform comparison of the return on different assets 
regardless of their tax treatment.

(1)  On November 1, 2017, the Bank changed the presentation of certain Consolidated Balance Sheet items; in particular, the Purchased receivables item is now reported in Loans. As a result of 
this change, for the year ended October 31, 2017, a $204 million amount reported in Non-interest income was reclassified to Net interest income. This reclassification had no impact on Net 
income. 
(2)  The Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate Net interest income, Non-interest income and Income taxes. This calculation method consists of grossing up certain tax-exempt 
income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. An equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform 
a uniform comparison of the return on different assets regardless of their tax treatment. 
(3)  During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank recorded an amount of $9 million ($9 million net of income taxes) for its share in the integration costs incurred by Fiera Capital 
Corporation (Fiera Capital). For the year ended October 31, 2017, the total amount of these costs had been $11 million ($9 million net of income taxes) and had also included the Bank’s 
share in the integration costs arising from its equity interest in TMX Group Limited.  
(4)  During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank recorded $11 million in charges ($8 million net of income taxes) related to the Wealth Management acquisitions (2017: $19 million, 
$16 million net of income taxes). These charges consisted mostly of retention bonuses and the amortization of intangible assets.

designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated 
to the Bank’s management, including its signing officers, as appropriate, to 
allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
This Annual Report was reviewed by the Disclosure Committee, the 
Audit Committee, and the Bank’s Board of Directors (the Board), which 
approved it prior to publication. 
 
Internal Controls Over  
Financial Reporting 
 
The internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and 
that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with 
GAAP, which are based on IFRS, unless indicated otherwise as explained on 
page 10 of this MD&A. Due to inherent limitations, the ICFR may not prevent 
or detect all misstatements in a timely manner. 
The CEO and the CFO oversaw the evaluation work performed on the 
design  and  operation  of  the  Bank’s  ICFR  in  accordance  with 
Regulation 52-109. These controls were evaluated in accordance with the 
control framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway  Commission  (COSO  —  2013)  for  financial  controls  and  in 
accordance  with  the  control  framework  of  the  Control Objectives for 
Information and Related Technologies  (COBIT)  for  general  information 
technology controls.  
Based on the evaluation results, the CEO and CFO concluded, as at 
October 31, 2018, that there are no material weaknesses, that the ICFR are 
effective and provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is 
reliable,  and  that  the  Bank’s  consolidated  financial  statements  were 
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Objectives and 2018 Results 
When the Bank sets its medium-term objectives, it does not take specified 
items(1) into consideration, as they are inherently unpredictable or non-
recurring. Management therefore excludes specified items when assessing 
the Bank’s performance against its objectives. 
In  fiscal  2018,  the  Bank  recorded  $2,232  million  in  net  income 
compared to $2,024 million in fiscal 2017. Its 2018 diluted earnings per 
share stood at $5.94 versus $5.38 in 2017, and its 2018 return on common 
shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 18.4% versus 18.1% in 2017. Net income 
excluding specified items totalled $2,249 million in fiscal 2018, up 10%, and 
diluted earnings per share excluding specified items stood at $5.99, up 10% 
from $5.45. Furthermore, ROE excluding specified items was 18.5% in 2018 
versus 18.3% in 2017.

rates, thereby curbing their domestic economies even more. Fortunately,   
inflation is still under control in the United States, the Eurozone and Japan,   
enabling  the  major  central  banks  to  gradually  reduce  their  monetary 
accommodation. Global economic growth is expected to slow down to around 
3.5% next year, assuming that trade tensions between China and the United 
States do not worsen. 
 
F1  -  4coul UThneit eUd. SS.t aetceosn omy should grow at a rate of approximately 2.5% in 2019 
   thanks to massive budget stimulus and a monetary policy that is still 
accommodating. Business confidence is at a record level, which bodes well 
for employment and investment. Consumers are also very optimistic, due to 
the lowest unemployment rate in close to 50 years and wage growth that 
should support consumption in the coming quarters. 
Nevertheless, it would be surprising if the U.S. Federal Reserve raised 
interest  rates  more  than  twice  in  2019  given  that  its  actions  have 
consequences for emerging nations, which account for almost 60% of trade 
with the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. real estate sector is already 
shaken by the increase in mortgage rates. 
 
Canada 
The Canadian economy continued to do well in 2018 despite concerns 
related to real estate and household debt in a context of rising interest rates. 
The tighter conditions on granting credit for uninsured mortgages had the 
expected effect, cooling down residential real estate in the hottest, most 
expensive markets (Vancouver and Toronto). Nationally, mortgage credit is 
growing at its slowest rate in 17 years. However, we are far from the 
catastrophe some people fear, as house sales have stabilized at their 
average rate over the last 10 years, which suggests that housing prices 
should not decline significantly. The job market is tight nationwide, which 
should be reflected in good wage growth, enabling households to cope with 
future interest rate increases. The weak Canadian dollar remains favourable 
for exports, as the new United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) 
has reassured exporters, who may in turn increase their investments. With a 
federal election coming in 2019, budget stimulus cannot be ruled out, which 
could enable the economy to grow by approximately 2.0% in 2019, still 
above potential. In this context, the Bank of Canada is likely to continue 
normalizing its monetary policy. The Bank is anticipating a policy rate of 
2.5% by the end of 2019.

Financial Analysis   
 
 
Provisions for Credit Losses 
For fiscal 2018, the Bank recorded $327 million in provisions for credit 
losses (Table 6, page 98), $83 million more than the provisions recorded for 
fiscal 2017. This increase stems mainly from credit loss provisions taken for 
Personal Banking loans and Commercial Banking loans, which increased 
$15 million and $58 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018. These two increases 
stem from the provisions recorded on non-impaired loans, as a $40 million 
reversal to the sectoral provision for the oil and gas producer and service 
company loan portfolio had been recorded in fiscal 2017. In addition, the 
credit loss provisions recorded for U.S. Specialty Finance and International 
loans were up $46 million, essentially attributable to the Credigy subsidiary. 
During fiscal 2017, a $40 million increase in the collective allowance for 
credit risk on non-impaired loans had been recorded to reflect growth in the 
Bank’s overall credit portfolio. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans 
in 2018 represent 0.23% of average loans and acceptances, up from 0.19% 
in 2017, mainly due to higher credit losses on impaired loans at the Credigy 
subsidiary. 
 
Non-Interest Expenses 
In fiscal 2018, non-interest expenses stood at $4,063 million (Table 7, 
F2  -  2coul pinatgeere 9s9t )e,x ap e$n2s0e6s  mexilclliuodni ningc srepaesceif iwedhe itne mcosm rpoasere $d2 t1o4 f imscilalilo 2n0 o1r7 6, %wh. ile non-
   Compensation and employee benefits stood at $2,466 million in 2018, 
a 5% year-over-year increase resulting from a greater number of employees 
and the higher variable compensation associated with revenue growth. The 
increase in technology expenses, including amortization, came from the 
technology investments made to execute the Bank’s transformation plan and 
for business development activities. The 2018 professional fees stood at 
$244 million, a $10 million year-over-year decrease related to the servicing 
fees associated with Credigy’s business activities, whereas advertising and 
external relations expenses and other expenses were up year over year. 
Furthermore, the expansion of ABA Bank's banking network led to an overall 
increase in non-interest expenses.  
 
Income Taxes 
Detailed information about the Bank’s income taxes is provided in Note 25 to 
the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal 2018, income taxes stood at 
$544 million, for an effective tax rate of 20%, compared to $484 million and 
an effective tax rate of 19% in 2017. Credigy’s lower effective income tax rate 
arising from the U.S. tax reform was partly offset by a decrease in the value of 
deferred tax assets and by income taxes on the deemed repatriation of 
foreign profits.

Priorities and Outlook for 2019 
 
The Bank expects the strong economic fundamentals in its core Quebec market to support growth in 2019. With the business cycle in the mature phase in the 
U.S., which is a large export market for commercial clients, the Bank is comforted by the strong diversification of the Quebec economy, sound governance of 
public finances that has led to three consecutive years of provincial budget surpluses, and good visibility on major government infrastructure projects over the 
next several years. Residential housing remains affordable in Montreal and across Quebec while household debt is manageable, reflecting a historically low 
unemployment rate and the world’s second highest proportion of women in the labour force. These and other factors provide a favourable context as the Bank 
enters a new fiscal year. 
 
The Personal and Commercial segment’s 2019 performance will be driven by its execution against its priorities and its ability to balance volume growth, 
margins and credit quality. 
 
Maintain the Pace of Growth  
  Develop a retail offering that is tailored to market particularities, competition, geographic location and micromarkets.  
  Enhance marketing and capitalize on online origination features to attract new arrivals, millennials, professionals and SMEs.  
  Provide a digital savings experience that combines the strength of advisors and modern technologies to help clients reach their life goals.  
  Update the range of cash management products, adapting them to the needs of clients and helping them to manage their business’s cash cycle. 
  Achieve greater presence with specialized industries and increase market coverage to grow the Bank’s market share among small businesses in Quebec. 
 
Focus on Client Experience  
  Emphasize a team approach that offers the best advice and solutions by combining generalists and specialists. 
  Provide a simple, unified client experience by applying an integrated approach across all products and distribution channels. 
  Develop the marketing capabilities needed to conduct effective campaigns, anticipate client preferences, and personalize client interactions.  
  Modernize the client feedback process. 
  Transform the in-branch experience by supporting clients through the shift to self-service, removing physical barriers and being proactive through the 
advisory offering.  
  Help business clients to grow by giving them access to the Bank’s network of entrepreneurs. 
  Deepen relationships with business clients with the help of data analysis and digital client relationship management tools. 
 
Continue the Digital Transformation 
  Expand client self-service options by deploying new digital features such as international transfers and online credit card activation.  
  Improve the Interac payment offering by enabling business clients to send payment requests to customers and to receive direct deposits from them. 
  Make continuous improvements to the mobile application, for both retail and business clients. 
  Modernize and simplify the digital user experience for both large corporations and SMEs by deploying single sign-on features, Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) integration, and roles and access management. 
 
Focus on Efficiency 
  Simplify the product offering, digitize and automate key processes. 
  Automate our click-to-chat/chatbot dialogue mechanisms in order to personalize certain client interactions on a mass scale and make the Customer 
Contact Centres more accessible. 
  Continue simplification and unification of the core client lifecycle activities, whether they be retail clients (account opening, payments, home purchase 
and saving) or business clients (account opening, financing and cash management).

In the Personal and Commercial segment, net income totalled $948 million in 
fiscal 2018, up 5% from $903 million in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2018 net  4%
income was up 8% when compared to the net income excluding the impact of 
the sectoral provision on non-impaired loans for the oil and gas producer and  13%
service company loan portfolio, which had been reversed by $29 million, net 
of  income  taxes,  in  fiscal  2017.  The  segment’s  total  revenues  rose 
$182 million or 6% year over year, as net interest income grew $143 million 
while non-interest income grew $39 million. The increase in net interest 
income was driven primarily by higher personal and commercial loan and 
deposit volumes as well as by a wider net interest margin, which rose to  45%
2.32% in 2018 from 2.26% in 2017 owing mainly to growth in deposit 
margins. 
The segment’s 2018 non-interest expenses stood at $1,720 million, a 
3% year-over-year increase resulting mainly from higher compensation and 
employee benefits, operations support charges, and technology investment 
expenses. Given these results, the segment’s 2018 contribution increased 
38%
10% year over year. Furthermore, at 53.1%, the segment’s 2018 efficiency 
ratio improved by 1.6 percentage points from 54.7% in 2017 (57.3% in 
2016).
For 2018, the segment recorded $226 million in provisions for credit 
losses, $73 million more than the $153 million recorded in 2017. This 
Personal Banking (2017: 46%) 
increase was mainly due to the $40 million reversal of the sectoral provision  Commercial Banking (2017: 37%) 
in fiscal 2017 as well as to higher credit loss provisions on personal and  Payment Solutions (2017: 13%) 
commercial loans, in particular provisions recorded for non-impaired loans  Insurance (2017: 4%) 
and for credit card receivables.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
 
 
 
Business Segment Analysis | Wealth Management 
 
As a leader in Quebec and firmly established across Canada, the Wealth Management segment serves all market segments by emphasizing advisory services 
and close client relationships. It delivers a full range of wealth management products and solutions through a multi-channel distribution network and a 
differentiated business model. The Wealth Management segment also offers investment solutions to independent advisors as well as solutions to institutional 
clients.  
 
Business Lines 
 
Investment Solutions  
National Bank Investments (NBI) manufactures and offers mutual funds, investment solutions, and services to consumers and institutional investors through 
the Bank’s extended network. With its open architecture model, NBI is Canada’s largest investment fund manager to entrust the management of its 
investments exclusively to external portfolio managers.  
 
Full-Service Brokerage 
Drawing on the largest network of investment advisors in Quebec, National Bank Financial - Wealth Management (NBFWM) provides wealth management 
advisory services through close to 1,000 advisors at over 100 service points across Canada. Its advisors serve over 400,000 retail clients, proposing portfolio 
management services, financial and succession planning, and insurance and pension services while working in close collaboration with other segments of the 
Bank.  
 
Private Banking 
Private Banking 1859 offers highly personalized wealth management services and advice across Canada, helping affluent clients to benefit from 
comprehensive management of their personal and family fortunes. As a true market leader in Quebec, Private Banking 1859 continues to expand its operations 
across Canada with its extensive range of financial solutions covering the protection, growth and transition of wealth. 
 
Direct Brokerage 
National Bank Direct Brokerage (NBDB) offers a multitude of financial products and investment tools to self-directed investors across Canada through its online 
investment solution. NBDB helps customers who want to manage their own investments to do so through a trading platform, through an optimized mobile 
trading platform, or by speaking directly to a representative on the phone.  
 
Administrative and Trade Execution Services 
National Bank Independent Network (NBIN) is a Canadian leader in providing administrative services, such as trade execution, custodial services, and 
brokerage solutions to many independent financial services firms across Canada, in particular to introducing brokers, portfolio managers, and investment fund 
managers.   
 
Transaction and Credit Products 
The Wealth Management segment provides independent advisors across Canada with an extensive range of investment products, including GICs, mutual 
funds, notes, structured products and monetization, helping to support their own business needs and client relationships. It also offers banking services such 
as investment loans, mortgages and other financial products, in partnership with non-bank financial institutions seeking to expand their service offering to 
their own clients.

offers a full range of high value-added services designed to consolidate, protect and transfer its customers’ wealth and give them peace of mind. It also offers 
integrated trustee and depository services as well as securities custody services.  
 
Economic and Market Review 
 
The tightening of monetary policy continued in 2018, and additional rate hikes by the Bank of Canada are expected in 2019. Barring any unexpected economic 
shocks, economic growth will probably continue despite the rising cost of money. The markets reached the maturity phase of their cycle in 2018, but this could 
last into the foreseeable future. 
 
The financial services industry is still experiencing rapid change, and demographic transition will play a decisive role in its evolution. Several factors are 
reshaping the industry’s demand curve, including the transfer of wealth from the children of the Great Depression, baby-boomers transitioning into retirement, 
a resurgence of Generation X into accumulation mode, and the arrival of millennial households.  
 
In the coming years, technological excellence capable of providing clients with the most relevant, personalized experience will be needed to win the client 
retention battle. With the multitude of solutions being offered by new industry players (FinTechs), the development of artificial intelligence applications is 
becoming a major differentiating factor in the industry. On the regulatory front, many consultations are under way and could require even more adjustments in 
the future.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis   
   
 
  
Business Segment Analysis | Financial Markets 
 
The Financial Markets segment offers a full range of products and services to corporate, government and institutional clients. Whether providing 
comprehensive advisory services, macroeconomic and issuer-focused research, or capital markets services, its focus is on client relationships and their 
growth.  Over 700 professionals serve client needs through offices in North America, Europe, the U.K. and Asia.  
 
Lines of Business 
 
The Financial Markets segment operates two main business lines: Global Markets and Corporate and Investment Banking. 
  
Global Markets 
Financial Markets is a Canadian leader in risk management solutions and structured products and is the largest market-maker in exchange-traded funds in 
Canada by volume. The financial and business risks of its clients are mitigated through solutions covering interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equities and 
commodities. The segment offers structuring advice to asset managers and fund companies for new product development and supports their success by 
providing liquidity, research and counterparty services. It also issues tailored investment products in all asset classes to institutional and retail investors. 
 
Corporate and Investment Banking 
Financial Markets offers loan origination and syndication to corporations for project financing, merger and acquisition transactions, and general corporate 
purposes. The segment is also an investment banking leader across Canada and the overall top-ranked franchise in Quebec. Its comprehensive services 
include strategic advisory for financing and mergers and acquisitions as well as debt and equity underwriting. It is the Canadian leader in government and 
corporate high yield debt underwriting. Dominant in Quebec, it leads deals for provincial and municipal governments across Canada while growing its national 
position in infrastructure and project financing. Financial Markets is active in securitization financing, mainly Government-of-Canada-insured mortgages and 
mortgage-backed securities. 
 
Economic and Market Review 
 
Financial Markets started fiscal 2018 very strong as our flexible approach to capital allocation provided us with the ability to seize opportunities in the 
securities finance business. Plagued by periods of volatility, domestic equity offerings fell drastically. However, the segment achieved strong progress building 
its M&A franchise through several landmark transactions. Results for the second half of 2018 were influenced by global trade tensions and strong economic 
fundamentals in Canada.

diversification of the Bank’s deposit base. This 2018 issuance amount represents an increase of almost 
$900 million from 2017.

Maintain leadership in investment    Given reduced ETF market volume in 2018, the ETF market-making team captured almost 40% market

Financial Results  Total Revenues by Category 
Year ended October 31, 2018  
In the Financial Markets segment, net income totalled $764 million in fiscal  (taxable equivalent basis)(1) 
2018, up $66 million or 9% from fiscal 2017. Total revenues on a taxable 
equivalent basis amounted to $1,743 million compared to $1,618 million in  3%
fiscal 2017, a $125 million increase driven by all revenue types except for 
gains  on  investments  and  other  revenues.  Due  to  favourable  market 
conditions in fiscal 2018, global markets revenues increased 7% year over  22%
year. Specifically, revenues from equity securities and from commodity and 
foreign exchange activities grew 14% and 22%, respectively, while fixed-
income revenues declined 10%. Revenues from financial market fees were up 
15%,  particularly  due  to  solid  performance  in  merger  and  acquisition 
business. Furthermore, corporate banking revenues grew 15% year over year 
owing to more robust lending activity. Lastly, higher gains on investments 
and  other  revenues  had  been  recorded  in  fiscal  2017,  whereas  the  55%
$164 million  write-off  ($145 million  net  of  income  taxes)  of  the  equity

Business Segment Analysis | U.S. Specialty Finance and International 
 
The Bank complements its Canadian growth with a targeted and disciplined international strategy that aims for higher returns and offers additional strategic 
options for capital deployment. The Bank is currently focused on specialty finance in the U.S. through Credigy and on personal and commercial banking in 
Cambodia through ABA Bank. During fiscal 2018, the U.S. Specialty Finance and International segment generated 9% of consolidated total revenue and 10% of 
net income. 
 
U.S. Specialty Finance – Credigy 
Credigy is a specialty finance company with flexibility across its capital structure to acquire or finance all segments of the consumer receivables market. Based 
in Atlanta, the company is primarily active in performing assets covering a broad range of asset classes, mostly in the U.S. market. The Bank holds an 80% 
ownership interest in Credigy. 
 
Economic and Market Review 
 
U.S. consumer credit is expected to reach record levels in 2018, fueled by strong economic growth and low unemployment, despite four interest rate hikes by 
the Federal Reserve during the year. Significant increases in overall market liquidity in the U.S. are creating short-term pressure on net spreads in specialty 
finance.

both bank and non-bank financial institutions. While building its deal pipeline, the company continuously refines and enhances its modelling and analytics 
tools to optimize pricing and servicing of the consumer receivables portfolios. Market conditions are expected to remain neutral in 2019 in an environment of 
strong credit expansion. Credigy’s diversification will permit continued growth, albeit at slower rates in the current market conditions and until spreads widen.

Cambodian market, focusing on MSME clients to achieve loan growth while increasing its stable deposit base by leveraging the Bank’s reputation and offering 
convenience to retail customers through its advanced digital and self-banking infrastructure and expanding branch network. It plans to open an additional six 
to eight branches in 2019 to extend its reach into new regions of the country and gain direct access to a larger pool of MSME customers and retail deposits.

its moratorium on making significant new investments in emerging markets until 2020.

Financial Results  Total Revenues by Category 
Year ended October 31, 2018 
For the year ended October 31, 2018, the USSF&I segment generated 
$222 million in net income compared to $184 million in fiscal 2017. Its 2018 
total revenues amounted to $639 million versus $541 million in 2017; this 
18% revenue growth was driven by an increase in Credigy’s revenues, 
particularly due to growth in loan volumes, and by growth in ABA Bank’s  30%
revenues, which increased steadily due to higher loan and deposit volumes.  
The segment’s 2018 non-interest expenses stood at $251 million, a 
$26 million year-over-year increase attributable essentially to the ABA Bank 
non-interest  expenses  incurred  to  expand  its  banking  network.  As  for 
Credigy’s  non-interest  expenses,  they  were  down  4%  year  over  year, 
primarily as a result of lower servicing fees. 
For 2018, the segment recorded $94 million in provisions for credit 
losses, consisting essentially of Credigy’s credit loss provisions.

Financial Results   
 
 
For  the  Other heading  of  segment  results,  there  was  a  net  loss  of   
$191 million in fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $169 million in fiscal   
2017. This change was mainly due to an increase in non-interest expenses, 
particularly technology investment expenses made as part of the Bank’s 
transformation plan and for business development activities, and to a higher 
contribution from Treasury activities in 2017. These items more than offset 
the expected favourable impact on fiscal 2018 of the $40 million increase 
($29 million net of income taxes) recorded for the collective allowance for 
credit risk on non-impaired loans in fiscal 2017 to reflect growth in the 
Bank’s overall credit portfolio.

Quarterly Financial Information 
 
Several trends and factors have an impact on the Bank’s quarterly net income, revenues, non-interest expenses and provisions for credit losses. For example, 
the second quarter of the fiscal year has fewer days than the other quarters, which can result in reductions to total revenues and certain non-interest expense 
items. The following table presents a summary of results for the past eight quarters. Furthermore, a summary of results for the past 12 quarters is provided in 
Table 1 on pages 94 and 95.

The provisions for credit losses in every quarter of fiscal 2018 were 
affected by the application of IFRS 9 on November 1, 2017. They posted year-

recorded on non-impaired personal and commercial loans and to provisions 
recorded for the U.S. Specialty Finance and International segment and 
related essentially to the Credigy subsidiary. Furthermore, during the second 
quarter of 2017, the Bank had recorded a $40 million reversal to the sectoral 
provision on non-impaired loans taken for the oil and gas producer and 
service company loan portfolio. The 2017 second-quarter provisions for 
credit losses had also included a $40 million increase in the collective 
allowance for credit risk on non-impaired loans.

Securitization and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Bank uses various types of derivative financial instruments to meet its 
clients’ needs, generate trading activity revenues and manage its exposure 
to interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk as well as other market 
risks. All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value on 
the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  Transactions  in  derivative  financial 
instruments are expressed as notional amounts. These amounts are not 
presented as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. They 
represent the face amount of the contract to which a rate or price is applied 
to determine the amount of cash flows to be exchanged. Notes 1 and 17 to 
the consolidated financial statements provide additional information on the 
types  of  derivative  financial  instruments  used  by  the  Bank  and  their 
accounting basis. 
 
Guarantees 
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various guarantee 
contracts.  The  principal  types  of  guarantees  are  letters  of  guarantee, 
backstop  liquidity  and  credit  enhancement  facilities,  certain  securities 
lending activities, and certain indemnification agreements. Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements provides detailed information on these 
guarantees. 
 
Credit Instruments 
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-
sheet credit commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the financing 
needs of its clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit that 
the Bank could be required to extend if the commitments were fully drawn. 
For additional information on these off-balance-sheet credit instruments and 
other items, see Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Financial Assets Received as Collateral 
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank receives financial assets as 
collateral as a result of transactions involving securities purchased under 
reverse  repurchase  agreements,  securities  borrowing  and  lending 
agreements, and derivative financial instrument transactions. For additional 
information regarding financial assets received as collateral, see Note 27 to

RWA by Key Risk Drivers 
CET1 RWA amounted to $73.7 billion as at October 31, 2018, rising $3.5 billion from $70.2 billion as at October 31, 2017. This organic growth in RWA was 
partly offset by an improved portfolio quality and an updating of the models. The changes in the Bank’s risk-weighted assets by risk type are presented in the

Risk Management   
 
In this section of the MD&A, grey-shaded text and tables marked with an asterisk (*) are integral parts of the consolidated financial statements. They 
represent the Bank’s objectives, the risk management policies and procedures, and the methods applied to measure credit risk, market risk as well as 
liquidity and funding risk, as required by IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures. 
 
The Bank views risk as an integral part of its development and the diversification of its activities. It advocates a risk management approach consistent with its 
 
business expansion strategy. The purpose of sound risk management is to provide reasonable assurance that incurred risks do not exceed acceptable 
thresholds and that risk-taking contributes to the creation of shareholder value. For the Bank, this means striking a healthy balance between return and risk. 
The Bank is exposed to risk in two ways. First, it voluntarily exposes itself to certain risk categories, particularly credit and market risk, in order to 
generate revenue. Second, it assumes risks that are inherent to its activities—to which it does not choose to expose itself—and that do not generate revenue, 
i.e., mainly operational risk. These risks may result in losses that could adversely affect future earnings. 
 
Top and Emerging Risks 
 
Top and emerging risks are risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial results, reputation or long-term business model and strategy. 
The Bank’s processes are designed to detect and assess these risks as early as possible so that appropriate mitigating strategies can be applied. The Bank’s 
  F4  -  2coul t op andR eimske rging risks aTrer eans dfo llows.  Description 
 
Currently, the main global risks consist of slowing economic growth in certain emerging countries. In recent years, 
U.S.-dollar debt levels in certain countries have risen sharply, and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar could compromise 
the creditworthiness of certain borrowers. Similarly, a variety of geopolitical tensions remain a source of concern. The 
adoption  of  protectionist  measures  could  also  undermine  international  trade.  Among  other  things,  the  U.S. 
administration brings its share of concerns about future policies that might affect the Canadian and Quebec economies. 
Protectionism directed at Canada could adversely affect certain industries and slow trade, negatively affecting export 
Global  clients in turn. Escalating trade tensions between China and the U.S. could compromise global economic expansion and 
economic  cause collateral damage, in particular to the Canadian economy. In addition, the rising nationalism and waves of 
 
risks  displacement toward Western Europe continue to stoke fears. 
Given the exceptional monetary measures taken by central banks combined with mild economic growth and low 
inflation, long-term interest rates have remained low for a long time in advanced economies. Such a situation could 
have prompted market participants to adopt excessive risk-taking strategies in search of higher returns, the negative 
effects of which may be felt if interest rates return to normal faster than expected, particularly in the U.S. Therefore, the 
Bank is remaining vigilant and continuing to rely on its strong risk management framework to identify, assess and 
mitigate risk so that it remains within the risk appetite limits. 
 
 
The domestic energy sector struggled in the wake of the global oil supply shock but is gradually adapting to the new 
environment. In the event that oil and gas prices fall again, producers may face obstacles that will negatively affect 
their ability to repay debt and that will erode the quality of their credit. While provinces that produce fossil energy 
resources saw positive economic growth in the first half of 2018, their unemployment rates remained high, and the 
recent drop in oil prices pose additional challenges. Sound economic and financial conditions in the three largest 
provinces (Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia) continue to support a credit environment favourable to the loan 
portfolios. Still, Canada remains vulnerable to a deteriorating economic backdrop, which threatens to erode job 
Economic risks  creation and disposable household income—even more so given the high household debt levels. Economic growth, and 
in Canada    more specifically the housing market, has been stimulated in recent years by very low interest rates. An unexpected 
jump in inflation represents a risk to the Canadian economy to the extent that it could prompt the Bank of Canada to 
quickly cut back its monetary stimulus. Should this occur, real estate assets, among others, would be vulnerable to a 
price correction, and tighter mortgage rules remain an issue for Canadian households.  
The Bank also monitors international developments that may affect the Canadian economy. As mentioned, U.S. 
protectionism has cast substantial uncertainty over the trade relationship between Canada and the United States and 
other economic partners. These uncertainties have significantly destabilized certain sectors, and the Bank has 
responded by continuing to monitor market developments and remaining vigilant in line with its risk tolerance policy.

Risk  Trend  Description 
 
Technology has become a major part of the banking industry’s operations, in particular the ever-increasing use of 
mobile, wireless and web-enabled devices. Despite the Bank’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems and 
information, it is exposed to the risks associated with data breaches, malicious software, unauthorized access, 
hacking, phishing, identity theft, intellectual property theft, asset theft, industrial espionage and possible denial of 
service due to activities causing network failures and service interruptions. It is also possible for the Bank to be unable 
to prevent or implement effective preventive measures against every potential cyber-threat, as the tactics used are 
multiplying, change frequently, come from a wide range of sources and are increasingly sophisticated.  
Disruptions to or malfunctions in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support the Bank and its

and security  reputational damage; compliance, corrective measures, investigative, or restoration costs; cost hikes to maintain and 
breaches  upgrade technological infrastructures and systems, all of which could affect the Bank’s operating results or financial 
position.  
To protect its customers, the Bank actively monitors and manages its control environment as well as evolving 
cyber threats around the world. It continues to improve its existing processes and practices to identify risks, protect 
information assets, and detect and respond to potential threats. The Bank continually assesses the effectiveness of its 
key controls through testing and through internal and external assessments of its current practices. The Bank is also 
investing in multiple projects designed to better protect itself against cyber attacks, comply with industry standards, 
and  continually  improve  security  controls.  The  Board’s  Risk  Management  Committee  is  regularly  informed  of 
cybersecurity trends and developments to gain a better understanding of potential cybersecurity risks. 
 
 
The Bank is reliant on technology, as clients are seeking greater access to products and services on a variety of 
platforms and because many of its products and services require substantial processing of data, much of which is 
confidential. As such, the Bank’s technology platform must be able to manage all such data. The fast pace of 
technological  change  combined  with  both  client  and  competitive  pressures  require  significant  and  sustained 
investment in technology. Unsuccessful implementation of technological improvements or new products or services 
could significantly affect the Bank’s ability to serve and retain clients.  
Third  parties  provide  essential  components  of  the  Bank’s  technological  infrastructure  such  as  Internet 
Reliance on  connections and access to network and other communications services. The Bank also relies on the services of third 
technology  parties for support in its IT activities and in the handling of certain business processes that involve sharing confidential 
and third  information. An interruption of these services or a breach of security could have an unfavourable impact on the Bank’s 
 
parties  ability to provide products and services to its customers and to conduct business, not to mention the impact it would 
have on the Bank’s reputation. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has a third-party-related risk management framework 
that includes business continuity plans, which are tested periodically to ensure their effectiveness in times of crisis. A 
multitude of checks on information security and on financial health and performance are conducted before any 
agreement is reached and for the duration thereof. Despite these preventive measures and the efforts deployed by the 
Bank’s teams to manage third parties, there remains a possibility that certain risks will materialize. In such cases, the 
Bank would then rely on the contingency and mitigation measures established in collaboration with the third parties. 
The Bank is aware of the significance of third-party-related risks and continues to develop its practices in this regard. 
 
 
The Bank’s financial performance depends on its ability to develop and market new and innovative products and 
services, adopt and develop new technologies that help differentiate its products and services and generate cost 
Technological  savings, and market these new products and services at the right time and at competitive prices. Failure to properly 
innovation  review critical changes within the business before and during the implementation and deployment of key technological 
 
systems or failure to align client expectations with the Bank’s client commitments and operating capabilities could 
adversely affect the Bank’s operating results or financial position.

Judicial and Regulatory Proceedings  
The  Bank  takes  reasonable  measures  to  comply  with  the  laws  and 
regulations in effect in the jurisdictions where it operates. Should these 
measures  prove  ineffective,  the  Bank  could  be  subject  to  judicial  or 
regulatory  decisions  resulting  in  fines,  damages,  or  other  costs  or  to 
restrictions likely to adversely affect its operating results or its reputation. 
The Bank may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business. 
Although the Bank establishes provisions for the measures it is subject to 
under accounting requirements, actual losses resulting from such litigation 
could differ significantly from the recognized amounts, and unfavourable 
outcomes in such cases could have a significant adverse effect on the Bank’s 
operating results. The resulting reputational damage could also affect the 
Bank’s future business prospects. For additional information, see Note 27 to 
the consolidated financial statements.

Risk Management   
 
  
Risk Management Framework 
 
Risk is rigorously managed. That means it is identified, measured and controlled to ensure that the Bank’s operations yield an adequate return for the level of 
risk assumed. Managing risk requires a solid understanding of every type of risk found across the Bank. In addition to providing assurance that risk levels do 
not exceed acceptable thresholds, effective risk management can be used to control the volatility of the Bank's results.  
Despite the exercise of stringent risk management and the mitigation measures in place, risk cannot be suppressed entirely, and the residual risks may 
occasionally cause significant losses. In the normal course of business, the Bank is primarily exposed to the risks presented below.

—  fact-based: good risk management relies heavily on common sense and   
judgment and on advanced systems and models. 
 
Risk Appetite and Reporting 
Risk-taking is intrinsic to a financial institution’s business. Business unit 
strategies have always—implicitly or explicitly—incorporated decisions about 
the amount of risk they are willing to assume. Risk appetite represents how 
much risk an organization is willing to assume to achieve its business 
strategy. The Bank cultivates a risk management culture that is aligned with 
its risk appetite, doing so by setting risk tolerance thresholds that determine 
its risk-taking capacity. 
The Bank’s risk appetite framework consists of principles, statements, 
metrics as well as targets and is reinforced by policies and limits. It is 
defined both quantitatively and qualitatively and requires: 
 
—  a strong credit rating to be maintained;  
—  a risk-reward balance; 
—  a stable risk profile; 
—  a strategic level of concentration aligned with approved targets; 
—  a strong capital position; 
—  a strong liquidity position; 
—  a low tolerance to operational and reputation risk; 
—  a rigorous management of regulatory compliance risk, including sales 
practices; 
—  operational  and  information  systems  stability  in  both  normal 
circumstances and crisis. 
 
The Bank’s management and business units are involved in the process 
for setting the risk appetite and are responsible for adequately monitoring 
the chosen key risk indicators. These needs are assessed by means of the 
enterprise strategic planning process. The risk indicators are reported on a 
regular basis to ensure an effective alignment of the Bank’s risk profile to its 
risk appetite; otherwise, appropriate actions could be taken. Additional 
information on the key credit, market and liquidity risk indicators monitored 
by the Bank’s management is presented on the following pages.

policy presents the main mechanisms used for identifying and measuring the   
types of market risk to which the Bank is exposed, most of which are   
described on the previous page. It also defines the link between the Bank’s 
market risk appetite approved by the Board and the framework implemented 
for setting market risk limits across all the Bank’s business units that are 
allowed to undertake market risk. The purpose of the market risk limits is to 
set out tolerance thresholds for these business units or portfolios to comply 
with the Bank’s market risk appetite targets. These are cascaded down to 
business units using a hierarchy of different types of limits (e.g., Value at 
Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR), stress testing), as well as an appropriate 
breach escalation process.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 
The LCR was introduced primarily to ensure banks maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand periods of severe short-term stress. OSFI has been requiring 
Canadian banks to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. An LCR above 100% ensures that banks are holding sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover 
net cash outflows given a severe, 30-day liquidity crisis. The assumptions underlying the LCR scenario were established by the BCBS and OSFI. 
The following table provides average LCR data calculated using the daily figures in the quarter. For the quarter ended October 31, 2018, the Bank’s 
average LCR was 147%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement and demonstrating the Bank’s solid liquidity position.

(1)  OSFI prescribed a table format in order to standardize disclosure throughout the banking industry. 
(2)  Unweighted values are calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows). 
(3)  Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates. 
(4)  Total adjusted values are calculated after the application of both haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and any applicable caps. 
(5)  The data in this table has been calculated using averages of the daily figures in the quarter. 
 
Level 1 liquid assets represent 87% of the Bank’s HQLA, which includes cash, central bank deposits, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the Canadian 
government and Canadian provincial governments. 
Cash outflows arise from the application of OSFI-prescribed assumptions on deposits, debt, secured funding, commitments and additional collateral 
requirements. The cash outflows are partly offset by cash inflows, which come mainly from secured loans and performing loans. The Bank expects some 
quarter-over-quarter variation between reported LCRs, and such variation may not be indicative of a trend. The variation between the quarter ended 
October 31, 2018 and the previous quarter was a result of normal business activities. The Bank’s liquid asset buffer is well in excess of its total net cash 
outflows.  
The LCR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures presented in the tables on the previous pages or those used for 
internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework was prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank’s internal liquidity metrics use 
C_rapport assum ptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.

Recovery and Resolution Planning  
As part of the regulatory measures used to manage systemic risks, D-SIBs 
are required to have in place recovery and resolution plans. A recovery plan 
is essentially a road map that guides the recovery of a Bank in the event of 
severe financial stress; conversely, a resolution plan guides its orderly wind-
down in the event of failure when recovery is no longer an option. The Bank 
develops and periodically updates its recovery and resolution plans to 
prepare for these high-risk, but low-probability events. These plans are 
presented to its domestic regulatory authorities. The Bank also works on 
documenting a resolution plan with Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(CDIC) that would ensure orderly winding down of the Bank’s operations.

Risk Management   
 
  
Environmental Risk Management 
 
Environmental risk is the risk of a loss or damage to the Bank’s reputation 
arising from environmental concerns related to the Bank or its clients. 
Environmental risk is often associated with credit risk and operational risk. 
Environmental risk is defined as any impact arising from environmental 
issues (such as climate change, pollution and waste management) that 
causes a loss of financial value or operating value or that damages the 
Bank’s reputation. This risk arises from commercial and operating activities. 
For  example,  environmental  issues  related  to  the  purchase  or  sale  of 
contaminated properties by clients of the Bank or the deployment of large-
scale projects could expose the Bank to credit and reputation risk. The Bank 
has set up a series of eco-responsible measures that allow for better 
management of greenhouse gas emissions arising from its activities and for 
a cleaner environment. The Bank is a signatory to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project, which collects and publishes information disclosed by companies 
worldwide  regarding  their  management  of  climate  change  and  their 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  
The Bank would also be forced to deal with operational risk and the risk 
related to the legal environment when environmental issues arise in its 
branches or administrative offices. 
In this context, the Risk Management Group develops requirements that 
are prescribed in its internal policies in order to reveal, assess, control and 
monitor environmental risk. For their part, the business segments and 
corporate units must integrate requirements and controls related to the 
management of environmental risk in their activities. The Risk Management 
Group monitors its application and regularly reviews the standards. Each 
year, the Bank publishes its Social Responsibility Report, which is available 
on its website at nbc.ca. 
The Bank believes that it has a role to play in the fight against climate 
change. It supports the global community’s efforts to move towards an 
economy  that  is  more  respectful  of  the  environment  and  towards  a 
sustainable economic development model that is low in GHG emissions. 
Having given its support to the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCDF), the Bank has committed to 
ensuring that its disclosures include relevant information on the various 
topics addressed by this group. In addition, in collaboration with industry 
partners, the Bank is working to develop a coherent and useful framework for 
disclosing climate-change-related financial data.  
The Bank continues to identify and measure climate-related risks. It 
leads by example by focusing on energy efficiency, reducing the intensity of 
its GHG emissions, and incorporating sustainable building principles into the 
design and operation of its establishments. The Bank also monitors the 
leading thinking, coming from provincial and national authorities, on climate 
issues.

Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of

Transition Impact 
For the Bank, the transition to IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on 
when revenue from contracts with customers is recognized. However, the 
presentation of certain revenues and certain non-interest expenses in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income will change, as gross amounts will have to 
be presented. At this time, certain revenues are presented net of certain non-
interest expenses. This presentation change will not have a significant 
impact on the Bank. Upon transition, IFRS 15 permits entities to either 
restate prior periods or to apply the standard on a modified retrospective 
basis. The Bank has chosen to apply the standard using the modified 
retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the 
standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings as at 
November 1, 2018, without restating comparative periods. This adjustment 
to the opening balance of Retained earnings as at November 1, 2018 will not 
be significant.

(1)  On November 1, 2017, the Bank changed the presentation of certain Consolidated Balance Sheet items; in particular, the Purchased receivables item is now reported in Loans. As a result of 
this change, a $204 million amount (2016: $213 million) reported in Non-interest income was reclassified to Net interest income for the year ended October 31, 2017. This reclassification 
had no impact on Net income.   
(2)  Subordinated debt. 
(3)  Given the adoption of IFRS 9, all loans classified in Stage 3 of the expected credit loss model are impaired loans and do not include POCI loans. Under IAS 39, loans were considered 
impaired according to different criteria. Net impaired loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on Stage 3 loan amounts drawn.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Reporting   
 
 
The consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada (the Bank) have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), 
which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI), the financial statements are to be 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS 
represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
Management maintains the accounting and internal control systems needed to discharge its responsibility, which is to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial accounts are accurate and complete and that the Bank’s assets are adequately safeguarded. Controls that are currently in place include quality 
standards on staff hiring and training; the implementation of organizational structures with clear divisions of responsibility and accountability for 
performance; the Code of Professional Conduct; and the communication of operating policies and procedures.  
 
As Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer, we have overseen the evaluation of the design and operation of the Bank’s internal controls over 
financial reporting in accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosures in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings released by the 
Canadian Securities Administrators. Based on the evaluation work performed, we have concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting were

   maintained. Composed of directors who are neither officers nor employees of the Bank, the Audit Committee is responsible, through Internal Audit, for 
performing an independent and objective review of the Bank’s internal control effectiveness, i.e., governance processes, risk management processes and 
control measures. Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviews the consolidated financial statements and recommends their approval to the Board. 
 
The control systems are supported by the presence of the Compliance Service, which exercises independent oversight and evaluation in order to assist 
managers in effectively managing regulatory compliance risk and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with regulatory requirements.  
 
Both the Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit and the Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer have a direct 
functional link to the Chair of the Audit Committee and to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee. They both also have direct access to the President and 
Chief Executive Officer. 
 
In accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), OSFI is mandated to protect the rights and interests of the depositors. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into 
the business and affairs of the Bank, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being satisfied and that the Bank is in 
sound financial condition. 
 
The independent auditor, Deloitte LLP, whose report follows, was appointed by the shareholders on the recommendation of the Board. The auditor has full and 
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss audit and financial reporting matters.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
To the Shareholders of National Bank of Canada, 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada (the Bank), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets 
as at October 31, 2018 and 2017 and as at November 1, 2017, the consolidated statements of income, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, 
the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
F9  -  2coul  An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures 
   selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at October 31, 2018 and 2017 
and as at November 1, 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  
National Bank of Canada (the Bank) is a financial institution incorporated and domiciled in Canada and whose shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Its head office is located at 600 De La Gauchetière Street West in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Bank is a chartered bank under Schedule 1 of the Bank Act 
(Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). 
 
The Bank is an integrated financial group that provides comprehensive financial services to consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large 
corporations in its national market while also offering specialized services internationally. It operates four business segments, namely, the Personal and 
Commercial segment, the Wealth Management segment, the Financial Markets segment, and the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. 
Its full line of services include banking and investing solutions for individuals and businesses, corporate banking and investment banking services, securities 
brokerage, insurance and wealth management. 
 
On December 4, 2018, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the publication of the Bank’s audited annual consolidated financial statements 
(the consolidated financial statements) for the year ended October 31, 2018. 
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Bank have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as 
otherwise specified by OSFI, the financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI 
accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
Unless stated otherwise, the accounting policies described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section have been applied consistently to all 
periods presented. On November 1, 2017, the Bank adopted IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (IFRS 9). Subsequent to IFRS 9 application, the Bank changed the 
policies of two key accounting areas, as described in the Accounting Policy Changes section. As permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the Bank has 
elected to not restate the prior period figures, which have been reported using the previous accounting policies. 
 
On November 1, 2017, the Bank changed the presentation of certain items on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassified certain amounts. The former 
Personal and credit card loans item is now presented in two separate items. The Purchased receivables item, which had been presented net of allowances for 
credit losses in an amount of $2,014 million as at October 31, 2017 is now reported in Residential mortgage loans ($1,116 million) and in Personal loans 
($874 million), and the Allowances for credit losses item was reduced by $24 million. As a result of this presentation change, for the year ended 
October 31, 2017, a $204 million amount reported in Non-interest income – Other was reclassified to Interest income – Loans. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency.

Accounting Policy Changes 
 
On January 9, 2015, OSFI issued a final version of Early Adoption of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments for Domestic Systemically Important Banks and stated 
therein that it expected Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), a group that includes the Bank, to early adopt IFRS 9 as of November 1, 2017. As 
permitted by the IASB, the Bank early adopted IFRS 9 on November 1, 2017. IFRS 9 replaces the guidance in IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement (IAS 39). It sets out requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, for the impairment of 
financial assets, and for general hedge accounting. As a result of IFRS 9, consequential amendments were made to IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
requiring additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures that were adopted at the same time as IFRS 9.  
 
As permitted by IFRS 9, the Bank did not restate comparative period financial statements. The Bank applied IFRS 9 on a retrospective basis. Adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of initial application have been accounted for in the opening balances of Retained earnings, 
Accumulated other comprehensive income and Non-controlling interests as at November 1, 2017. Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements presents 
the impacts of IFRS 9 adoption on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2017. 
 
The adoption of IFRS 9 on November 1, 2017 gave rise to accounting policy changes in two key areas: classification and measurement as well as impairment. 
These new policies have been applied since November 1, 2017. As permitted by IFRS 9, the Bank had adopted the own credit risk provisions of IFRS 9 effective 
February 1, 2016. The Bank has elected, as permitted under IFRS 9, to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The accounting policy 
changes arising from IFRS 9 adoption on November 1, 2017 are described hereafter. 
 
Classification and Measurement 
IFRS 9 provides a single model for financial asset classification and measurement that is based on both the business model for managing financial assets and 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss. 
 
The following summarizes the key changes resulting from IFRS 9 adoption: 
  The “held-to-maturity” and “available-for-sale” financial asset categories were removed. 
  A new “measured at amortized cost” financial asset category was introduced. It applies to debt instruments whose contractual cash flow characteristics 
are solely payments of principal and interest and that are held in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows. 
  A new “measured at fair value through other comprehensive income” financial asset category was introduced. It applies to debt instruments whose 
contractual cash flow characteristics are solely payments of principal and interest and that are held in a business model whose objective is achieved both 
by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
  A new financial asset category for non-trading equity investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income was introduced. 
 
The classification and measurement of financial liabilities remain essentially unchanged under IFRS 9, except for financial liabilities designated as measured 
at fair value through profit or loss. Once the fair value election is made, changes in fair value attributable to changes in an entity’s own credit risk must be 
recognized in Other comprehensive income rather than in net income. On February 1, 2016, the Bank early adopted, on a prospective basis, the own credit risk 
provisions of IFRS 9. 
 
Impairment 
IFRS 9 introduces a new, single impairment model for financial assets that requires the recognition of expected credit losses (ECL) rather than the incurred 
credit losses applied under IAS 39. Under IAS 39, impairment losses were recognized if, and only if, there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of 
one or more loss events that had occurred after initial recognition of the asset and that loss event had a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows 
of the asset that could be reliably estimated. If there was no objective evidence of impairment for an individual financial asset, that financial asset was 
included in a group of assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment losses incurred but not yet identified. Under IFRS 
9, ECLs are recognized in profit or loss before a loss event has occurred. 
Under IAS 39, incurred credit losses were measured by incorporating reasonable and supportable information about past events and current conditions. Under 
IFRS 9, the ECL model, which is forward-looking, also requires that forecasts of future events and economic conditions be used when determining significant 
increases in credit risk and when measuring expected losses. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, 
interest rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) are incorporated into the risk parameters. Estimating forward-looking information requires significant 
judgment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 
Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions 
In preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management must exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reporting date carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, net income and related information. Furthermore, certain accounting policies require complex 
judgments and estimates because they apply to matters that are inherently uncertain, in particular accounting policies applicable to the fair value 
determination of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, the impairment of non-financial assets, pension plans and other post-employment 
benefits, income taxes, provisions, consolidation of structured entities and classification of debt instruments under IFRS 9. Descriptions of these judgments 
and estimates are provided in each of the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates, in which 
case the impact is recognized in the consolidated financial statements of future fiscal periods. The accounting policies described in this note provide greater 
detail about the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on judgment. 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements include all of the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries, after elimination of 
intercompany transactions and balances. The subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Bank. A structured entity is an entity 
created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls 
the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. 
 
Management must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank must consolidate an entity. The Bank controls an entity only if the following three 
conditions are met: 
  it has decision-making authority regarding the entity’s relevant activities;  
  it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;  
  it has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the returns. 
 
When determining decision-making authority, many factors are taken into account, including the existence and effect of actual and potential voting rights held 
by the Bank that can be exercised as well as the holding of instruments that are convertible into voting shares. In addition, the Bank must determine whether, 
as an investor with decision-making rights, it acts as a principal or agent.  
 
Based on these principles, an assessment of control is performed at the inception of a relationship between any entity and the Bank. When performing this 
assessment, the Bank considers all facts and circumstances, and it must reassess whether it still controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three conditions of control. 
 
The Bank consolidates the entities it controls from the date on which control is obtained and ceases to consolidate them from the date control ceases. The 
Bank uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from a third party on the date control is obtained.   
 
Non-Controlling Interests 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity interests of third parties in the Bank’s subsidiaries and are presented in total Equity, separately 
from Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. The non-controlling interests’ proportionate share in the net income and other comprehensive income of 
the Bank’s subsidiaries are presented in total net income and total comprehensive income, respectively.  
 
With respect to units issued to third parties by mutual funds and certain other funds that are consolidated, they are presented at fair value in Other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lastly, changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognized as equity 
transactions. The difference between the adjustment in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognized directly in Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. 
 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
The Bank exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. The 
Bank has joint control over an entity when there’s a contractually agreed sharing of control of an entity that exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 
Investments in associates, i.e., entities over which the Bank exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures, i.e., entities over which the Bank 
has rights to the net assets and exercises joint control, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially 
recorded at cost and, following acquisition, the Bank’s shares in the net income and in the other comprehensive income are recognized, respectively, in Non-
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The 
carrying value of the investment is adjusted by an equivalent amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reduced by distributions received.

Foreign Currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the group 
determines its own functional currency, and the items reported in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that currency. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the rates in effect on the date of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Translation gains and losses are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Revenues and 
expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
into the functional currency at historical rates. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated using the 
exchange rates in effect on the date fair value is determined, and the translation gains or losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Under IAS 39, translation gains or losses on non-monetary items classified as available for sale are recognized in Other comprehensive income. Under IFRS 9, 
translation gains or losses on equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are also recognized in Other comprehensive 
income. Under IAS 39, upon disposal or due to impairment of a non-monetary item classified as available for sale, the deferred translation gains or losses are 
reclassified, in whole or in part, from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Non-interest income of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Under 
IFRS 9, deferred translation gains or losses on equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are not reclassified to net 
income. 
 
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional currency using the rates in 
effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, whereas the revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional 
currency at the average exchange rates for the period. Any goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a foreign operation that does not have the same functional

foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income relating to that particular operation is reclassified 
to Non-interest income of the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments for the Year Ended October 31, 2018 
The Bank applied the IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements applicable to financial instruments for the year ended October 31, 2018. The 2017 
comparative period has not been restated, and the IAS 39 requirements have been applied. 
 
At initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be 
classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank 
determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these 
financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
For the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The 
interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, 
and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset 
are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
When classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a 
same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are 
generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios 
that it reasonably expects to occur. The business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the relevant 
evidence available at the date of determination. 
 
A financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect” business model when the Bank’s primary objective is to hold these financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows from them and not to sell them. When the Bank’s objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the 
financial assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect and sell” business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank’s objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are 
mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a “hold to collect” business model or a “hold to collect and sell” 
business model.

A financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if certain conditions are met. The Bank may apply this 
option if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency 
that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases and if the fair values are 
reliable. Financial assets thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. Interest income arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Net interest income 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
A financial liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized.  Financial liabilities thus designated are 
recognized at fair value, and any changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Other comprehensive income 
unless these changes offset the amounts recognized in Net income. Fair value changes not attributable to the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Non-
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income will not be subsequently reclassified to Net 
income. Interest expense arising from these financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in the Net interest income item of the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following cases: 
 
  If, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or 
recognition mismatch of measuring financial assets or liabilities on a different basis, and if the fair values are reliable.

Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
It is permitted to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for trading nor a contingent 
consideration recognized in a business combination as being at fair value through other comprehensive income. In accordance with this designation, any 
change in fair value is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification to net income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest 
income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include: (i) debt securities for which the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
 
rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a “hold to 
collect and sell” business model and (ii) equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of 
gains and losses to net income. 
 
The Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through other comprehensive income on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. 
Interest income and dividend income are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Debt Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Debt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of 
expected credit losses and income taxes, and provided that they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in 
Other comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest 
income – Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are 
amortized over the expected life of the instrument to interest income using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Equity Securities Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are presented, net of 
income taxes, in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of realized gains and losses to net income. Transaction costs incurred upon 
the purchase of such equity securities are not reclassified to net income upon the sale of the securities.

Securities Measured at Amortized Cost 
Securities measured at amortized cost include debt securities for which the contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a “hold to collect” business model. 
 
The Bank recognizes these securities transactions at fair value on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. After initial recognition, debt 
securities in this category are recorded at amortized cost. Interest income is recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the instrument to interest income using the effective interest rate 
method. Securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Securities not classified or designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or at amortized cost are classified as measured at fair 
value through profit or loss. 
 
Securities measured at fair value through profit or loss include (i) securities held for trading, (ii) securities designated at fair value through profit or loss, (iii) all 
equity securities other than those designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassifications of gains 
and losses to net income, and (iv) debt securities for which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and any interest on the principal 
amount outstanding. 
 
The Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through profit or loss on the settlement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value

income on securities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Realized and 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities are recognized in Non-interest income – Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Realized and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities at fair value through profit or loss, other than those held for trading, as well as debt securities for 
which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are recognized in Non-interest income 
– Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The dividend and interest income on these financial assets are 
recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Obligations Related to Securities Sold  
Under Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned  
The Bank recognizes these transactions at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, except when they are designated at fair value through profit 
or loss and are recorded at fair value. These transactions are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Securities sold under repurchase agreements remain on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions. 
 
The Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part 
of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral pledged or received in 
the form of cash is recognized in financial assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the collateral is pledged or received in the form of cash, the interest income and expense are recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.  
 
Loans 
Loans Measured at Amortized Cost 
Loans classified as measured at amortized cost include loans originated or purchased by the Bank that are not classified as measured at fair value through 
profit or loss or designated at fair value through profit or loss. These loans are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash 
flows, i.e., cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All loans originated by the Bank are recognized 
when cash is advanced to a borrower. Purchased loans are recognized when cash consideration is paid by the Bank.

All loans are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable costs and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate 
method, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. For purchased performing loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan is amortized 
to interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. For purchased credit-impaired loans, the acquisition 
date fair value adjustment on each loan consists of management’s estimate of the shortfall of principal and interest cash flows that the Bank expects to collect 
and of the time value of money. The time value of money component of the fair value adjustment is amortized to interest income over the remaining life of the 
loan using the effective interest rate method. Loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Loans Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Loans classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, loans designated at fair value through profit or loss, and loans for which the contractual cash 
flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The interest income on loans at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Changes in the fair value of loans classified as at fair value through profit or loss and loans designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in 
Non-interest income – Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. With respect to loans whose contractual cash flows are not solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income – Other in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments for the Year Ended October 31, 2017 
The Bank applied the IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements applicable to financial instruments for the year ended October 31, 2018. The 2017 
comparative period has not been restated, and the IAS 39 requirements have been applied. 
 
In accordance with the accounting framework for financial instruments, all financial assets and liabilities must be classified based on their characteristics, 
management’s intention, or choice of category in certain circumstances. When initially recognized, all financial assets are classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss, held to maturity, available for sale, or loans and receivables, while financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss or as 
financial liabilities at amortized cost. Certain debt securities that are not quoted in an active market may be classified as loans and receivables, and 
impairment is determined using the same model as for loans. Loans and receivables that the Bank intends to sell immediately or in the near term must be 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss, whereas loans and receivables for which the Bank may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, for 
reasons other than credit deterioration, must be classified as available for sale. 
 
When initially recognized, all financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In subsequent periods, they are 
measured at fair value, except for items classified in the following categories, which are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method: 
financial assets held to maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities at amortized cost. 
 
Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
A financial asset or liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized. Financial assets thus designated 
are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Financial liabilities thus 
designated are recognized at fair value, and any changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Other 
comprehensive income unless these changes offset the amounts recognized in Net income. Fair value changes not attributable to the Bank's own credit risk 
are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income will not be 
subsequently reclassified to Net income. Interest income and expenses arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss 
are recorded in the Net interest income item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following cases. 
 
  If, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or 
recognition mismatch of measuring financial assets or liabilities on a different basis, and if the fair values are reliable. 
  If a group of financial assets and financial liabilities to which an instrument belongs is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Bank’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information is provided on that basis to senior management.  9
Consequently, the Bank may use this option if it has implemented a documented risk management strategy to manage a group of financial instruments 
together on the fair value basis, if it can demonstrate that significant financial risks are eliminated or significantly reduced, and if the fair values are 
reliable. 
  For hybrid financial instruments with one or more embedded derivatives that would significantly modify the cash flows of the financial instruments and 
C_rapport   that would otherwise be bifurcated and accounted for separately.

Securities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Securities at fair value through profit or loss are generally purchased for sale in the near term or are part of portfolios of identified financial instruments that 
are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. The Bank accounts for securities transactions at fair 
value through profit or loss on the settlement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value between the trade date and the settlement date 
are included in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value, and transaction fees are recognized directly in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Interest income as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Available-for-Sale Securities 
Securities that are neither classified as at fair value through profit or loss nor as held to maturity nor in the loans and receivables category are classified as 
available-for-sale securities. The Bank accounts for available-for-sale securities transactions on the trade date, and the related transaction costs are 
capitalized.  
 
Available-for-sale securities are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of impairment losses and income taxes, provided 
they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in Other comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, the 
realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income on the 
transaction date.

Held-to-Maturity Securities 
Held-to-maturity securities are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity that the Bank intends and is able to hold until 
maturity. The Bank accounts for held-to-maturity securities transactions on the trade date, and the related transaction costs are capitalized. These securities 
are initially recognized at fair value. In subsequent periods, they are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment 
loss measured using the same impairment model used for loans. Interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts on these securities are 
recognized in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Obligations Related to Securities Sold  
Under Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned  
The Bank recognizes these transactions at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, except when they are designated at fair value through profit 
or loss and are recorded at fair value. Securities sold under repurchase agreements remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased 
under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending 
and borrowing transactions. 
 
The Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part 
of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral pledged or received in 
the form of cash is recognized in financial assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the collateral is pledged or received in the form of cash, the interest income and expense are recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. 
 
Loans 
Loans, including transaction costs directly attributable to the granting of the loans, other than loans classified or designated as measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Loans classified or designated as 
measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value.

1 Purchased Receivables 
On the acquisition date, purchased receivables are measured at fair value, which incorporates incurred and expected credit losses estimated on the 
acquisition date and the interest rate differential between the contractual interest rate of the receivable and the current market rates for the remaining term. As 
a result, no allowances for credit losses are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on the acquisition date. Discounts related to incurred credit losses are 
not amortized.  
 
Purchased performing receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on their contractual cash flows, and any discount or premium is

When receivables are acquired with objective evidence of incurred credit loss, where the timely collection of contractual principal and interest is not 
reasonably assured, these receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted 
at the initial effective interest rate. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank re-evaluates the expected future cash flows and adjusts the carrying amount 
of the receivables to reflect the revised expected future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate. This adjustment is immediately recorded in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Reclassification of Financial Instruments 
A financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument or a financial asset that, upon initial recognition, was designated as measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in rare circumstances if the financial asset is no longer held for 
the purpose of selling it in the near term. The financial asset must be reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification, and this fair value becomes its 
new amortized cost, as applicable. No gain or loss previously recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income may be reversed. 
 
Establishing Fair Value 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price).   
  
  F10  -  2coul Uva atn ltauhdeej. u mAs etfeiandsa uqnruceoimatlee idnn tsp dtrriauctemes.e  Ainnnt   aiascc tctiivovene s mmidaaerrkrkeeedtts  qi,s ub ooantseeed dw  iohnne a rbnei  datrc aptnirvisceae cmst iafoornkr sef iton wcacnhucerin aw lp iatrhisc sseeustf sifn iac einexdnc toh ffarfenerqgeued,e  ndpceriyac leaesnr ,df ob vrro oflikunemarn eoc rti aopl p rliirnaocbviiipldiateli- eqtsou,- opptrreiondvc ipidpreiac lte hmse ao brnke aesntts  eo avnridgeoe anincccgee  bsoasf sifbiaslie.r    
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The 
estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value. 
 
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or 
paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique 
based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is 
deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized 
balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks 
associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash 
receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.  
 
In certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair 
value but that are not included in the measurement technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or risk related to the 
valuation model, and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments 
when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an 
insufficient volume of transactions in a given market.  
 
As permitted when certain criteria are met, the Bank has elected to determine fair value based on net exposure to credit risk or market risk for certain portfolios 
of financial instruments, mainly derivatives. 
 
Impairment of Financial Assets for the Year Ended October 31, 2018 
At the end of each reporting period, the Bank applies a three-stage impairment approach to measure the expected credit losses (ECL) on all debt instruments 
measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and on loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at 
fair value. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, 
current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions.

Determining the Stage 
The ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the 
credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, 
and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is 
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit 
losses that is measured, at each reporting date, at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit 
risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires 
reverting to Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of a financial asset have occurred, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses 
equal to lifetime expected losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. The interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount 
for financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3. 
 
Assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk 
In determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking 
information to assess deterioration in credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased 
significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected 
life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All 
financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has 
  F10  -  2coul o Mcecausrurerdem. Tehnet  aosf sEexspsemcteendt  Corf ead siti gLnoisfisceasn t increase in credit risk requires significant judgment. 
ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and 
reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The 
estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. The cash shortfall is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
owed to the Bank and all the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.  
 
The measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument’s PD, loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Forward-
looking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and GDP are incorporated into the risk parameters. The 
estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The 
Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario and a downside 
scenario. Probability weights are attributed to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and are subject to management 
review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and 
information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process. 
 
ECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and 
a corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. Allowances for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are not measured at fair value are included in Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired Financial Assets 
On initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank determines whether the asset is credit-impaired. For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon 
purchase or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the 
cumulative changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for 
credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial 
recognition. 
 
Definition of Default 
The definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used 
for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more 
events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a 
settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due.

A financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be 
non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances 
owing are not likely to be recovered.  
Impairment of Financial Assets for the Year Ended October 31, 2017 
At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset or group of financial assets. 
There is objective evidence of impairment when one or more loss events occur after the initial recognition of the asset and prior to or on the balance sheet date 
and these events adversely affect the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets in question. Management must exercise judgment to determine 
whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment and to estimate the timing of future cash flows. 
Available-for-Sale Securities 
Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at the end of each reporting period. The Bank considers all available objective 
evidence of impairment, including observable data about loss events such as: a significant financial difficulty of the issuer, a breach of contract such as a 
default, and situations involving bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. In addition to these loss events, objective evidence of impairment for an equity 
security also includes information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic, or legal

interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This amount is determined as the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any capital 
repayments and amortization) and the current fair value of the asset less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. 
Once an impairment loss has been recognized for an available-for-sale security, the subsequent accounting treatment differs depending on whether the 
instrument is a debt or equity security. 
−  For an available-for-sale debt security, a subsequent decrease in fair value is accounted for in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income when there is further objective evidence of impairment as a result of further decreases in the estimated future cash flows of the debt security. 
Impairment losses recognized in income related to an available-for-sale debt security must be reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Income when, in 
a subsequent period, the fair value of the security increases and the increase can be objectively associated with an event occurring after the loss was 
recognized. 
−  For an available-for-sale equity security, subsequent decreases in fair value are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Recognized 
impairment losses are not reversed through the Consolidated Statement of Income. All subsequent increases in fair value are accounted for in Other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Impaired Loans 
A loan, except credit card receivables, is considered impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment and, in management’s best estimate, the timely 
collection of principal and interest is no longer reasonably assured, or when a payment is contractually 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully secured and 
collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt within 180 days. For credit card receivables, they are written off when payment is 
180 days in arrears. Loans that are insured or fully guaranteed by a Canadian government (federal or provincial) or by a Canadian government agency are 
considered impaired when more than 365 days in arrears. 
When a counterparty to a loan fails to make the payment when contractually due, that loan is considered past due but not impaired. 
When a loan is deemed impaired, interest recognition ceases and the carrying amount of the loan is reduced to its estimated realizable amount by writing off 
all or part of the loan or by taking an allowance for credit losses. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the present value of expected future cash 
flows, discounted at the initial effective interest rate of the loan, to its current carrying amount including accrued interest. The losses are recorded in Provisions 
0 for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Situations where a retail, commercial or government borrower begin showing clear signs of potential insolvency are managed on a case-by-case basis and 
require the use of judgment. In these situations, the Bank may grant a concession to the borrower regarding the original terms and conditions of the loan, for 
example by reducing the rate, granting a forgiveness of principal or extending the term despite the Bank’s credit policies. Once the terms of the loan have been 
renegotiated and agreed upon with the borrower, the loan is considered a restructured loan. As of the restructuring date, the current carrying amount of the 
loan, including accrued interest, is reduced to the present value of expected cash flows under the modified terms, discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the loan. The reduction in the carrying value is recorded in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Allowances for Credit Losses 
Allowances for credit losses are management’s best estimate of losses in its credit portfolio as at the balance sheet date. They relate primarily to loans but may 
also cover the credit risk associated with deposits with financial institutions, loan substitute securities, credit instruments such as acceptances, and off-
balance-sheet items such as commitments to extend credit, letters of guarantee and letters of credit.  
 
Changes in allowances for credit losses attributable to the passage of time are recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income, whereas 
changes attributable to a revision of expected payments are recorded in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the allowances 
were recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed directly in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
The allowances for credit losses on impaired loans are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and assessed either individually or collectively based on the 
portfolio’s historical net loss experience. The allowance for credit losses on non-impaired loans is assessed collectively. 
 
Allowances on Impaired Loans 
Impairment allowances are recorded for all individually identified impaired loans to reduce their carrying amount to the estimated realizable amount. For each 
impaired loan, the Bank records an individual allowance, when the credit loss assessment is based on a detailed analysis of the borrower’s file, or a collective 
allowance, when the credit loss assessment is based on the portfolio’s historical net loss experience. 
 
For all individually significant impaired loans, namely business and government loans, and for certain impaired loans that are not individually significant, 
namely residential mortgages, the Bank records an individual allowance since the credit loss assessment is based on a detailed analysis of the borrower’s file. 
For all other impaired loans that are not individually significant but have been individually identified as impaired, the Bank records for each such loan a 
collective allowance based on historical net loss experience. 
 
Allowances on Non-Impaired Loans 
When the credit risk of a portfolio of loans that have similar credit risk characteristics increases significantly, such as a group of loans of a specific industry, 
but the loans have yet to be individually identified as impaired, a sectoral allowance is established collectively for the entire loan portfolio. The sectoral 
allowance is determined using an approach similar to the collective allowance measurement on non-impaired loans, i.e., an approach based on expected 
default and loss factors determined by statistical analysis of historical loss data by loan type, and on an analysis of the industry-specific market factors such 
as market liquidity, credit spreads, and risk factor levels. 
 
All loans that have not been individually identified as impaired, and that are not covered by a sectoral allowance, are grouped according to their credit risk 
characteristics for the purpose of calculating a collective allowance on non-impaired loans. The collective allowance on non-impaired loans includes two 
components for credit risk: the allocated collective allowance and the unallocated collective allowance. 
 
The allocated collective allowance for the business and government loan portfolio is based on expected default and loss factors determined by statistical 
analysis of historical loss data, delineated by loan type, to which is added an amount that takes into account the discovery period and migration risk. For 
personal loans, the allocated collective allowance is calculated based on specific parameters by product, and no discovery period is calculated. Losses are 
determined by the application of loss ratios established through statistical analysis of historical loss data.  
 
The unallocated collective allowance reflects management’s assessment of probable portfolio losses that have not been captured by the allocated collective 
allowance. This assessment takes into account general economic and business conditions, recent credit loss data, and credit quality and concentration trends 
when the collective allowance is determined at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This allowance also reflects model and estimation risks. The unallocated 
collective allowance does not represent future losses or serve as a substitute for the allocated collective allowance. 
 
The sectoral allowance and collective allowance on non-impaired loans are collectively established and reflect the impairment losses that the Bank has 
incurred as a result of events that have occurred but where the individual loss has not been identified.

Purchased Receivables 
On the acquisition date, purchased receivables are measured at fair value, which incorporates incurred and expected credit losses estimated on the 
acquisition date and the interest rate differential between the receivable’s contractual interest rate and the current market rates for the remaining term. As a 
result, no allowances for credit losses are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on the acquisition date. Discounts related to incurred credit losses are 
not amortized.  
 
Purchased performing receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on their contractual cash flows, and any discount or premium is 
considered an adjustment to the loan yield and is amortized over the expected life of the receivable using the effective interest rate method and recorded in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
When receivables are acquired with objective evidence of incurred credit loss, where the timely collection of contractual principal and interest is not 
reasonably assured, these receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted 
at the initial effective interest rate. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank re-evaluates the expected future cash flows and adjusts the carrying amount 
of the receivables to reflect the revised expected future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate. This adjustment is immediately recorded in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Derecognition of Financial Assets and Securitization 
A financial asset is considered for derecognition when the Bank has transferred contractual rights to receive the cash flows or assumed an obligation to 
transfer these cash flows to a third party. The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when it considers that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset have been transferred or when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset expire. When the Bank considers that it has retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset and, if applicable, recognizes a 
financial liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If, due to a derivative financial instrument, the transfer of a financial asset does not result in 
derecognition, the derivative financial instrument is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial 
asset it no longer controls. Any rights and obligations retained following the asset transfer are recognized separately as an asset or liability. If the Bank retains 
control of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset, i.e., to the extent to which it is 
exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset. 
 
In order to diversify its funding sources, the Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the 
Mortgage-Backed Securities Program under the National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. Under the first program, the 
Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgages and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT). As 
part of these transactions, the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards related to ownership of the mortgage loans sold. Therefore, the insured 
mortgage loans securitized under the CMB program continue to be recognized in the Loans item on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and the liabilities 
for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Moreover, 
insured mortgage loans securitized and retained by the Bank continue to be recognized in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability 
transferred and the consideration paid is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Cash and Deposits With Financial Institutions  
Cash and deposits with financial institutions consist of cash and cash equivalents, amounts pledged as collateral as well as amounts placed in escrow. Cash 
comprises cash and bank notes. Cash equivalents consist of deposits with the Bank of Canada, deposits with financial institutions, including net receivables 
related to cheques and other items in the clearing process as well as the net amount of cheques and other items in transit. 
 
Acceptances and Customers’ Liability Under Acceptances  
The potential liability of the Bank under acceptances is recorded as a customer commitment liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank’s potential 
recourse vis à vis clients is recorded as an equivalent offsetting asset. Fees are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short 
This financial liability represents the Bank’s obligation to deliver the securities it sold but did not own at the time of sale. Obligations related to securities sold 
short are recorded at fair value and presented as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in 
Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments  
In the normal course of business, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments to meet the needs of its clients, to generate trading activity revenues, and to 
manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and other market risks.

All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are 
included in assets, and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value are included in liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where there are 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative financial instruments is reported either as an asset or as a liability. 
 
Embedded Derivative Financial Instruments 
An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host contract, which causes some of the cash flows of the 
combined instrument to vary in a way similar to a standalone derivative. The embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be 
required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of 
prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided that, in the case of a non-financial variable, the variable is not specific to one of the 
parties to the contract.  
 
Embedded derivatives are bifurcated and accounted for separately if, and only if, the following three conditions are met: the economic characteristics and risks 
of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, the embedded derivative is a separate instrument that meets the definition of 
a derivative, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. For the year ended October 31, 2018, these conditions continue to 
apply to hybrid contracts that contain a host contract that is not a financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9. Where a hybrid contract contains a host contract 
that is a financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9, the entire hybrid contract, including all embedded features, is measured for classification under IFRS 9. 
 
Embedded derivatives that must be bifurcated and separately accounted for are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and 
unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In general, all embedded derivatives are 
presented on a combined basis with the host contract. However, certain embedded derivatives that are bifurcated from the host contract are presented in 
Derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Held-for-Trading Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses (including interest income and expense) are 
recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Policy 
As permitted by IFRS 9, the Bank elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39, which are described hereafter. 
 
The purpose of a hedging transaction is to modify the Bank’s exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the 
cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting ensures that offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period or periods. 
 
Documenting and Assessing Effectiveness 
The Bank designates and formally documents each hedging relationship, at its inception, by detailing the risk management objective and the hedging strategy. 
The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability or cash flows being hedged, the related hedging instrument, the nature of the specific risk exposure or 
exposures being hedged, the intended term of the hedging relationship and the method for assessing the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the hedging 
relationship. At the inception of the hedging relationship, and for every financial reporting period for which the hedge has been designated, the Bank ensures 
that the hedging relationship is highly effective and consistent with its originally documented risk management objective and strategy. When a hedging 
relationship meets the hedge accounting requirements, it is designated as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a foreign exchange hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation. 
 
Fair Value Hedges 
For fair value hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of a hedged item. The carrying amount of the hedged item is 
adjusted based on the effective portion of the gains or losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, 
as well as the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The resulting ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.  
 
The Bank prospectively discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting or if the Bank revokes the designation. When the designation is revoked, the hedged item is no longer adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, and 
the amounts previously recorded as cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are 
amortized using the effective interest rate method and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. If 
the hedged item is sold or terminated before maturity, the cumulative adjustments to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk 
are immediately recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Cash Flow Hedges 
For cash flow hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge variable cash flows attributable to the hedged risk related to a 
financial asset or liability (or to a group of financial assets or liabilities). The effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized 
in Other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
The amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income of the period or 
periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the 
hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank cancels that designation, then the amounts previously recognized in Accumulated 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item 
affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations  
Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge foreign exchange risk related to investments made in foreign operations whose 
functional currency is not the Canadian dollar. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive 
income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon the total or partial sale of a net investment in a 
foreign operation, amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified, in whole or in part, to Non-interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
 
Premises and Equipment 
Premises and equipment, except for land, are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Land is recorded at cost 
net of any impairment losses. 
 
Premises and equipment and the significant components of a building that have different useful lives or that provide economic benefits at a different pace are 
systematically amortized over their useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis. The amortization expense is recorded 
in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Leasehold improvements    Straight-line   (1)  
 
(1)  The average amortization period is 15 years, determined using the lesser of the useful life or the lease term plus the first renewal option. 
 
Goodwill  
The Bank uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the 
acquisition-date fair value and the transaction costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Bank acquires control of a business, all of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, including intangible assets, are recorded at fair value. The interests previously held in the acquiree are 
also measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration and all previously held interests over the fair value of identifiable 
net assets of the acquiree. If the fair value of identifiable net assets exceeds the purchase consideration and all previously held interests, the difference is 
immediately recognized as a gain on a bargain purchase. 
 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Bank’s ownership interest and can be initially 
measured at either fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The measurement basis is 
selected on a case-by-case basis. Following the acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the value assigned to those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.

Intangible Assets 
Intangible Assets With Finite Useful Lives  
Software and certain other intangible assets are recognized at cost net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible 
assets are systematically amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which vary between four and ten years. The amortization expense is 
recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Intangible Assets With Indefinite Useful Lives 
The Bank’s intangible assets with indefinite useful lives come from the acquisition of subsidiaries or groups of assets and consist of management contracts 
and a trademark. They are recognized at the acquisition-date fair value. The management contracts are for the management of open-ended funds. At the end of 
each reporting period, the Bank reviews the useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
assessment. Intangible assets are deemed to have an indefinite useful life following an examination of all relevant factors, in particular: a) the contracts do not 
have contractual maturities; b) the stability of the business segment to which the intangible assets belong; c) the Bank’s capacity to control the future 
economic benefits of the intangible assets; and d) the continued economic benefits generated by the intangible assets. 
 
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
Premises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or 
intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use or that have indefinite useful lives 
are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.  
 
An asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual 
asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs will be determined. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs. 
 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of 
expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such 
as projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a 
significant impact on income. 
 
Corporate assets, such as the head office building and computer equipment, do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. Therefore, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management has 
decided to dispose of the asset. However, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU or 
group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of this CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or group of CGUs. For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting 
from a business combination must be allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each CGU or 
group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must represent the lowest level for which the goodwill is monitored internally at the Bank and must not be larger 
than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU or group of CGUs involves management’s judgment. If an impairment loss is to be recognized, 
the Bank does so by first reducing the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs and then reducing the carrying amounts of the other 
assets of the CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment 
loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than 
goodwill must be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment 
was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased, as the impairment loss was reversed, but shall not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for this asset in previous years. 
 
Leases 
A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in return for a payment or series of 
payments. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. Title may or 
may not eventually be transferred. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. The Bank primarily enters into operating leases. 
 
When the Bank is the lessee under an operating lease, the rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in Non-interest expenses in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income. When the Bank is the lessor, the lease assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported in premises 
and equipment, and the rental income is recognized net of related expenses in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Provisions 
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a 
past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant 
risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money. The provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. 
Provisions are presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
The Bank’s revenues are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as they are earned. 
 
Interest Income and Expense 
Interest income and expense, except for the interest income on securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in Net interest income 
and calculated using the effective interest rate method.  
 
Under IFRS 9, the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through the expected life of the financial 
asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest 
rate, the Bank estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit 
losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a 
financial asset except for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets and financial assets that were not impaired upon their purchase or 
origination but became impaired thereafter. For the purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Bank applies the credit-adjusted effective 
interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The credit-adjusted effective interest rate reflects expected credit losses. As for 
loans that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount (net of 
allowances for credit losses) rather than to the carrying amount. 
 
Under IAS 39, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through the expected life of the financial 
instrument (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) to the net carrying amount of the instrument. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank 
estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but without considering future credit losses and also includes all fees paid or 
received related to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. 
 
Commission Revenues 
Loan origination fees, including commitment, restructuring and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan. They are 
deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Direct costs for 
originating a loan are netted against the loan origination fees. If it is likely that a commitment will result in a loan, commitment fees receive the same 
accounting treatment, i.e., they are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over 
the term of the loan. Otherwise, they are recorded in Non-interest income over the term of the commitment.  
 
Loan syndication fees are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders 
involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the 
amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Certain mortgage loan prepayment fees are recognized in Interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income when earned. 
 
Dividend Income 
Dividends from an equity instrument are recognized in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the Bank’s right to receive payment 
is established. 
 
Insurance Revenues 
Insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, are arrangements under which one party accepts significant insurance risk by agreeing to compensate 
the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event were to occur. Gross premiums, net of premiums transferred under reinsurance contracts, are recognized 
when they become due. Royalties received from reinsurers are recognized when earned. Claims are recognized when received and an amount is estimated as 
they are being processed. All of these amounts are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income  in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Upon recognition of a premium, a reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized, respectively, in Other assets and in Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of the reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized on a net basis in 
Non-interest income  in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Income Taxes 
Income taxes include current taxes and deferred taxes and are recorded in net income except for income taxes generated by items recognized in Other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
 
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable income for a period. It is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates 
prevailing on the reporting date, and any adjustments recognized in the period for current tax of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset and 
the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability. 
 
Deferred tax is established based on temporary differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, in accordance with enacted 
or substantively enacted income tax laws and rates that will apply on the date the differences will reverse. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary 
differences related to the following: 
  
  the initial accounting of goodwill; 
  the initial accounting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting income nor taxable income;   
  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; 
  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that there will not be taxable income to which the temporary difference can be recognized.  
 
Deferred tax assets are tax benefits in the form of deductions the Bank may claim to reduce its taxable income in future years. At the end of each reporting 
period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is revised and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be 
available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when 
the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets and liabilities, and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities that intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities based on their net 
amount. 
 
The Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process includes estimating the actual amount of 
current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of the items reported for accounting 
and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are calculated according to the tax rates to be 
applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current 
information.  
 
Moreover, the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of various tax authorities. In the normal course of its business, the Bank is involved in a number of 
transactions for which the tax impacts are uncertain. As a result, the Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the tax 
risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. The amounts of these 
provisions reflect the best possible estimates of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. The provisions 
are estimated at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that an adjustment to the provision needs to be recognized at a future date following 
an audit by the tax authorities. When the final assessment differs from the initially provisioned amounts, the difference will impact the income taxes of the 
period in which the assessment was made.  
 
Financial Guarantee Contracts 
A financial guarantee contract is a contract or indemnification agreement that could require the Bank to make specified payments (in cash, financial 
instruments, other assets, Bank shares, or provisions of services) to reimburse the beneficiary in the event of a loss resulting from a debtor defaulting on the 
original or amended terms of a debt instrument. 
 
To reflect the fair value of the obligation assumed at the inception of a financial guarantee, a liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. After initial recognition, under IFRS 9, the Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the allowance for credit losses 
determined using the ECL model and of the initially recognized amount less, where applicable, the cumulative amount of income recognized. Under IAS 39, the 
Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the amount needed to settle the financial obligation under the guarantee and the amount 
initially recognized less, where applicable, the cumulative amount of income recognized. This revenue is recognized in Credit fees in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.  
 
Employee Benefits – Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The other post-employment benefit plans 
include post-employment medical, dental and life insurance coverage. While pension plans are funded, the other plans are not.

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 
 
Plan expenses and obligations are actuarially determined based on the projected benefit method prorated on service. The calculations use management’s best 
estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and retirement 
age.  
 
The net asset or net liability of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the 
present value of the future benefits earned by employees in respect of current- and prior-period service and the fair value of plan assets. The net asset or net 
liability is included in either the Other assets or Other liabilities item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 
The expense related to pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans consists of the following items: current service cost, net interest on the net 
plan asset or liability, administration costs and past service cost, if any, recognized when a plan is amended. This expense is recognized in Compensation and 
employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The net amount of interest income and expense is determined by applying a discount rate to the 
net plan asset or liability amount. 
 
Remeasurements resulting from pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans represent actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit 
obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net asset or liability of the plans. 
Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income; these cumulative gains 
and losses are reclassified to Retained earnings. 
 
Share-Based Payments 
The Bank has several share-based compensation plans: the Stock Option Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan, the Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plan, 
the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan, the Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of National Bank Financial and the 
Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
 
Compensation expense is recognized over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the award. This period is generally the same as 
the vesting period, except where the required service period begins before the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees 
eligible to retire on the award date is immediately recognized on the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees who will 
become eligible to retire during the vesting period is recognized over the period from the award date to the date the employee becomes eligible to retire. For all 
of these plans, as of the first year of recognition, the expense includes cancellation and forfeiture estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as 
necessary. The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with some of these plans. The compensation expense for these plans, 
net of related hedges, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Under the Stock Option Plan, the Bank uses the fair value method to account for stock options awarded. The options vest at 25% per year, and each tranche is 
treated as though it was a separate award. The fair value of each of the tranches is measured on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and this fair 
value is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits and Contributed surplus. When the options are exercised, the Contributed surplus amount is 
credited to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds received from the employees when these options are exercised are also 
credited to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
SARs are recorded at fair value when awarded and their fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until they are exercised. The cost is 
recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 
obligation that results from the change in fair value at each period is recognized in net income gradually over the vesting period, and periodically thereafter, 
until the SARs are exercised.  When a SAR is exercised, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the increase in the stock price since the date of the award. 
 
The obligation that results from the award of a DSU, RSU, PSU and DCP unit is recognized in net income, and the corresponding amount is included in Other 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the DSU, RSU and DCP plans, the change in the obligation attributable to variations in the share price and 
dividends paid on common shares for these plans is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the 
period in which the variations occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date. For the 
PSU Plan, the change in the obligation attributable to changes in the stock price, adjusted upward or downward depending on the relative result of the 
performance criteria, and the change in the obligation attributable to dividends paid on the shares awarded under the plan, are recognized in Compensation 
and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period in which the changes occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash 
payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date, adjusted upward or downward according to the performance criteria. This is based on the total 
shareholder return (TSR) achieved by the Bank compared to that of the S&P/TSX Banks adjusted sub-index. 
 
The Bank’s contributions to the employee share ownership plan are expensed as incurred.

Note 2 – Future Accounting Policy Changes 
  
The IASB issues revisions and amendments to a number of standards, some of which have already had an impact on the Bank and others that could have an 
impact in the future. The Bank is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the following standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. A 
summary of these amendments and the effective dates applicable to the Bank are presented below.  
  
Effective Date – November 1, 2018 
IFRS 15 – Revenue From Contracts With Customers 
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15, which replaces the current revenue recognition standards and interpretations. In July 2015, the IASB unanimously 
confirmed its proposal to defer the IFRS 15 effective date to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which is November 1, 2018 for the Bank. In April 
2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 15, providing clarifications on, among other topics, the elements to be considered when determining whether an 
entity is a principal or agent. 
 
IFRS 15 provides a single comprehensive model to use when accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. The new model applies to all contracts with 
customers except those that fall within the scope of other IFRS standards such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. As a result, the 
majority of the Bank’s revenues, including net interest income, will not be affected. According to the core principle of IFRS 15, the method used to recognize 
revenue from contracts with customers should reflect the moment when the promised goods or services are transferred and reflect the amount of consideration 
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Consequently, the entity recognizes revenue for a performance obligation as it is 
F10  -  2coul s Traatinssfiiteido,n t Ihmapt aisc,t w  hen control of the goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.  
   For the Bank, the transition to IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on when revenue from contracts with customers is recognized. However, the 
presentation of certain revenues and certain non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income will change, as gross amounts will have to be 
presented. At this time, certain revenues are presented net of certain non-interest expenses. This presentation change will not have a significant impact on the 
Bank. Upon transition, IFRS 15 permits entities to either restate prior periods or to apply the standard on a modified retrospective basis. The Bank has chosen 
to apply the standard using the modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the 
opening balance of Retained earnings as at November 1, 2018, without restating comparative periods. This adjustment to the opening balance of Retained 
earnings as at November 1, 2018 will not be significant.  
  
Effective Date – November 1, 2019 
IFRS 16 – Leases 
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet using a single model, 
thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessor accounting, however, remains similar to current accounting practice, and the 
distinction between operating and finance leases is retained. Early application is permitted if IFRS 15 – Revenue From Contracts With Customers is also 
applied. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments 
In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23, which addresses how to reflect tax treatment uncertainty in accounting for income taxes.  
 
Effective Date – November 1, 2020 
On March 29, 2018, the IASB issued the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to replace its 2010 conceptual framework. For the IASB, the 
revised conceptual framework has been in effect since its publication date. Early application is permitted. 
 
Effective Date – November 1, 2021 
IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, a new standard that replaces IFRS 4, the current insurance contract accounting standard. IFRS 17 
introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. At its meeting on November 14, 2018, the 
IASB tentatively decided to defer the IFRS 17 effective date to fiscal years beginning on or after January, 1, 2022.

1 Note 3 – Impacts of IFRS 9 Adoption 
  
The IFRS 9 classification and measurement requirements as well as the impairment requirements have been applied retrospectively through adjustments to 
Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts on the date of initial application, i.e., November 1, 2017, with no restatement of comparative periods. The impacts of 
IFRS 9 adoption were recognized through adjustments to Retained earnings, Accumulated other comprehensive income, and Non-controlling interests on 
November 1, 2017.

(a)  As at October 31, 2017, these equity securities were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option. On November 1, 2017, these equity securities were classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss since, under IFRS 9, all investments in equity instruments, other than those designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains 
and losses to net income, must be classified as at fair value through profit or loss. 
(b)  As at October 31, 2017, these debt securities were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option. On November 1, 2017, as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the 
Bank decided to revoke this designation and classified these securities as at fair value through other comprehensive income since (1) the financial assets are held within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and (2) the contractual terms of these debt securities give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
(c)  As at October 31, 2017, these debt securities were classified as available for sale. They were being recognized at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Other comprehensive income. On 
November 1, 2017, under IFRS 9, the Bank reclassified these debt securities as at amortized cost, since (1) the financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting 
contractual cash flows and (2) the contractual terms of these debt securities give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
(d)  As at October 31, 2017, these debt securities were classified as available for sale. They were being recognized at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Other comprehensive income. On 
November 1, 2017, and as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the Bank made an irrevocable election to designate these debt securities at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value 
option.  
(e)  As at October 31, 2017, these equity securities were classified as available for sale. They were being recognized at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Other comprehensive income. On 
November 1, 2017, and as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the Bank made an irrevocable election to designate these equity securities held in non-trading portfolios at fair value through 
other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains and losses to net income.  
(f)  As at October 31, 2017, these equity securities were classified as available for sale. They were being recognized at fair value with changes in fair value being recorded in Other comprehensive income. On 
November 1, 2017, these equity securities were classified as at fair value through profit or loss, since, under IFRS 9, all investments in equity instruments, other than those designated at fair value through 
other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains and losses to net income, must be classified as at fair value through profit or loss. 
(g)  As at October 31, 2017, these debt securities were classified as held to maturity and accounted for at amortized cost. On November 1, 2017, and as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the Bank 
made an irrevocable election to designate certain debt securities at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.  
(h)  As at October 31, 2017, these loans were classified as loans and receivables and accounted for at amortized cost. On November 1, 2017, under IFRS 9, these loans had to be classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss, since the contractual terms of these financial assets give rise to cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
(i)  As at October 31, 2017, these loans were designated at fair value through profit or loss, since IAS 39 had allowed for the full amount of a hybrid financial instrument containing one or more embedded 
derivatives that would be bifurcated and accounted for separately to be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option. On November 1, 2017, the Bank revoked this 
designation. Under IFRS 9, the full amount of such hybrid financial instruments is classified as at fair value through profit or loss, since the contractual terms of these financial assets give rise to cash flows 
that are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
(j)  As at October 31, 2017, these financial liabilities were accounted for at amortized cost. On November 1, 2017, and as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions, the Bank made an irrevocable election 
to designate certain deposits and certain liabilities related to transferred receivables at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.

Note 3 – Impacts of IFRS 9 Adoption (cont.) 
 
On November 1, 2017, the Bank classified certain debt securities that were being recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income as at 
October 31, 2017 as measured at amortized cost. As at October 31, 2018, the fair value of these debt securities was $7 million, and the change in fair value 
that would have been recognized in Other comprehensive income for the year ended October 31, 2018 would have been negligible. 
 
On November 1, 2017, the Bank classified certain debt securities that were being recognized at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option as at 
October 31, 2017 as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank sold all of those debt 
securities. 
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Allowances for credit losses amounts established in accordance with IAS 39 as at October 31, 2017 with 
those established in accordance with IFRS 9 as at November 1, 2017.

(1)  On November 1, 2017, the Bank changed the presentation of certain Consolidated Balance Sheet items and reclassified certain amounts. As at October 31, 2017, the Purchased receivables 
item had been presented net of allowances for credit losses. This item is now reported in Loans and in Allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, the 
Allowances for credit losses item as at October 31, 2017 was reduced by $24 million.  
(2)  Impairment remeasurement adjustments include an amount of $58 million in allowances for credit losses recorded for off-balance-sheet commitments such as letters of guarantee and 
documentary letters of credit, undrawn commitments, and backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities. As at October 31, 2017, these allowances had been reported in Allowances 
for credit losses.

Establishing Fair Value 
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price). 
 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets provide the best evidence of fair value. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank applies other 
valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and that minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Such valuation techniques include 
the following: using information available from recent market transactions, referring to the current fair value of a comparable financial instrument, applying

1 discounted cash flow analysis, applying option pricing models, or relying on any other valuation technique that is commonly used by market participants and 
has proven to yield reliable estimates. Judgment is required when applying many of the valuation techniques. The Bank’s valuation was based on its 
assessment of the conditions prevailing as at October 31, 2018 and may change in the future. Furthermore, there may be valuation uncertainty resulting from 
the choice of valuation model used.

Valuation Governance 
Fair value is established in accordance with a rigorous control framework. The Bank has policies and procedures that govern the process for determining fair 
value. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All valuation models are validated, and controls have been 
implemented to ensure that they are applied.  
 
The fair value of existing or new products is determined and validated by functions independent of the risk-taking team. Complex fair value matters are 
reviewed by valuation committees made up of experts from various specialized functions. 
 
For financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Bank has documented the classification policies to determine the hierarchy, and 
there are controls in place to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, reliably and consistently. Valuation methods and the underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on a regular basis. 
 
Valuation Methods and Assumptions 
Financial Instruments Whose Fair Value Equals Carrying Value 
The carrying value of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: 
 
—  cash and deposits with financial institutions; 
—  securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed; 
—  obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned; 
—  customers’ liability under acceptances; 
—  acceptances; 
—  certain items of other assets and other liabilities. 
 
Securities and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short 
These financial instruments, except for securities at amortized cost, are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Their fair value is based on 
quoted prices in active markets, i.e., bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities. If there are no quoted prices in an active market, 
fair value is estimated based on prices for securities that, in substance, are identical. If such prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation 
techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices, the contractual prices of the underlying 
instruments, the time value of money, credit risk, interest rate yield curves and currency rates. 
 
When one or more significant inputs are not observable in the markets, fair value is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that 
consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the specific characteristics of the financial asset or liability and other relevant 
factors. 
 
Securities Issued or Guaranteed by Governments 
Securities issued or guaranteed include government debt securities of the governments of Canada (federal, provincial and municipal) as well as debt securities 
of the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury), of other U.S. agencies and of other foreign governments. The fair value of these securities is based on unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets. For those classified in Level 2, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets are used to determine fair 
value. In the absence of an observable market, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on 
benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. 
 
Equity Securities and Other Debt Securities 
The fair value of equity securities is determined primarily by using quoted prices in active markets. For equity securities and other debt securities classified in 
Level 2, a valuation technique based on quoted prices of identical and similar instruments in an active market is used to determine fair value. In the absence of 
observable inputs, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, 
LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. For those classified in Level 3, fair value can be determined based on the net asset value, which 
represents the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from investment or fund managers or the general partners of the limited 
partnerships. Fair value can also be determined using internal valuation techniques adjusted for risk factors related to the financial instruments and for 
economic conditions.

Note 4 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont.)  
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For exchange-traded derivative financial instruments, fair value 
is based on the quoted price in an active market, i.e., bid prices for financial assets or offered prices for financial liabilities.  
 
For over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments, fair value is determined using well established valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions 
based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices and the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, 
interest rate yield curves, credit curves, currency rates as well as price and rate volatility factors. In establishing the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments, the Bank also incorporates the following factors: 
 
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) 
The CVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. For each counterparty, the CVA is 
based on the expected positive exposure and probabilities of default through time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as 
current and potential future market values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The default probabilities are 
inferred using credit default swap (CDS) spreads. When unavailable, relevant proxies are used. While the general methodology currently assumes 
independence between expected positive exposures and probabilities of default, adjustments are applied to certain types of transactions where there is a 
direct link between the exposure at default and the default probabilities. 
 
Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) 
The DVA reflects the Bank’s own credit risk in the valuation of derivative financial instruments. The DVA is based on the expected negative exposure and 
probabilities of default of the Bank over time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as current and potential future market 
values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The market implied spreads of the Bank are used in the calculation of 
the DVA.  
 
Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) 
The FVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for 
uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. The expected exposures are determined using methodologies consistent with the CVA and DVA 
framework. The funding level used to determine the FVA is based on the average funding level of relevant market participants. 
 
When the valuation techniques incorporate one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the markets, the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, 
the specific characteristics of the financial asset or financial liability and other relevant factors. 
 
Loans 
The fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows, adjusted for several factors, including 
prepayment options, current market interest rates for similar loans, and other relevant variables where applicable. The fair value of variable-rate mortgage 
loans is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of other fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates charged for 
similar new loans. The fair value of other variable-rate loans is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
Deposits 
The fair value of fixed-term deposits is determined primarily by discounting expected future contractual cash flows and considering several factors such as 
redemption options and market interest rates currently offered for financial instruments with similar conditions. For certain term funding instruments, fair 
value is determined using market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of demand deposits and notice deposits is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of structured deposit notes is established using valuation models that maximize the use of observable inputs when available, such as 
benchmark indices, and also incorporates the DVA, which reflects the Bank’s own credit risk. In calculating DVA, the market implied spreads of the Bank are 
used to infer its probabilities of default. Lastly, when fair value is determined using option pricing models, the valuation techniques are similar to those 
described for derivative financial instruments.

Liabilities Related to Transferred Receivables 
These liabilities arise from sale transactions to Canada Housing Trust (CHT) of securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities under 
the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. These transactions do not qualify for derecognition. They are recorded as guaranteed borrowings, which results in 
the recording of liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these liabilities is established using valuation techniques based on observable 
market inputs such as Canada Mortgage Bond prices.  
 
Other Liabilities and Subordinated Debt 
The fair value of these financial liabilities is based on quoted market prices in an active market. If there is no active market, fair value is determined by 
discounting contractual cash flows using the current market interest rates offered for similar financial instruments that have the same term to maturity. 
 
Hierarchy of Fair Value Measurements  
 
IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. This 
fair value hierarchy requires observable market inputs to be used whenever such inputs exist. According to the hierarchy, the highest level of inputs are 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and the lowest level of inputs are unobservable inputs. If inputs from different levels of 
the hierarchy are used, the financial instrument is classified in the same level as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The 
fair value hierarchy has the following levels: 
 
—  Level 1: Inputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the 
measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and 
certain highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.  
—  Level 2:  Valuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the 
market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; 
and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments 
consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, 
certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables and certain other 
liabilities. 
—  Level 3:  Valuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies 
financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The 
valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs. 
 
Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of the following: 
 
—  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss: investments in hedge funds for which there are certain restrictions on unit or security 
redemptions as well as certain derivative financial instruments whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on 
significant unobservable market inputs; 
—  securities at fair value through other comprehensive income: equity and debt securities of private companies; 
—  certain loans and certain deposits (structured deposit notes) whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant 
unobservable market inputs. 
 
Transfers Between the Fair Value Hierarchy Levels 
Transfers of financial instruments between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers to (or from) Level 3 are deemed to have taken place at the beginning of the quarter in 
which the transfer occurred. Significant transfers can occur between the fair value hierarchy levels due to new information on inputs used to determine fair 
value and the observable nature of those inputs.  
 
During fiscal 2018, $324 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $33 million in obligations related to securities sold short 
were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 resulting from changing market conditions ($358 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
and $17 million in obligations related to securities sold short in fiscal 2017). In addition, during fiscal 2018, $37 million in securities classified as at fair value 
through profit or loss and $3 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (for fiscal 2017, $103 million in 
securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $53 million in obligations related to securities sold short). 
 
During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, financial instruments were transferred to (or from) Level 3 due to changes in the availability of observable market inputs 
resulting from changing market conditions.

Significant Unobservable Inputs Used for Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
Net Asset Value 
Net asset value is the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from the investment or fund managers, the administrators of the conduits or 
the general partners of the limited partnerships. The net asset value of a fund is the total fair value of assets less liabilities. 
 
EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) Multiple and Price Equivalent 
Private equity valuation inputs include earnings multiples, which are determined based on comparable companies, and a higher multiple will translate into a 
higher fair value. Price equivalent is a percentage of the market price based on the liquidity of the security. 
 
Discount Rate 
When discounted cash flow methods are used, the discount rate is the input used to bring future cash flows to their present value. A higher discount rate will 
translate into a lower fair value. 
 
Long-Term Volatility 
Volatility is a measure of the expected future variability of market prices. Volatility is generally observable in the market through options prices. However, the 
long-term volatility of options with a longer maturity might not be observable. An increase (decrease) in long-term volatility is generally associated with an 
increase (decrease) in long-term correlation. Higher long-term volatility may increase or decrease an instrument’s fair value depending on its terms. 
 
Market Correlation 
Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two different variables. A positive correlation means that the variables tend to move in the same 
direction; a negative correlation means that the variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to measure financial instruments whose 
future returns depend on several variables. Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument’s fair value depending on the terms of 
its contractual payout. 
 
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
The Bank performs sensitivity analyses for the fair value measurements of financial instruments classified in Level 3, substituting unobservable inputs with 
one or more reasonably possible alternative assumptions.  
 
For equity securities and other debt securities, the Bank varies significant unobservable inputs such as net asset values, EV/EBITDA multiples, or price 
equivalents and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $70 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at 
October 31, 2018 (a $40 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2017).  
 
For the loans, the Bank varies unobservable inputs such as a liquidity premium and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $43 million 
increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2018. As at October 31, 2017, there were no sensitivity analyses as no loans had been 
classified in Level 3. 
 
For derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives related to structured deposit notes, the Bank varies long-term volatility and market correlation 
inputs and establishes a reasonable fair value range. As at October 31, 2018, for derivative financial instruments, the net fair value could result in a $5 million 
increase or decrease ($3 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2017), whereas for structured deposit notes, the fair value could result in a $1 million 
increase or decrease ($1 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2017).

Change in the Fair Value of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
The Bank may hedge the fair value of financial instruments classified in the various levels through offsetting hedge positions. Gains and losses for financial 
instruments classified in Level 3 presented in the following tables do not reflect the inverse gains and losses on financial instruments used for economic

Note 5 – Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss  
  
The Bank chose to designate certain financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss according to the criteria presented in Note 1 to these consolidated 
financial statements. Consistent with its risk management strategy and in accordance with the fair value option, which permits the designation if it eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets and liabilities or recognizing 
the gains and losses thereon on different bases, the Bank designated at fair value through profit or loss certain securities, certain securities purchased under 
reverse repurchase agreements, certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, and certain liabilities related to transferred 
receivables. The fair value of liabilities related to transferred receivables does not include credit risk, as the holders of these liabilities are not exposed to the 
Bank’s credit risk. There is no exposure to credit risk on the loans to the extent that they are fully collateralized. The Bank also designated certain deposits that 
include embedded derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
To determine a change in fair value arising from a change in the credit risk of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank calculates, at 
the beginning of the period, the present value of the instrument’s contractual cash flows using the following rates: first, using an observed discount rate for 
similar securities that reflects the Bank’s credit spread and, then, using a rate that excludes the Bank’s credit spread. The difference obtained between the two 
values is then compared to the difference obtained using the same rates at the end of the period. 
 
Information about the financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the following tables.

(1)  For the year ended October 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss attributable to credit risk, and recorded in Other comprehensive 
income, resulted in a $28 million gain (net loss of $29 million for the year ended October 31, 2017). 
(2)  The amount at maturity that the Bank will be contractually required to pay to the holders of these deposits varies and will differ from the reporting date fair value.

Note 6 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
  
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
 
Generally, over-the-counter financial derivatives subject to master netting arrangements of the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. or other 
similar agreements do not meet the netting criteria on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because the right of set-off is legally enforceable only in the event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy. 
 
Generally, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed as well as obligations related to securities sold under 
repurchase agreements and securities loaned, subject to master agreements, do not meet the netting criteria since they confer a right of set-off that is 
enforceable only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.  
 
However, the above-mentioned transactions may be subject to contractual netting agreements concluded with clearing houses. If the netting criteria are met, 
these transactions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, as part of these transactions, the Bank may give or receive cash or other 
financial instruments used as collateral. 
 
The following tables present information on financial assets and financial liabilities that are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because they meet the 
F11  -  2coul n   etting criteria and on those that are not netted and are subjec t  to an enforcea b le master nett i ng arrangemen t  or similar agre ement.  As at October 31, 2018

Impairment Losses Recognized 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, a negligible amount of impairment charges had been recognized in Gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, net 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and no amounts were reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Income to recognize subsequent increases in the 
fair value of previously impaired debt securities. 
 
Gross Unrealized Losses 
As at October 31, 2017, the Bank had concluded that the gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were mainly due to market price fluctuations 
and to changes in foreign exchange rates and that there was no objective evidence of impairment requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. 
  
Gains (Losses) on Disposals of Securities at Amortized Cost 
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank sold certain debt securities measured at amortized cost given an increase in their credit risk. The carrying 
value of these securities upon disposal was $134 million, and the Bank recognized a negligible gain in Non-interest income – Gains (losses) on non-trading

Held-to-Maturity Securities 
 
As at October 31, 2017, the Bank had concluded that there was no objective evidence of impairment on held-to-maturity securities.

Note 8 – Loans and Allowances for Credit Losses 
  
As at October 31, 2018, loans are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet either at fair value through profit or loss or at amortized cost using the 
financial asset classification criteria defined in IFRS 9. 
 
The information provided in the tables on the following pages is presented in accordance with IFRS 9 as at October 31, 2018 and in accordance with IAS 39 as

Determining and Measuring Expected Credit Losses (ECL) 
 
Determining Expected Credit Losses 
Expected credit losses are determined using a three-stage impairment approach that is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial 
recognition. 
 
—  Stage 1: Financial assets that have experienced no significant increase in credit risk between initial recognition and the reporting date and for which

—  POCI:  Financial assets that are credit-impaired when purchased or originated (POCI) are classified in the POCI category. 
 
Impairment Governance 
A rigorous control framework is applied to the determination of expected credit losses. The Bank has policies and procedures that govern impairments arising 
from credit risk. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management group. All models used to calculate expected credit losses 
are validated, and controls are in place to ensure they are applied.  
 
These models are validated by groups that are independent of the team that prepares the calculations. Complex questions on measurement methodologies 
and assumptions are reviewed by a group of experts from various functions. Furthermore, the inputs and assumptions used to determine expected credit 
losses are reviewed on a regular basis. 
 
Measurement of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) 
Expected credit losses are estimated using three main variables: (1) probability of default (PD), (2) loss given default (LGD) and (3) exposure at default (EAD). 
For accounting purposes, 12-month PD and lifetime PD are the probabilities of a default occurring over the next 12 months or over the life of a financial 
instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and on future economic conditions that have, or will have, an impact on credit 
risk. LGD reflects the losses expected should default occur and considers such factors as the mitigating effects of collateral, the realizable value thereof, and 
the time value of money. EAD is the expected balance owing at default and considers such factors as repayments of principal and interest between the balance 
sheet date and the time of default as well as any amounts expected to be drawn on a committed facility. Twelve-month expected credit losses are estimated by 
multiplying 12-month PD by LGD and by EAD. Lifetime expected credit losses are estimated using the lifetime PD. 
 
For most financial instruments, expected credit losses are measured on an individual basis. Financial instruments that have credit losses measured on a 
collective basis are grouped according to similar credit risk characteristics. 
 
Inputs, Assumptions and Estimation Techniques  
The Bank’s approach to calculating expected credit losses consists essentially of leveraging existing regulatory models and then adjusting their parameters for 
IFRS 9 purposes. These models have the advantage of having been thoroughly tested and validated. In addition, using the same base models, regardless of the 
purpose, provides consistency across risk assessments. These models use inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques that require a high degree of 
management judgment. The main factors that contribute to changes in ECL that are subject to significant judgment include the following:  
 
—  calibration of regulatory parameters in order to obtain point-in-time and forward-looking parameters; 
—  forecasts of macroeconomic variables for multiple scenarios and the probability weighting of the scenarios; 
—  determination of the significant increases in credit risk (SICR) of a loan. 
 
These elements are explained on the following page.

Main parameters  
PD Estimates 
Since the objective of the regulatory calibration of PD is to align historical data to the long-run default rate, adjustments are required to obtain a point-in-time, 
forward-looking PD, as required by IFRS 9. The Bank performs the following: (1) A point-in-time calibration, where the PD of the portfolio is aligned with the 
appropriate default rate. The resulting PD estimate generally equals the prior-year default rate. The prior-year default rate is selected for the calibration 
performed at this stage, as it often reflects one of the most accurate and appropriate estimates of the current-year default rate; (2) Forward-looking 
adjustments are incorporated through, among other measures, a calibration factor based on forecasts produced by the stress testing team's analyses. The 
team considers three macroeconomic scenarios, and, for each scenario, produces a forward-looking assessment covering the three upcoming years. 
 
LGD Estimates 
The LGD estimation method consists of using, for each of the three macroeconomic scenarios, expected LGD based on the LDG values observed using 
backtesting, the economic LGD estimated and used to calculate economic capital, and lastly, the estimated downturn LGD used to calculate regulatory capital. 
 
EAD Estimates 
For term loans, the Bank uses expected EAD, which is the outstanding balance anticipated at each point in time. Expected EAD decreases over time according 
to contractual repayments and to prepayments. For revolving loans, the EAD percentage is based on the percentage estimated by the corresponding regulatory 
model and, thereafter, is converted to dollars according to the authorized balance.

Incorporation of Forward-Looking Information  
The Bank’s Economy and Strategy group is responsible for developing three macroeconomic scenarios and for recommending probability weights for each 
scenario. Macroeconomic scenarios are not developed for specific portfolios, as the Economy and Strategy group provides a set of variables for each of the 
defined scenarios for the next three years. The PDs are also adjusted to incorporate economic assumptions (interest rates, unemployment rates, GDP forecasts, 
oil prices, housing price indices, etc.) that can be statistically tied to PD changes that will have an impact beyond the next 12 months. These statistical 
relationships are determined using the processes developed for stress testing. In addition, the group considers other relevant factors that may not be 
adequately reflected in the information used to calculate the PDs (including late payments and whether the financial asset is subject to additional monitoring 
within the watchlist process for business and government loan portfolios). 
 
Determination of a Significant Increase in the Credit Risk of a Financial Instrument 
At each reporting period, the Bank determines whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by examining the change in the risk of 
default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. First, the Bank compares the point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD at the 
reporting date with the expected point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD established at initial recognition. Based on this comparison, the Bank 
determines whether the loan has deteriorated when compared to the initial conditions. Because the comparison includes an adjustment based on origination-
date forward-looking information and reporting-date forward-looking information, the deterioration may be caused by the following factors: (i) deterioration of 
the economic outlook used in the forward-looking assessment; (ii) deterioration of the borrower’s conditions (payment defaults, worsening financial ratios, 
etc.); or (iii) a combination of both factors. The quantitative criteria used to determine a significant increase in credit risk is a series of relative and absolute 
thresholds, and a backstop is also applied. All financial instruments that are 30 days past but below 90 days past due are migrated to Stage 2, even if the 
other criteria do not indicate a significant increase in credit risk.  
 
Credit Quality of Loans 
 
The following table presents the gross carrying amounts of loans as at October 31, 2018, according to credit quality and ECL impairment stage of each loan 
category at amortized cost, and according to credit quality for loans at fair value through profit or loss. For additional information on credit quality according to 
the Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) categories, see the “Credit Risk Management” section of the MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2018.

Main Macroeconomic Factors 
 
The following table shows the main macroeconomic factors used to estimate the allowances for credit losses on loans. For each scenario, namely, the base 
case, upside scenario and downside scenario, the average values of the factors over the next 12 months (used for Stage 1 credit loss calculations) and over the 
remaining forecast period (used for Stage 2 credit loss calculations) are presented.

   (5)  The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil pricing index is commonly used as a benchmark. 
 
The main macroeconomic factors used for the personal credit portfolio are unemployment rate and housing price index. The main macroeconomic factors used 
for the business and government credit portfolio are GDP growth, BBB spread, S&P/TSX growth, and WTI oil price. 
 
An increase in unemployment rate or BBB spread will generally correlate with higher allowances for credit losses, whereas an increase in the other 
macroeconomic factors (GDP growth, S&P/TSX growth, housing price index, and WTI oil price) will generally correlate with lower allowances for credit losses.

Note 9 – Financial Assets Transferred But Not Derecognized 
  
In the normal course of its business, the Bank enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets such as securities or loans directly to third parties, 
in particular structured entities. According to the terms of some of those transactions, the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards related to 
those financial assets. The risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk and other price risks, whereas the rewards 
include income streams associated with the financial assets. As such, those financial assets are not derecognized and the transactions are treated as 
collateralized or secured borrowings. The nature of those transactions is described below. 
 
Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned 
When securities are sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned under securities lending agreements, the Bank transfers financial assets to third 
parties in accordance with the standard terms for such transactions. These third parties may have an unlimited right to resell or repledge the financial assets 
received. If cash collateral is received, the Bank records the cash along with an obligation to return the cash, which is included in Obligations related to 
securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are received as collateral, the Bank 
does not record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Financial Assets Transferred to Structured Entities 
Under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program, the Bank sells securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities to Canada Housing 
Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of insured mortgage bonds. Third-party CMB investors have legal recourse only to the

   The following table provides additional information about the nature of the transferred financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition and the associated 
liabilities.

     64,118  61,183   
     
Fair value of associated liabilities(2)    32,809  33,356 
 
(1)  The amount related to the securities loaned is the maximum amount of Bank securities that can be lent. For the obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, the 
amount includes the Bank’s own financial assets as well as those of third parties. 
(2)  Associated liabilities include obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements before the offsetting impact of $287 million as at October 31, 2018 ($1,621 million as at 
October 31, 2017) and liabilities related to transferred receivables. Liabilities related to securities loaned are not included, as the Bank can lend its own financial assets and those of third 
parties. The carrying value and fair value of liabilities related to securities loaned were $7,550 million as at October 31, 2018 ($10,156 million as at October 31, 2017). 
 
The following table specifies the nature of the transactions related to financial assets transferred but not derecognized.

As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no significant restrictions limiting the ability of associates and joint ventures to transfer funds to the Bank in the 
form of dividends or to repay any loans or advances. Furthermore, the Bank has not made any specific commitment or contracted any contingent liability with 
respect to associates or joint ventures. 
 
TMX Group Limited 
TMX Group Limited is a Canadian corporation that directly or indirectly controls a number of entities that operate stock exchanges and clearing houses and 
provide clearing and settlement services. During the year ended October 31, 2018, TMX Group Limited paid $10 million in dividends to the Bank ($9 million for 
the year ended October 31, 2017). 
 
Fiera Capital Corporation 
Fiera Capital Corporation is an independent Canadian investment management firm. During the year ended October 31, 2018, Fiera Capital Corporation paid 
$13 million in dividends to the Bank ($12 million for the year ended October 31, 2017). 
 
Maple Financial Group Inc. 
The Bank has a 24.9% equity interest in Maple Financial Group Inc. (Maple), a privately owned Canadian company that operated through direct and indirect 
wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. In August 2016, Maple filed for bankruptcy under applicable 
Canadian laws, and a trustee was appointed to administer the company. Similar proceedings were initiated for each of Maple’s other material subsidiaries in 
their home jurisdictions.  
 
Maple Bank GmbH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Maple, has been the subject of an investigation into alleged tax irregularities by German 
prosecutors since September 2015 and, to the Bank’s knowledge, that investigation is ongoing. The Bank understands that the investigation is focusing on 
selected trading activities by Maple Bank GmbH and some of its current and former employees during taxation years 2006 to 2010, although the Bank has 
been advised that the investigation may also extend to subsequent taxation years. The German authorities have alleged that these trading activities violated 
German tax laws. Neither the Bank nor its employees were involved in these trading activities and, to the Bank’s knowledge, are not the subject of this 
investigation. 
 
On February 6, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple Bank GmbH, 
preventing it from carrying out its normal business activities. In light of the situation, the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity interest in Maple in an 
amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income taxes) during the first quarter of 2016. The $164 million write-off of the equity interest in this associate 
was recognized in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2016 and was reported in the 
Financial Markets segment. 
 
The Bank has advised the German authorities that if it is determined that portions of dividends received from Maple could be reasonably attributable to tax 
fraud by Maple Bank GmbH, arrangements will be made to repay those amounts to the relevant authority. If any repayments are required, they are not 
expected to be material to the Bank’s financial position.

   (2)  During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, acquired Groupe Financier Abi-Témi inc. located in Rouyn-Noranda, Canada. 
 
Goodwill Impairment Testing and Significant Assumptions 
For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting from a business combination must be allocated to a CGU or a group of CGUs 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable value of the CGU or group of CGUs may have fallen below its carrying amount. 
 
Goodwill was tested for impairment during the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, and no impairment loss was recognized. 
 
The recoverable value of a CGU or group of CGUs is based on the value in use that is calculated based on discounted pre-tax cash flows. Future pre-tax cash 
flows are estimated based on a five-year period, which is the reference period used for the most recent financial forecasts approved by management. Cash 
flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate. 
 
The discount rate used for each CGU or group of CGUs is calculated using the cost of debt financing and the cost related to the Bank’s equity. This rate 
corresponds to the Bank’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risk specific to the CGU. The long-term growth rate used in calculating discounted 
cash flow estimates is based on the forecasted growth rate plus a risk premium. The rate is constant over the entire five-year period for which the cash flows 
were determined. Growth rates are determined, among other factors, based on past growth rates, economic trends, inflation, competition and the impact of the 
Bank’s strategic initiatives. As at October 31, 2018, for each CGU or CGU group, the discount rate used was 12.8% (13.2% as at October 31, 2017) and the 
long-term growth rate was between 2.0% and 5.0% depending on the CGU as at October 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 
Estimating a CGU’s value in use requires significant judgment regarding the inputs used in applying the discounted cash flow method. The Bank conducts 
sensitivity analyses by varying the after-tax discount rate upward by 1% and the terminal growth rates down by 1%. Such sensitivity analyses demonstrate that 
a reasonable change in assumptions would not result in a CGU’s carrying value exceeding its value in use.

Note 16 – Subordinated Debt 
  
The subordinated debt represents direct unsecured obligations, in the form of notes and debentures, to the Bank’s debt holders. The rights of the Bank’s note 
and debenture holders are subordinate to the claims of depositors and certain other creditors. Approval from OSFI is required before the Bank can redeem its 
subordinated notes and debentures in whole or in part. 
 
On February 1, 2018, the Bank issued medium-term notes for a total amount of $750 million, bearing interest at 3.183% and maturing on February 1, 2028.

(1)  Bearing interest at a rate of 3.183%, payable semi-annually until February 1, 2023, and thereafter bearing interest at a floating rate equal to the rate on three-month CDOR plus 0.72%, 
payable quarterly. 
(2)  With the prior approval of OSFI, the Bank may, at its option, redeem these notes as of February 1, 2023, in whole or in part, at their nominal value plus accrued and unpaid interest. These 
notes contain non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions and qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. In the case of a trigger event as defined by OSFI, 
each note will be automatically and immediately converted, on a full and permanent basis, without the consent of the holder, into a specified number of common shares of the Bank as 
determined using an automatic conversion formula with a multiplier of 1.5 and a conversion price based on the greater of: (i) a floor price of $5.00; (ii) the current market price of common 
shares, which represents the volume weighted average price of common shares for the ten trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common 
shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank’s Board. The number of shares issued is 
determined by dividing the par value of the note (plus accrued and unpaid interest on such note) by the conversion price and then applying the multiplier. 
(3)  Debentures denominated in foreign currency totalling US$7 million as at October 31, 2018 (2017: US$7 million) and bearing interest at a rate of 1/8% above six-month LIBOR. 
(4)  The unamortized costs related to the issuance of the subordinated debt represent the initial cost, net of accumulated amortization, calculated using the effective interest rate method.

Forwards and futures are contractual obligations to buy or deliver a specified amount of currency, interest rate, commodity or financial instrument on a 
specified future date at a specified price. Forwards are tailor-made agreements transacted in the over-the-counter market. Futures are traded on organized 
exchanges and are subject to cash margining calculated daily by clearing houses. 
 
Swaps 
Swaps are over-the-counter contracts in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows. The Bank uses the following types of swap contracts: 
 
—  Cross-currency swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed-rate interest payments and principal payments in different currencies. 
—  Interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate interest payments, based on the notional principal value in 
the same currency. 
—  Commodity swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate payments, based on the notional principal value of a 
commodity. 
—  Equity swaps are transactions in which counterparties agree to exchange the return on one equity or group of equities for a payment based on a 
benchmark interest rate. 
—  Credit default swaps are transactions in which one of the parties agrees to pay returns to the other party so that the latter can make a payment if a credit 
event occurs. 
 
Options  
Options are agreements between two parties in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell, either at a 
specified date or dates or at any time prior to a predetermined expiry date, a specific amount of currency, commodity or financial instrument at an agreed-upon 
price upon the sale of the option. The writer receives a premium for the sale of this instrument.

Credit Risk   
Credit risk on derivative financial instruments is the risk of financial loss that the Bank will have to assume if a counterparty fails to honour its contractual 
obligations. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is subject to the same credit approval, credit limit and monitoring standards as those applied 
to the Bank’s other credit transactions. Consequently, the Bank evaluates the creditworthiness of counterparties and monitors the size of the portfolios as well 
as the diversification and maturity profiles of these financial instruments. 
 
The Bank limits the credit risk of over-the-counter contracts by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and entering into contracts that provide for the 
exchange of collateral between parties where the fair value of the outstanding transactions exceeds an agreed threshold. The Bank also negotiates master 
netting agreements that provide for the simultaneous close-out and settling of all transactions with a given counterparty in the event of default, insolvency or 
bankruptcy. However, overall exposure to credit risk, reduced through master netting agreements, may change substantially after the balance sheet date 
because it is affected by all transactions subject to a contract as well as by changes in the market rates of the underlying instruments. 
 
The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to have access to established clearing houses in order to minimize the settlement risk for certain financial 
derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank has direct access to clearing houses for settling derivative financial instruments. In addition, certain 
derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties. 
 
In the case of exchange-traded contracts, exposure to credit risk is limited because these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established 
exchanges, each of which is associated with a well-capitalized clearing house that assumes the obligations of both counterparties and guarantees their 
performance obligations. All exchange-traded contracts are subject to initial margins and daily settlement. 
 
Terms Used 
Replacement Cost 
Replacement cost is the Bank’s maximum credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This amount 
is the positive fair value of all over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, before all master netting agreements and collateral held. 
 
Credit Risk Equivalent 
The credit risk equivalent amount is the total replacement cost plus an amount representing the potential future credit risk exposure, as outlined in OSFI’s 
Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline. 
 
Risk-Weighted Amount 
The risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the OSFI guidance to the credit risk equivalent.

Fair Value Hedges 
 
Fair value hedge transactions consist of using derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps and options) to hedge changes in the fair value of a 
financial asset or financial liability caused by interest rate fluctuations. Changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used as hedging 
instruments offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to portfolios of securities measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, fixed-rate deposits, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and subordinated debt. 
 
In addition, when a fixed-rate asset or liability is denominated in a foreign currency, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the associated 
foreign exchange risk. The Bank may designate a cross-currency swap to exchange the fixed-rate foreign currency for the functional currency at a floating rate 
in a single hedging relationship addressing both interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign 
exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of 
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to foreign currency fixed-rate deposits. 
 
Regression analysis is used to test hedge effectiveness and determine the hedge ratio. For fair value hedges, the main source of potential hedge 
ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned. 
 
The following tables show amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the fair value hedges.

Cash Flow Hedges  
 
 
Cash flow hedge transactions consist of using interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows caused by floating-rate assets or liabilities. 
In addition, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk caused by assets or liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not 
distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this 
strategy mainly to its loan, personal credit line, acceptance, and deposit portfolios.  
 
The Bank also uses total return swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows related to the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan. Some of these swaps 
are designated as part of a cash flow hedge against a portion of the unrecognized obligation of the RSU Plan. In cash flow hedges, the derivative financial 
instruments used as hedging instruments reduce the variability of the future cash flows related to the hedged items. 
 
Regression analysis is used to assess hedge effectiveness and to determine the hedge ratio. For cash flow hedges, the main source of potential hedge 
ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned. 
 
The following tables show the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the cash flow hedges.

Note 18 – Hedging Activities (cont.) 
 
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations  
 
The Bank’s structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The Bank 
measures this risk by assessing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and hedges it using derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (cross-
currency swaps and deposits). In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), the financial instruments used offset the foreign 
exchange gains and losses on the investments. When non-derivative financial instruments are designated as foreign exchange risk hedges, only the changes 
in fair value that are attributable to foreign exchange risk are taken into account when assessing and calculating the effectiveness of the hedge.  
 
Assessing the effectiveness of net investment hedges consists of comparing changes in the carrying value of the deposits or the fair value of the derivative 
attributable to exchange rate fluctuations with changes in the net investment in a foreign operation attributable to exchange rate fluctuations. Inasmuch as the 
notional amount of the hedging instruments and the hedged net investments are aligned, no ineffectiveness is expected. 
 
The following table presents the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the net investment hedges.

(1)  Redeemable in cash at the Bank’s option, in whole or in part, subject to the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) and to OSFI approval. Redemption prices are increased by all the declared 
and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares to the date fixed for redemption. 
(2)  Convertible at the option of the holders of first preferred shares, subject to certain conditions. 
(3)  The dividends are non-cumulative and payable quarterly, except for Series 23, for which the dividends are payable semi-annually. 
(4)  Upon the occurrence of a trigger event as defined by OSFI, each outstanding preferred share will be automatically and immediately converted, on a full and permanent basis, without the 
consent of the holder, into a number of common shares of the Bank determined pursuant to an automatic conversion formula. This conversion will be calculated by dividing the value of the 
preferred shares, i.e., $25.00 per share, plus all declared and unpaid dividends as at the date of the trigger event, by the value of the common shares. The value of the common shares will 
be the greater of a $5.00 floor price or the current market price of the common shares. Current market price means the volume weighted average trading price of common shares for the ten 
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the 
3 price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank’s Board.

(5)  Redeemable as of the date fixed for redemption and on the same date every five years thereafter. 
(6)  Convertible as of the date fixed for conversion and on the same date every five years thereafter, subject to certain conditions. 
(7)  The dividend amount is set for the initial period ending on the date fixed for redemption. Thereafter, these shares carry a non-cumulative quarterly fixed dividend in an amount per share 
determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the sum of the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield on the applicable fixed-rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset 
premium. 
(8)  For additional information, see Note 20 to these consolidated financial statements.  
(9)  As of the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price will be $25.50 per share. Thereafter, on the same date every five years, the redemption price will be $25.00 per share. 
(10)  The dividend period begins as of the date fixed for redemption. The amount of the floating quarterly non-cumulative dividend is determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the 
sum of the 90-day Government of Canada treasury bill yield on the floating rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset premium.

Issuances of Preferred Shares 
On June 11, 2018, the Bank issued 12,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 42 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share for 
gross proceeds of $300 million. Given that the Series 42 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
On January 22, 2018, the Bank issued 12,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 40 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share for 
gross proceeds of $300 million. Given that the Series 40 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
On June 13, 2017, the Bank had issued 16,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 38 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share for 
gross proceeds of $400 million. Given that the Series 38 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
Redemption of Preferred Shares 
On November 15, 2017, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 28 First Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the 
share conditions, the redemption price was $25.00 per share plus the periodic dividend declared and unpaid. The Bank redeemed 8,000,000 Series 28 
preferred shares for a total amount of $200 million, which reduced Preferred share capital.

Repurchases of Common Shares 
On June 6, 2018, the Bank began a normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 8,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 
2.36% of its outstanding common shares) over the 12-month period ending no later than June 5, 2019. On June 5, 2017, the Bank had begun a normal course 
issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 6,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 1.76% of its outstanding common shares) over the 
12-month period ended June 4, 2018. Any repurchase through the Toronto Stock Exchange will be done at market prices. The common shares may also be 
repurchased through other means authorized by the Toronto Stock Exchange and applicable regulations, including private agreements or share repurchase 
programs under issuer bid exemption orders issued by the securities regulators. A private purchase made under an exemption order issued by a securities 
regulator will be done at a discount to the prevailing market prices. The amounts that will be paid above the average book value of the common shares will be 
charged to Retained earnings. During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank repurchased 7,500,000 common shares for $467 million, which reduced 
Common share capital by $64 million and Retained earnings by $403 million.  
 
Reserved Common Shares 
As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, 15,507,568 common shares were reserved under the Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan. As at 
October 31, 2018, 22,894,802 common shares (25,764,866 as at October 31, 2017) were reserved under the Stock Option Plan. 
 
Common Shares Held in Escrow 
As part of the acquisition of Wellington West Holdings Inc. in 2011, the Bank had issued common shares held in escrow. In December 2016, 799,563 of these 
shares were released to shareholders, and 108,341 shares were cancelled, mainly upon the settlement of certain indemnifications guaranteed by those 
shares. During the year ended October 31, 2018, 3,778 of these shares were released to shareholders and 1,206 shares were cancelled. As at

Restriction on the Payment of Dividends  
The Bank is prohibited from declaring dividends on its common or preferred shares if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Bank would, by so 
doing, be in contravention of the regulations of the Bank Act (Canada) or OSFI’s capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. In addition, the ability to pay 
common share dividends is restricted by the terms of the outstanding preferred shares pursuant to which the Bank may not pay dividends on its common 
shares without the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, unless all preferred share dividends have been declared and paid or set aside 
for payment. Moreover, if NBC Asset Trust were unable to pay the full amount of distributions on the trust units, the Bank would withhold from declaring 
dividends on any of its preferred and common shares during a determined period. For additional information, see Notes 20 and 28 to these consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
The Bank has a dividend reinvestment plan for common and preferred shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional. Under the terms and conditions of the 
plan, participants acquire shares through the reinvestment of cash dividends paid on the shares they hold or through optional cash payments. Common shares 
subscribed by participants are purchased on their behalf in the secondary market through the Bank’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, 
at a price equal to the average purchase price of the common shares during the ten business days immediately following the dividend payment date.

the balance included $10 million in accrued interest. 
(2)  Includes $9 million in accrued interest ($9 million as at October 31, 2017). 
 
Trust Units Issued by NBC Asset Trust 
Through structured entity NBC Asset Trust (the Trust), a closed-end trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario, the Bank issued transferable 
non-voting trust units called “Trust Capital Securities” or “NBC CapS II.” These securities are not redeemable or exchangeable for Bank preferred shares at the 
option of the holder. The gross proceeds from the issuance were used by the Trust to finance the acquisition of mortgage loans from the Bank. For additional 
information, see Note 28 to these consolidated financial statements. 
F13  -  2coul  T  he main terms and characteristics of the NBC CapS II trust units outstanding as at October 31, 2018 are presented below.

Series 2  350,000  June 30, 2008  7.447 %  December 31  $37.235(2) 
 
(1)  For each unit with a face value of $1,000. 
(2)  For each distribution date after June 30, 2020, the distribution will be paid at a rate equal to one-half the sum of the 180-day bankers’ acceptance rate in effect plus 4.09%. 
 
Distribution 
No cash distributions will be payable by the Trust on NBC CapS II if the Bank fails to declare regular dividends on its preferred shares or, if no preferred shares 
are then outstanding, on its outstanding common shares. In this case, the net distributable funds of the Trust will be paid to the Bank as the sole holder of the 
special trust securities, representing the residual interest in the Trust. Should the Trust fail to pay the semi-annual distributions in full on the NBC CapS II, the 
Bank will withhold from declaring dividends on any of its preferred and common shares during a determined period. 
 
Automatic Exchange 
Each NBC CapS II – Series 2 can be exchanged automatically, without the consent of the holders, for 40 Series 23 First Preferred Shares of the Bank upon the 
occurrence of one of the following events: (i) proceedings are commenced for the winding-up of the Bank; (ii) OSFI takes control of the Bank; (iii) the Bank posts 
a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 5% or a Total capital ratio of less than 8%; or (iv) OSFI has directed the Bank to increase its capital or to provide additional 
liquidity and the Bank elects such automatic exchange or the Bank fails to comply with such direction to the satisfaction of OSFI. On an automatic exchange, 
the Bank will hold all outstanding trust capital securities of the Trust. 
 
Redemption at the Option of the Trust 
On any distribution date, the Trust may, subject to prior written notice and OSFI approval, redeem, at its option, the NBC CapS II – Series 2, in whole but not in  3
1
part, without the consent of the holders.  
 
Purchase for Cancellation 
The Trust may, with OSFI approval, purchase NBC CapS II – Series 2, in whole or in part, on the open market or by tender or private contract at any price. The 
NBC CapS II purchased by the Trust, if any, will be cancelled and will not be reissued. 
 
Regulatory Capital 
The NBC CapS II – Series 2 qualify as innovative capital instruments and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do not satisfy 
the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be phased out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022.

Note 21 – Capital Disclosure 
  
Capital Management Objectives, Policies and Procedures 
Capital management has a dual role of ensuring a competitive return to the Bank’s shareholders while maintaining a solid capital foundation that covers the 
risks inherent to the Bank’s business, supports its business segments and protects its clients. 
 
The Bank’s capital management policy defines the guiding principles as well as the roles and responsibilities regarding its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process. This process is a key tool in establishing the Bank’s capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments. 
 
Capital Management 
Capital ratios are obtained by dividing regulatory capital by risk-weighted assets and are expressed as a percentage. Risk-weighted assets are calculated in 
accordance with the rules established by OSFI for on- and off-balance-sheet risks. Credit, market and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted 
assets calculation for regulatory purposes. The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types 
of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, intangible assets and other capital deductions. The 
Additional Tier 1 instruments comprise eligible non-cumulative preferred shares and the eligible amount of innovative instruments. The sum of CET1 and 
Additional Tier 1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of the eligible portion of subordinated debt and certain allowances for 
credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
 
The Basel III regulatory framework sets out transitional arrangements for the period of 2013 to 2019. However, OSFI is requiring Canadian banks to meet the 
2019 minimum “all-in” requirements rather than the minimum ratios calculated using the transitional methodology. The “all-in” methodology includes all of 
the regulatory adjustments that will be required by 2019 while retaining the phase-out rules for non-qualifying capital instruments. Consequently, the Bank 
and all other major Canadian banks have had to maintain, on an "all-in" basis, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, and a 
Total capital ratio of at least 11.5%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a 1% surcharge applicable to Domestic 
Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs). The banks also have to meet the revised capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II 
standardized approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 75% of the capital requirements as calculated under Basel II, the difference is 
added to risk-weighted assets. In addition, during the year ended October 31, 2018, OSFI introduced a domestic stability buffer of 1.5% that must be 
maintained by the DSIBs. This buffer is exclusively made up of CET1 capital. 
 
OSFI has also been requiring Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is 
calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative 
exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total 
exposure. 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI’s regulatory capital requirements.

Note 22 – Trading Activity Revenues  
  
Trading activity revenues consist of the net interest income from trading activities and of trading revenues recognized in Non-interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Net interest income comprises dividends related to financial assets and liabilities associated with trading activities, net of interest expenses and interest 
income related to the financing of these financial assets and liabilities. 
 
Non-interest income consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses as well as interest income on securities measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
income from held-for-trading derivative financial instruments, changes in the fair value of loans at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss.

Stock Option Plan 
The Bank’s Stock Option Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this plan, options are awarded annually and 
provide participants with the right to purchase common shares at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange on the day preceding the award. The options vest evenly over a four-year period and expire ten years from the award date or, in certain 
circumstances set out in the plan, within specified time limits. The Stock Option Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s 
rights to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement. The maximum number of common shares that may be issued under the 
Stock Option Plan was 22,894,802 as at October 31, 2018 (25,764,866 as at October 31, 2017). The number of common shares reserved for a participant may 
not exceed 5% of the total number of Bank shares issued and outstanding.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily representative of how options will be exercised in the future. Expected 
volatility is extrapolated from the implied volatility of the Bank’s share price and observable market inputs, which are not necessarily representative of actual 
results. The expected dividend yield represents the annualized dividend divided by the Bank’s share price at the award date. The risk-free interest rate is based 
on the Canadian dollar swap curve at the award date. The exercise price is equal to the Bank’s share price at the award date. No other market parameter has 
been included in the fair value measurement of the options. 
 
The compensation expense recorded for this plan for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $12 million ($11 million for the year ended October 31, 2017). 
 
Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan 
The SAR Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this plan, participants receive, upon exercising the right, a 
cash amount equal to the difference between the closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the exercise 
date and the closing price on the day preceding the award date. SARs vest evenly over a four-year period and expire 10 years after the award date or, in certain 
circumstances set out in the plan, within specified time limits. The SAR Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s rights to 
continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement. A compensation expense of $1 million was recognized for the year ended 
October 31, 2018 with respect to this plan ($4 million for the year ended October 31, 2017).

Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plans 
The DSU Plans are for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries as well as directors. These plans allow the Bank to tie a portion of 
the value of the compensation of participants to the future value of the Bank’s common shares. A DSU is a right that has a value equal to the closing price of a 
common share of the Bank on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the award. DSUs generally vest evenly over four years. Additional DSUs are 
credited to the participant’s account equal in amount to the dividends paid on common shares of the Bank and vest evenly over the same period as the 
reference DSUs. DSUs may only be cashed when participants retire or leave the Bank, or for directors, when their term ends. The DSU Plan contains provisions 
for retiring employees that allow the participant’s units to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank awarded 44,713 DSUs at a weighted average price of $63.68 (74,436 DSUs at a weighted average price of 
$54.69 for the year ended October 31, 2017). A total of 591,360 DSUs were outstanding as at October 31, 2018 (637,989 DSUs as at October 31, 2017). A 
compensation expense of $7 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2018 with respect to these plans ($14 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2017).

Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan 
The RSU Plan is for certain officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. The objective of this plan is to ensure that the compensation 
of certain officers and other designated persons is competitive and to foster retention. An RSU represents a right that has a value equal to the average closing 
price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December. RSUs 
generally vest evenly over three years, although some RSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the third year following the date of the award, the 
date on which all RSUs expire. Additional RSUs are credited to the participant’s account equal in amount to the dividends declared on the common shares of 
the Bank and vest evenly over the same period as the reference RSUs. The RSU Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s units 
to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank awarded 2,158,594 RSUs at a weighted average price of $63.57 (2,411,016 RSUs at a weighted average 
price of $51.21 for the year ended October 31, 2017). As at October 31, 2018, a total of 5,072,615 RSUs were outstanding (5,156,316 RSUs as at October 31, 
2017). A compensation expense of $140 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2018 with respect to this plan ($174 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2017). 
 
Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan 
The PSU Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank. The objective of this plan is to tie a portion of the value of the compensation of these 
officers and other designated persons to the future value of the Bank’s common shares. A PSU represents a right that has a value equal to the average closing 
price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December, 
adjusted upward or downward according to performance criteria, which is based on the total shareholder return (TSR) over three years achieved by the Bank 
compared to that of the S&P/TSX Banks adjusted sub-index. PSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the third year following the date of the award, 
the date on which all PSUs expire. Additional PSUs are credited to the participant’s account in an amount equal to the dividends declared on the Bank’s 
common shares and vest evenly over the same period as the reference PSUs. The PSU Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the 
participant’s units to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank awarded 287,206 PSUs at a weighted average price of $63.57 (345,237 PSUs at a weighted average price of 
$51.21 for the year ended October 31, 2017). As at October 31, 2018, a total of 969,322 PSUs were outstanding (881,701 PSUs as at October 31, 2017). A 
compensation expense of $21 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2018 with respect to this plan ($24 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2017). 
 
Deferred Compensation Plan of National Bank Financial (NBF) 
This plan is exclusively for key employees of NBF Wealth Management. The purpose of this plan is to foster the retention of key employees and promote the 
growth in income and the continuous improvement in profitability at Wealth Management. Under this plan, participants can defer a portion of their annual 
compensation and NBF may pay a contribution to key employees when certain financial objectives are met. Amounts awarded by NBF and the compensation 
deferred by participants are invested in, among others, Bank common share units. These share units represent a right, the value of which corresponds to the 
closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the award date. Additional units are paid to the participant’s account equal in 
amount to the dividends declared on the Bank’s common shares. Share units representing the amounts awarded by NBF vest evenly over four years. When a 
participant retires, or in certain cases when the participant’s employment is terminated, the participant receives a cash amount representing the value of the 
vested share units.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, NBF awarded 132,544 share units at a weighted average price of $63.63 (132,226 share units at a weighted average 
price of $55.36 for the year ended October 31, 2017). As at October 31, 2018, 1,618,166 share units were outstanding (1,598,966 share units as at 
October 31, 2017). During the year ended October 31, 2018, a $3 million compensation expense reversal related to a decline in share value was recognized for 
this plan ($24 million compensation expense for the year ended October 31, 2017). 
 
Employee Share Ownership Plan 
Under the Bank’s Employee Share Ownership Plan, employees who meet the eligibility criteria can contribute up to 8% of their annual gross salary by way of 
payroll deductions. The Bank matches 25% of the employee contribution up to a maximum of $1,500 per annum. Bank contributions vest to the employee after 
one year of uninterrupted participation in the plan. Subsequent contributions vest immediately. The Bank’s contributions, amounting to $9 million for the year 
ended October 31, 2018 ($10 million for the year ended October 31, 2017), were charged to Compensation and employee benefits when paid. As at 
October 31, 2018, a total of 5,718,242 common shares were held for this plan (5,961,203 common shares as at October 31, 2017). 
 
Plan shares are purchased on the open market and are considered to be outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Dividends paid on the Bank’s 
common shares held for the Employee Share Ownership Plan are used to purchase other common shares on the open market.

Note 24 – Employee Benefits – Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
  
The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The pension plans provide benefits based on 
years of plan participation and average earnings at retirement. The other post-employment benefit plans include post-retirement medical, dental and life 
insurance coverage. The pension plans are funded whereas the other plans are not funded. The fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation are measured as at October 31. 
 
The Bank’s most significant pension plan is the Employee Pension Plan of the National Bank of Canada; it is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue 
Agency and subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the Income Tax Act. 
 
The defined benefit plans expose the Bank to specific risks such as investment performance, changes to the discount rate used to calculate the obligation, the 
longevity of plan members and future inflation. While management believes that the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation process are reasonable, there 
remains a degree of risk and uncertainty that may cause future results to differ significantly from these assumptions, which could give rise to gains or losses. 
 
According to the Bank’s governance rules, the policies and risk management related to the defined benefit plans are overseen at different levels by the pension 
committees, the Bank’s management and the Board’s Human Resources Committee. The defined benefit plans are examined on an ongoing basis in order to 
monitor the funding and investment policies, the plans’ financial status and the Bank’s funding requirements. 
 
The Bank’s funding policy for the defined benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by pension regulators.  
 
For funded plans, the Bank determines whether an economic benefit exists in the form of potential reductions in future contributions and in the form of refunds 
from the plan surplus, where permitted by applicable regulations and plan provisions.

The Bank’s investment strategy for plan assets considers several factors, including the time horizon of pension plan obligations and investment risk. For each 
plan, an allocation range per asset class is defined using a mix of equity and debt securities to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets and minimize 
asset/liability mismatching. 
 
The pension plan assets may include investment securities issued by the Bank. As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, the pension plan assets do not include any 
securities issued by the Bank. 
 
During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank sold $30 million in units of a private investment fund that it was holding to the pension plan. These units 
are reported in the Equity securities not quoted in an active market category.

Significant Actuarial Assumptions (Weighted Average)  
 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate assumption is based on an interest rate curve that represents the yields on corporate AA bonds. Short-term maturities are obtained using a 
curve based on observed data from corporate AA bonds. Long-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data and extrapolated data. 
 
In order to measure the pension plan and other post-employment plan obligation, the vested benefits that the Bank expects to pay in each future period are 
discounted to the measurement date using the spot rate associated with each of the respective periods based on the yield curve derived using the above 
methodology. The sum of discounted benefit amounts represents the defined benefit obligation. An average discount rate that replicates this obligation is then 
computed.  
 
To better reflect current service cost, a separate discount rate was determined to account for the timing of future benefit payments associated with the 
additional year of service to be earned by the plan’s active participants. Since these benefits are, on average, being paid at a later date than the benefits 
already earned by participants as a whole (i.e., longer duration), this method results in the use of a generally higher discount rate for calculating current 
service cost than that used to measure obligations where the yield curve is positively sloped. The methodology used to determine this discount rate is the 
same as the one used to establish the discount rate for measuring the obligation.

For measurement purposes, the estimated annual growth rate for health care costs was 5.23% in 2018 (5.28% in 2017). Based on the assumption retained, 
this rate is expected to decrease gradually to 3.50% in 2038 and remain steady thereafter.  
 
The mortality assumption is a determining factor when measuring the defined benefit obligation. Determining the expected benefit payout period is based on 
best estimate assumptions regarding mortality. Mortality tables are reviewed at least once a year, and the assumptions made are in accordance with accepted 
actuarial practice. New results regarding the plans are reviewed and used in calculating best estimates of future mortality.

According to forecasts, which are based on information available on October 31, 2018, the Bank believes that it is probable that the results of future 
operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize all the deferred tax assets before they expire. 
  
As at October 31, 2018, the total amount of temporary differences, unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognized was $369 million ($383 million as at October 31, 2017). 
 
As at October 31, 2018, the total amount of temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures for which no deferred 
tax liability has been recognized was $1,972 million ($1,057  million as at October 31, 2017).

Notice of Assessment 
  
In September 2018, the Bank was reassessed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for additional income tax and interest of approximately $130 million 
(including estimated provincial tax and interest) in respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during 2013. 
In May 2017, the Bank had been reassessed for additional income tax and interest of approximately $77 million (including provincial tax and interest) in 
respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during 2012. 
 
The transactions to which these reassessments relate are similar to those prospectively addressed by the synthetic equity arrangement rules introduced in the 
2015 Canadian federal budget. 
 
Also in July 2018, the CRA confirmed in writing that, except for the above-mentioned reassessment for 2012, it would not pursue the proposed reassessment in 
respect of 2011 and 2012 that had been communicated to the Bank in March 2017. 
 
The CRA may issue reassessments to the Bank for taxation years subsequent to 2013 in regard to activities similar to those that were the subject of the 2013 
and 2012 reassessments. The Bank remains confident that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously defend its position. As a result, no 
amount has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2018.

Note 26 – Earnings Per Share  
  
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding after taking into account the dilution effect of stock options using the treasury stock method and any gain (loss) on the redemption of preferred 
shares.

(1)  For the year ended October 31, 2018, the calculation of the diluted earnings per share excluded an average number of 1,621,740 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price 
of $64.14, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average price of the Bank’s common shares. For the year ended October 31, 2017, as the exercise price of the options 
was lower than the average price of the Bank’s common shares, no option was excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.  
 
  
Note 27 – Guarantees, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  
Guarantees 
 
The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the maximum risk of loss if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without 
consideration of recoveries under recourse provisions, insurance policies or from collateral held or pledged. The maximum potential amount of future 
payments for significant guarantees issued by the Bank is presented in the following table. 
  
As at October 31    2018   2017  
         
Letters of guarantee(1)    4,353 3,847  
Backstop liquidity, credit enhancement facilities and other(1)    4,878 5,049  
Securities lending    227 1,293  
 
(1)  For additional information on allowances for credit losses related to off-balance-sheet commitments, refer to Note 8 to these consolidated financial statements. 
 
Letters of Guarantee 
In the normal course of business, the Bank issues letters of guarantee. These letters of guarantee represent irrevocable commitments that the Bank will make 
payments in the event that a client cannot meet its financial obligations to third parties. The Bank’s policy for requiring collateral security with respect to 
letters of guarantee is similar to that for loans. Generally, the term of these letters of guarantee is less than two years. 
 
Backstop Liquidity and Credit Enhancement Facilities 
Facilities to Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing asset-backed commercial paper. 
The Bank provides backstop liquidity facilities to these multi-seller conduits. As at October 31, 2018, the notional amount of the global-style backstop liquidity 
facilities totalled $2.6 billion ($2.7 billion as at October 31, 2017), representing the total amount of the commercial paper outstanding. 
 
These backstop liquidity facilities can be drawn if the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market, even if there is no general market 
disruption. These facilities have terms of less than one year and can be periodically renewed. The terms and conditions of these backstop liquidity facilities do 
not require the Bank to advance money to the conduits if the conduits are insolvent or involved in bankruptcy proceedings or to fund non-performing assets 
beyond the amount of the available credit enhancements. The backstop liquidity facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn to date.

Note 27 – Guarantees, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (cont.) 
 
The Bank also provides credit enhancement facilities to these multi-seller conduits. These facilities have terms of less than one year and are automatically 
renewable unless the Bank sends a non-renewal notice. As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, the committed notional value for these facilities was $30 million. To 
date, the credit enhancement facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn. 
 
The maximum risk of loss for the Bank cannot exceed the total amount of commercial paper outstanding, i.e., $2.6 billion as at October 31, 2018 ($2.7 billion 
as at October 31, 2017). As at October 31, 2018, the Bank held $7 million ($6 million as at October 31, 2017) of this commercial paper and, consequently, the 
maximum potential amount of future payments was $2.6 billion ($2.7 billion as at October 31, 2017). 
 
CDCC Overnight Liquidity Facility 
Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC) acts as a central clearing counterparty for multiple financial instrument transactions in Canada. Certain 
fixed-income clearing members of CDCC have provided an equally shared committed and uncommitted global overnight liquidity facility for the purpose of 
supporting CDCC in its clearing activities of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements or sold under repurchase agreements. The objective of 
this facility is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event of a clearing member’s default. As a fixed-income clearing member providing support to CDCC, the 
Bank provides a liquidity facility. As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of the overnight uncommitted liquidity facility amounted to 
$2.3 billion. As at October 31, 2018 and 2017, no amount had been drawn.

been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to potential indemnities resulting from securities lending agreements. 
  
Other Indemnification Agreements 
In the normal course of business, including securitization transactions and discontinuances of businesses and operations, the Bank enters into numerous 
contractual agreements under which it undertakes to compensate the counterparty for costs incurred as a result of litigation, changes in laws and regulations 
(including tax legislation), claims with respect to past performance, incorrect representations or the non-performance of certain restrictive covenants. The Bank 
also undertakes to indemnify any person acting as a director or officer or performing a similar function within the Bank or one of its subsidiaries or another 
entity, at the request of the Bank, for all expenses incurred by that person in proceedings or investigations to which he or she is party in that capacity. 
Moreover, as a member of a securities transfer network and pursuant to the membership agreement and the regulations governing the operation of the 
network, the Bank granted collateral in favour of the Bank of Canada to guarantee any obligation of the Bank towards the Bank of Canada that could result from 
the Bank’s participation in the securities transfer network. The durations of the indemnification agreements vary according to circumstance; as at October 31, 
2018 and 2017, given the nature of the agreements, the Bank is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential liability it could be required 
to pay to counterparties. No amount has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to these agreements. 
 
Commitments 
 
Credit Instruments 
6 In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the financing needs of its 
1
clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn. 
  
As at October 31    2018  2017

Commitments to extend credit(3)    57,794 52,391  
 
(1)  See the Letters of Guarantee heading on page 195. 
(2)  Documentary letters of credit are documents issued by the Bank and used in international trade to enable a third party to draw drafts on the Bank up to an amount established under specific 
terms and conditions; these instruments are collateralized by the delivery of the goods to which they are related. 
(3)  Credit card receivables and commitments to extend credit represent the undrawn portions of credit authorizations granted in the form of loans, acceptances, letters of guarantee and 
documentary letters of credit. The Bank is required at all times to make the undrawn portion of the credit authorization available, subject to certain conditions. 
 
Financial Assets Received as Collateral 
As at October 31, 2018, the fair value of financial assets received as collateral that the Bank was authorized to sell or repledge was $57.5 billion ($58.3 billion 
as at October 31, 2017). These financial assets received as collateral consist of securities related to securities financing and derivative transactions as well as

Other Commitments  
The Bank acts as an investor in investment banking activities where it enters into agreements to finance external private equity funds and investments in 
equity and debt securities at market value at the time the agreements are signed. In connection with these activities, the Bank has commitments to invest up to 
$99 million as at October 31, 2018 ($77 million as at October 31, 2017).   
  
Pledged Assets 
In the normal course of business, the Bank pledges securities and other assets as collateral. A breakdown of encumbered assets pledged as collateral is

Contingent Liabilities 
 
Litigation 
In the normal course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating, among other matters, to loan portfolios, investment 
portfolios and supplier agreements, including court proceedings, investigations or claims of a regulatory nature, class actions or other legal remedies of varied 
natures.  
 
More specifically, the Bank is involved as a defendant in class actions instituted by consumers contesting, inter alia, certain transaction fees or who wish to 
avail themselves of certain legislative provisions relating to consumer protection. The recent developments in the main legal proceeding involving the Bank are 
as follows: 
  
Watson 
In 2011, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa Corporation Canada (Visa) and MasterCard International Incorporated 
(MasterCard) (the Networks) as well as National Bank and a number of other Canadian financial institutions. A similar action was also initiated in Quebec, 
Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan. In each of the actions, the Networks and financial institutions are alleged to have been involved in a price-fixing system to 
maintain and increase the fees paid by merchants on transactions executed using the credit cards of the Networks. In so doing, they would notably be in 
breach of the Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. In 2017, a settlement was reached with the 
plaintiffs; in 2018 it was then approved by the trial courts in each of the five jurisdictions where the action was initiated. The rulings approving the settlement 
are now the subject of appeal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. 
 
It is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based 
on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a 
material impact on the Bank’s consolidated operating income for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank’s consolidated 
financial position.

Note 28 – Structured Entities 
  
A structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant 
factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means 
of contractual arrangements. Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting treatment described in Note 1. The Bank’s 
maximum exposure to loss resulting from its interests in these structured entities consists primarily of the investments in these entities, the fair value of 
derivative financial instrument contracts entered into with them, and the backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities granted to certain structured 
entities.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities, including commercial loans, reverse 
repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the 
counterparty credit risk of the structured entities, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither 
power nor significant variable returns resulting from financing transactions with structured entities and does not consolidate such entities. Financing 
transactions with third-party-sponsored structured entities are included in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and are not included in the table 
accompanying this note. 
 
Non-Consolidated Structured Entities  
Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the 
assets acquired. Clients use these multi-seller conduits to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial 
assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The 
Bank acts as a financial agent and provides these conduits with administrative and transaction structuring services as well as backstop liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Note 27. The Bank has concluded derivative 
financial instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the Bank has the 
ability to direct the relevant activities of these conduits, it cannot use its power to affect the amount of the returns it obtains, as it acts as an agent. 
Consequently, the Bank does not control these conduits and does not consolidate them.   
 
Investment Funds 
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in 
certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. In addition, the Bank is sponsor and investment manager of mutual funds in which it has 
insignificant or no interest. The Bank does not control the funds where its holdings are not significant as in these circumstances, the Bank either acts only as 
an agent or does not have any power over the relevant activities. In both cases, it does not have significant exposure to the variable returns of the funds.  
Therefore, the Bank does not consolidate these funds. 
 
Private Investments 
As part of its investment banking operations, the Bank invests in several limited liability partnerships and other incorporated entities. These investment 
companies in turn invest in operating companies with a view to reselling these investments at a profit over the medium or long term. The Bank does not 
intervene in the operations of these entities; its only role is that of an investor. Consequently, it does not control these companies and does not consolidate 
them.   
 
Asset-Backed Structured Entities 
The Bank invested in certain asset-backed structured entities. The underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans and 
leases. The Bank does not have the ability to direct the relevant activities of these structured entities and has no exposure to their variable returns, other than 
the right to receive interest income and dividend income from its investments. Consequently, the Bank does not control these structured entities and does not 
consolidate them.

(1)  The main underlying assets, located in Canada, are residential mortgages, automobile loans, automobile inventory financings, and other receivables. As at October 31, 2018, the notional 
committed amount of the global-style liquidity facilities totalled $2.6 billion ($2.7 billion as at October 31, 2017), representing the total amount of commercial paper outstanding. The Bank 
also provides series-wide credit enhancement facilities for a notional committed amount of $30 million ($30 million as at October 31, 2017). The maximum exposure to loss cannot exceed 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding. As at October 31, 2018, the Bank held $7 million in commercial paper ($6 million as at October 31, 2017) and, consequently, the maximum 
potential amount of future payments as at October 31, 2018 is limited to $2.6 billion ($2.7 billion as at October 31, 2017), which represents the undrawn liquidity and credit enhancement 
facilities. 
(2)  The underlying assets are various financial instruments and are presented on a net asset basis. Certain investment funds are in a trading portfolio. 
(3)  The underlying assets are private investments. The amount of total assets of the structured entities corresponds to the amount for the most recent available period. 
(4)  The underlying assets are residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans and leases. 
 
Consolidated Structured Entities 
Securitization Entity for the Bank’s Credit Card Receivables 
In April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its credit card securitization program on a revolving basis and to use the entity 
for capital management and funding purposes.  
 
The Bank provides first-loss protection against the losses since it retains the excess spread from the portfolio of sold receivables. The excess spread 
represents the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid. The Bank also provides second-loss protection as it 
holds subordinated notes issued by CCCT II. In addition, the Bank acts as an administrative agent and servicer and as such is responsible for the daily 
administration and management of CCCT II’s credit card receivables. The Bank therefore has the ability to direct the relevant activities of CCCT II and can 
exercise its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls CCCT II and consolidates it. 
 
Investment Funds  
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in 
certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. The Bank controls the relevant activities of these funds through its involvement as an investor and 
its significant exposure to their variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates these funds.

Note 28 – Structured Entities (cont.) 
 
Covered Bonds 
NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership 
In December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond 
Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold 
uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. The Bank acts as manager of the partnership 
and has decision-making authority over its relevant activities in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program.  In 
addition, the Bank is able, in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program, to affect the variable returns of the 
partnership, which are directly related to the return on the mortgage loan portfolio and the interest on the loans from the Bank. Consequently, the Bank 
controls the partnership and consolidates it. 
 
NBC Asset Trust 
The Bank created NBC Asset Trust for its funding and capital management needs. The securities issued by this trust constitute innovative capital instruments 
and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do not satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be 
phased out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022. For additional information, see Note 20 to these consolidated financial statements. The issuance 
proceeds were used to acquire, from the Bank, residential mortgage loans. The Bank continues to administer these loans and is committed to repurchase from 
NBC Asset Trust the capital balance and unpaid accrued interest on any loan that is more than 90 days past due. The Bank also manages day-to-day operations 
and holds the special voting securities of the trust. After the distribution has been paid to the holders of the trust capital securities, the Bank, as the sole 
holder of the special trust securities, is entitled to receive the balance of net residual funds. Therefore, the Bank has the ability to direct the relevant activities 
of NBC Asset Trust and can use its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls this trust and consolidates it. 
 
Third-Party Structured Entities 
In 2015, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, acquired interests in portions of a third-party structured entity. Each portion of the structured entity is a 
deemed separate entity since all of the following criteria are met: 1) specified assets of the entity are the only source of payment for specified liabilities of (or 
specified other interests in) the entity; 2) parties other than those with the specified liabilities do not have rights or obligations related to the specified assets 
or to residual cash flows from those assets. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the deemed separate entities, as it has the ability to direct their 
relevant activities through its kick-out rights over the servicer of their assets and because it is also exposed to the variability of their returns. 
 
In 2018, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, provided financing to a third-party structured entity in exchange for a 100% interest in a loan portfolio, the 
sole asset held by that entity. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the structured entity, as it has the ability to direct the entity’s relevant activities 
through its involvement in the decision-making process. The Bank is also exposed to the entity’s variable returns. 
 
The following table presents the Bank’s investments and other assets in the consolidated structured entities as well as the total assets of these entities.

Note 30 – Management of the Risks Associated With Financial Instruments 
  
The Bank is exposed to credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and financing risk. The Bank’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing risk and the risk 
measurement methods are presented in the Risk Management section of the MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2018. Text in grey shading and tables 
identified with an asterisk (*) in the Risk Management section of the MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2018 are an integral part of these consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
Residual Contractual Maturities of Balance Sheet Items and  
Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments 
 
The following tables present balance sheet items and off-balance-sheet commitments by residual contractual maturity as at October 31, 2018 and 2017. The 
information gathered from this maturity analysis is a component of liquidity and funding management. However, this maturity profile does not represent how 
the Bank manages its interest rate risk nor its liquidity risk and funding needs. The Bank considers factors other than contractual maturity in the assessment of 
liquid assets or in determining expected future cash flows.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the funding needs of its 
clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn.  
 
The Bank also has future minimum commitments under leases for premises as well for other contracts, mainly contracts for outsourced information technology 
services. Most of the lease commitments are related to operating leases.

Note 31 – Segment Disclosures 
  
The Bank carries out its activities in four business segments, which are defined below. For presentation purposes, other activities are grouped in the Other 
heading. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele and marketing strategy. 
 
Personal and Commercial  
The Personal and Commercial segment encompasses the banking, financing, and investing services offered to individuals and businesses as well as insurance 
operations. 
 
Wealth Management 
The Wealth Management segment comprises investment solutions, trust services, banking services, lending services and other wealth management solutions 
offered through internal and third-party distribution networks. 
 
Financial Markets 
The Financial Markets segment encompasses corporate banking and investment banking and financial solutions for large and mid-size corporations, public 
sector organizations, and institutional investors. The segment is also active in proprietary trading and investment activities for the Bank.

This heading encompasses Treasury activities, including the Bank’s asset and liability management, liquidity management and funding operations, certain 
non-recurring items and the unallocated portion of corporate services. 
 
The segment disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements, 
except for the net interest income, non-interest income and income taxes (recovery) of the operating segments, which are presented on a taxable equivalent 
basis. Taxable equivalent basis is a calculation method that consists in grossing up certain tax-exempt income by the amount of income tax that would have 
otherwise been payable. The effect of these adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. Operations support charges are allocated to each operating 
segment presented in the business segment results. The Bank assesses performance based on the net income attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. 
Intersegment revenues are recognized at the exchange amount. Segment assets correspond to average assets used in segment operations.

(1)  For the year ended October 31, 2017, certain amounts have been reclassified, particularly in the USSF&I segment, where an amount of $204 million reported in Non-interest income was 
reclassified to Net interest income. 
(2)  For the year ended October 31, 2018, Net interest income was grossed up by $144 million ($209 million in 2017), Non-interest income was grossed up by $101 million ($35 million in 2017), 
and an equivalent amount was recognized in Income taxes (recovery). The effect of these adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. 
(3)  Given the adoption of IFRS 9 on November 1, 2017, the Bank accounts for all provisions for credit losses within the business segments. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, only 
provisions for credit losses on impaired loans had been recognized in the business segments, whereas provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans had been recognized in the Other 
heading. During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank had reversed, by $40 million, the sectoral provision on non-impaired loans recorded for the oil and gas producer and service 
company loan portfolio presented in the Personal and Commercial segment, and the $40 million in provisions for credit losses in the Other heading had reflected an increase in the collective 
allowance for credit risk on non-impaired loans.

(2)  Certain amounts have been reclassified; in particular, a Purchased receivables amount of $2,014 million, which had been classified in Other assets in this table as at October 31, 2017, is 
now reported in Loans and acceptances (2016: $1,858 million; 2015: $1,438 million; 2014: $790 million). Figures as at October 31, 2013 and previous years were not adjusted to reflect 
those modifications. 
(3)  Given the adoption of IFRS 9, all loans classified in Stage 3 of the expected credit loss model are impaired loans. POCI loans have been excluded. Under IAS 39, loans were considered 
impaired according to different criteria. Net impaired loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on Stage 3 loan amounts drawn. 
(4)  Includes customers’ liability under acceptances.  
(5)  The figures for fiscal years 2014 to 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain amounts between the Non-interest income and the Net interest income items to reflect 
the change in the presentation of certain Consolidated Balance Sheet items; in particular, the Purchased receivables item, which had been classified in Other assets as at October 31, 2017, 
is now reported in Loans.
