RISK DISCLOSURES 
 
In May 2012, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) formed a working group, the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF), that was mandated to develop principles 
for enhancing the risk disclosures of major banks, to recommend improvements to current risk disclosures, and to identify risk disclosure best practices used 
by major financial institutions. On October 29, 2012, the EDTF published a report entitled Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks, which contains 
32 recommendations. The Bank makes every effort to ensure overall compliance with those recommendations and is continuing to enhance its risk disclosures 
to meet the best practices on an ongoing basis. The risk disclosures required by the EDTF are provided in this Annual Report and in the document entitled

MANAGEMENT ’S DISCUSSION
  
AND  ANALYSIS
 
 
 
 
November 30, 2017 
 
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) presents the financial condition and operating results of National Bank of Canada (the Bank). 
This analysis was prepared in accordance with the requirements set out in National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations, released by the 
Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). It is based on the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2017 (the consolidated 
financial statements) and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), unless otherwise indicated. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This MD&A should be read in conjunction 
with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended October 31, 2017. All amounts are presented in Canadian dollars. 
Additional information about the Bank, including the Annual Information Form, can be obtained from the Bank’s website at nbc.ca and SEDAR’s website at

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
From time to time, the Bank makes written and oral forward-looking statements, such as those contained in the Outlook for National Bank and the Major Economic Trends sections of 
this Annual Report, in other filings with Canadian securities regulators, and in other communications, for the purpose of describing the economic environment in which the Bank will 
operate during fiscal 2018 and the objectives it hopes to achieve for that period. These forward-looking statements are made in accordance with current securities legislation in 
Canada and the United States. They include, among others, statements with respect to the economy—particularly the Canadian and U.S. economies—market changes, observations 
regarding the Bank’s objectives and its strategies for achieving them, Bank-projected financial returns and certain risks faced by the Bank. These forward-looking statements are 
typically identified by future or conditional verbs or words such as “outlook,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar terms and 
expressions. 
By their very nature, such forward-looking statements require assumptions to be made and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific. Assumptions 
about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2018 and how that will affect the Bank’s business are among the main factors considered in setting the Bank’s 
strategic priorities and objectives and in determining its financial targets, including provisions for credit losses. In determining its expectations for economic growth, both broadly 
and in the financial services sector in particular, the Bank primarily considers historical economic data provided by the Canadian and U.S. governments and their agencies. 
There is a strong possibility that express or implied projections contained in these forward-looking statements will not materialize or will not be accurate. The Bank 
recommends that readers not place undue reliance on these statements, as a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control, could cause actual future results, 
conditions, actions or events to differ significantly from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include credit 
risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk and environmental risk, all of which are described in more 
detail in the Risk Management section beginning on page 51 of this Annual Report; general economic environment and financial market conditions in Canada, the United States and 
certain other countries in which the Bank conducts business, including regulatory changes affecting the Bank’s business, capital and liquidity; changes in the accounting policies the 
Bank uses to report its financial condition, including uncertainties associated with assumptions and critical accounting estimates; tax laws in the countries in which the Bank 
operates, primarily Canada and the United States (including the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)); changes to capital and liquidity guidelines and to the manner in 
which they are to be presented and interpreted; changes to the credit ratings assigned to the Bank; and potential disruptions to the Bank’s information technology systems, 
including evolving cyber attack risk. 
The foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these factors can be found in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report. Investors and 
others who rely on the Bank’s forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Except as 
required by law, the Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, by it or on its behalf. 
The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of interpreting the information contained herein and may not be appropriate for other 
purposes. 
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
   
 
  
FINANCIAL REPORTING METHOD 
  
The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2016. This 
presentation reflects the fact that the activities of subsidiary Credigy Ltd. (Credigy), which had previously been presented in the Financial Markets segment, 
and that the activities of subsidiary Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank) and of other international investments, which had previously been presented in 
the Other heading, are now presented in the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. The Bank made this change to better align the 
monitoring of its activities with its management structure. 
 
The Bank has adjusted certain specified items to make the data from fiscal years 2017 and 2016 comparable. These adjustments are presented in the table 
below.

(1)  On November 1, 2016, the Bank reclassified certain amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Income to better reflect the nature of the income presented in the Personal and Commercial 
segment. As a result, for the year ended October 31, 2016, an amount of $36 million reported in Non-interest income was reclassified to Net interest income. This reclassification had no 
impact on Net income. 
(2)  The Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate net interest income, non-interest income and income taxes. This calculation method consists of grossing up certain tax-exempt 
income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. An equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform 
a uniform comparison of the return on different assets regardless of their tax treatment. 
(3)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank had recorded $9 million in financing costs ($6 million net of income taxes) related to holding restructured notes.

(4)  During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank recorded an amount of $9 million ($7 million net of income taxes) for its share in the integration costs incurred by Fiera Capital 
Corporation (Fiera Capital) and an amount of $2 million ($2 million net of income taxes) for its share in the integration costs arising from its equity interest in TMX Group Limited (TMX). For 
the year ended October 31, 2016, the total amount of these costs had been $31 million ($24 million net of income taxes) and notably included the Bank’s share in goodwill and intangible 
asset impairment losses related to its equity interest in TMX for an amount of $18 million ($13 million net of income taxes).  
(5)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank had written off its equity interest in associate Maple Financial Group Inc. (Maple) in an amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income 
taxes) following the February 6, 2016 event described in the Analysis of the Consolidated Balance Sheet section on page 38 of this MD&A. 
(6)  During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank recorded $19 million in charges ($16 million net of income taxes) related to the Wealth Management acquisitions (2016: $22 million, 
$18 million net of income taxes). These charges consisted mostly of retention bonuses and the amortization of intangible assets. 
(7)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank had recorded a restructuring charge of $131 million ($96 million net of income taxes). This charge consisted mostly of severance pay. 
(8)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank had recorded $44 million ($32 million net of income taxes) in intangible asset impairment losses on internally developed software. 
(9)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank had recorded $25 million in litigation charges ($18 million net of income taxes) related to resolving litigation and other disputes arising 
from claims, both ongoing and potential, made against the Bank. 
(10)  During the year ended October 31, 2016, an $18 million tax provision had been recorded to reflect the impact of substantively enacted changes to tax measures. 
(11)  For the year ended October 31, 2016, the specified items had included a premium of $3 million, or $0.01 per share, on the redemption of the Series 20 preferred shares for cancellation. 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Like many other financial institutions, the Bank uses the taxable

the results of the reported periods, and allows readers to assess results 
without the specified items if they consider such items not to be reflective of 
the underlying performance of the Bank’s operations. Securities regulators 
require companies to caution readers that non-GAAP measures do not have a 
standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to 
similar measures used by other companies. 
In addition to the specified items, in fiscal 2016 the Bank had recorded 
a sectoral provision of $250 million ($183 million net of income taxes) on 
non-impaired  loans  in  the oil  and  gas  producer  and service  company 
portfolio, reporting it in the Personal and Commercial segment. During fiscal 
2017, the Bank reversed this sectoral provision by $40 million ($29 million 
net  of  income  taxes).  Given  the  materiality  of  the  sectoral  provision 
recognized and presented in accordance with GAAP, it has been excluded 
from certain analyses in this MD&A.

designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated 
to the Bank’s management, including its signing officers, as appropriate, to 
allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
This Annual Report was reviewed by the Disclosure Committee, the 
Audit Committee, and the Bank’s Board of Directors (the Board), which 
approved it prior to publication. 
 
Internal Controls Over  
Financial Reporting 
 
The internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and 
that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with 
GAAP, which are based on IFRS, unless indicated otherwise as explained on 
page 10 of this MD&A. Due to inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or 
detect all misstatements in a timely manner. 
The CEO and the CFO oversaw the evaluation work performed on the 
design  and  operation  of  the  Bank’s  ICFR  in  accordance  with 
Regulation 52-109. These controls were evaluated in accordance with the

Based on the evaluation results, the CEO and CFO concluded, as at

effective and provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is 
reliable,  and  that  the  Bank’s  consolidated  financial  statements  were 
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

High Quality Loan Portfolio  Breakdown of the Average Loan and Acceptance Portfolio(1) 
As at October 31, 2017 
 
For fiscal 2017, the Bank recorded $244 million in provisions for credit 
losses, $240 million less than the provisions recorded for fiscal 2016. 
Essentially, the lower credit loss provisions are related to the sectoral  25%
provision on non-impaired loans recorded for the oil and gas producer and 
service company loan portfolio, which was reversed by $40 million in fiscal 
2017 compared to the $250 million recording of this provision in fiscal 2016. 
Also, at $43 million, the provisions for credit losses on Commercial Banking 
8%
loans were down $30 million in fiscal 2017. Both of these decreases were 
partly offset by a $40 million increase in the collective allowance for credit 
risk on non-impaired loans recorded to reflect growth in the Bank’s overall 
credit portfolio and by a $44 million increase in the provisions for credit 
10%
losses recorded for loans in the U.S. Specialty Finance and International 
segment and that is essentially attributable to the Credigy subsidiary. The 
2017 provisions for credit losses on impaired loans represented 0.19% of 
5%
average loans and acceptances, unchanged from fiscal 2016. In addition,  52%
impaired loans, net of total allowances, were down $50 million compared to 
last  year  given  a  decline  in  net  impaired  loans  in  the  personal  and 
commercial loan portfolios and a $40 million increase in the collective 
allowance on non-impaired loans, offset by a lower sectoral allowance on 
non-impaired loans.

Outlook for National Bank  Geographic Distribution of Total Revenues 
Year ended October 31, 2017  
 
An  essential  component  of  the Bank’s  strategy  is  to  ensure  business  (taxable equivalent basis)(1) 
diversification by supporting growth in its four business segments—Personal 
and Commercial, Wealth Management, Financial Markets, and U.S. Specialty

organic growth, the Wealth Management and Financial Markets segments 
have expanded through the years and now generate close to half of the

revenue  and  earnings  growth.  As  for  the  U.S.  Specialty  Finance  and 
International segment, it is experiencing substantial revenue and net income

growth. 
While prioritizing growth in its four main business segments, the Bank  59%
also focuses on expanding its presence across Canada while continuing to 
maintain its leadership position in Quebec. The Financial Markets segment is 
well-positioned nationally and derives most of its revenues outside Quebec. 
The Wealth Management segment has established a national presence 
through its investment advisor channel, its business relationships with 
independent  advisors,  and  its  partnerships  and  now  enjoys  a  wide 
distribution reach and consistent revenue growth outside Quebec. The   
Personal and Commercial segment is largely based in central Canada and  Quebec (2016: 60%)

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
OVERVIEW   
 
  
Major Economic Trends Quebec’s economy should expand by 2.0% in 2018, following 2.5% this 
 
year. This significantly exceeds its potential growth rate estimated at 1.0%.

rate of 3.7% in 2018 (3.6% in 2017). However, many unknowns loom over   
the geopolitical situation, notably developments in North Korea and Iran. The   
rise in commercial protectionism is also a preoccupying phenomenon on the   
horizon for 2018.    
   
United States   
The U.S. economy remains on track to grow roughly 2.2% in 2017 thanks in   
part to strong performances in the second and third quarters. Reconstruction   
efforts to address hurricane-related damage will help drive growth in the   
fourth quarter. The solid labour market is fueling consumer confidence and   
hence spending. And assuming the debt-ceiling is raised come December   
and fiscal stimulus is deployed ahead of mid-term congressional elections,   
another year of above-potential growth can be expected in 2018 (2.4%).   
As  such,  the  Bank  believes  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserve  will  tighten   
monetary policy by raising rates in December and twice in 2018.   
   
Canada   
Canada’s economy remains on track to grow about 3.0% in 2017, well above   
the consensus expectations among economists at the beginning of the year.   
Consumption spending has been the major driver of growth this year,   
benefiting from a confluence of favourable developments, including the best   
labour market in years, family benefits, low interest rates, and the wealth   
effects associated with surging home prices. If the Bank is correctly gauging   
 
upcoming fiscal stimulus in a pre-electoral context in Quebec, Ontario and 
possibly British Columbia, 2018 growth will also be strong at 2.5%. So, while 
the Bank of Canada does not seem inclined to raise rates soon, strong data 
may  eventually  force  its  hand  early  next  year.  A  less  accommodative 
monetary policy combined with tighter mortgage requirements should cool 
the residential real estate market, especially in Vancouver and Toronto. The 
Montreal market is less vulnerable in this respect since housing affordability 
remains reasonable.

Provisions for Credit Losses 
For fiscal 2017, the Bank recorded $244 million in provisions for credit 
losses, $240 million less than the provisions recorded for fiscal 2016 
(Table 6, page 100). Essentially, the lower credit loss provisions are related 
to the sectoral provision on non-impaired loans recorded for the oil and gas 
producer  and  service  company  loan  portfolio,  which  was  reversed  by 
$40 million in fiscal 2017 compared to the $250 million recording of this 
sectoral provision in fiscal 2016. Also, at $43 million, the provisions for 
credit losses on Commercial Banking loans were down $30 million in fiscal 
2017. Both of these decreases were partly offset by a $40 million increase in 
the collective allowance for credit risk on non-impaired loans, which was 
recorded to reflect growth in the Bank’s overall credit portfolio, and by a 
$44 million increase in the provisions for credit losses recorded for loans in 
the U.S. Specialty Finance and International segment that is essentially 
attributable to the Credigy subsidiary. The 2017 provisions for credit losses 
on impaired loans represented 0.19% of average loans and acceptances, 
unchanged from fiscal 2016.

Economic and Market Review 
 
In 2017, the Canadian economy grew steadily. Consumer spending was the main engine of growth, thanks to a convergence of several favourable factors such 
as the best labour market performance in years, low interest rates, and the wealth effects associated with rising residential real estate prices. For 2018, growth 
is expected to be equally steady, although it is important to remember the increased sensitivity of homeowners in certain major urban centres to potential 
interest rate increases.

net of income taxes) on non-impaired loans recorded for the oil and gas producer and service company loan portfolio. Given the materiality of this sectoral provision, recorded in accordance 
with GAAP, net income excluding the impact of the sectoral provision has been presented to provide a better assessment of the segment’s results. See the Financial Reporting Method 
section on page 10 for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.

Year ended October 31, 2017 
 
 
In the Personal and Commercial segment, net income totalled $925 million in 
fiscal 2017, up 66% from $557 million in 2016. This change is mainly related 
to the sectoral provision on non-impaired loans for the oil and gas producer  13%
and service company loan portfolio, which was reversed by $29 million, net  4%
of income taxes, in 2017 compared to the $183 million, net of income taxes, 
recording of this provision in 2016. Net income excluding the impact of the 
sectoral provision totalled $896 million in 2017, up 21% year over year. The 
segment’s total revenues rose $161 million or 6% year over year, as net 
interest  income  grew  $116 million  while  non-interest  income  was  up 
$45 million. The higher net interest income came primarily from growth in  36%
personal and commercial loan and deposit volumes and from a higher net 
interest margin, which was 2.26% in 2017 versus 2.24% in 2016.  
The segment’s 2017 non-interest expenses stood at $1,646 million, a  47%
1% year-over-year decrease resulting mainly from lower compensation and 
employee benefits (related to the transformation plan adopted by the Bank to 
improve operational efficiency) as well as from lower communications costs 
and operations support charges. These decreases were partly offset by 
higher technology expenses related to business development. Given these 
 
results, the segment’s 2017 contribution increased 14% year over year.

BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS | Wealth Management 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
The Wealth Management segment believes that the strength of client relationships is—and will remain—the key factor in its success. Therefore, this segment 
focuses on hiring and retaining advisors and support staff with a passion for providing outstanding client experience and on providing category-leading 
products and services. 
 
Wealth Management leverages internal and third-party distribution channels as well as its product manufacturers to maintain leadership in Quebec and to 
continue growing its market share across Canada. The segment is differentiated by its unique business model and a culture that features a high degree of 
professionalism. 
 
 
Economic and Market Review 
 
Global economic expansion continued to advance during the year, as industrial production grew rapidly. The rise in various indicators bolstered investor 
confidence, which partly explains why the market index calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI World) peaked. The S&P/TSX Index also 
staged a strong comeback at the end of the year. In this context, there was strong growth in revenues, particularly from fee-based services, in accordance with 
the business strategies put in place. For 2018, the role of advisory services will make it possible to anticipate continued business growth based on various 
scenarios for potential market changes.

BUSINESS SEGMENT ANALYSIS | Financial Markets

The Financial Markets segment offers a full suite of financial solutions, from debt and equity underwriting to bank credit and risk management products. This 
segment also delivers comprehensive advisory services in the areas of mergers and acquisitions and financing. Access to the Canadian capital markets is 
provided through its fixed-income, equities and derivatives business lines. The segment’s clients consist of large and mid-sized corporations, public sector 
clients and institutions across Canada.  
 
Financial Markets is an investment banking leader across Canada and the overall top-ranked franchise in Quebec. In fixed-income and equities, it is a market 
leader, providing origination, underwriting, distribution, and liquidity through secondary market activities as well as macroeconomic and issuer-focused

States, Europe and Asia. Through its Dublin subsidiary, it engages in trading activities with large European-based institutions in local equity and equity-linked 
securities exchanges.  
 
 
Economic and Market Review 
 
The fiscal 2017 environment was conducive to strong capital markets results, with trading revenue supported by volatility and the rising markets in the U.S. 
following the presidential election. As volatility decreased in the second half, there was a pick-up in underwriting and advisory revenues and strong M&A 
volumes.

Economic and Market Review 
 
The U.S. consumer finance industry sustained a strong growth trajectory in 2017, fueled by a rebounding U.S. economy. Increases in consumer and investment 
spending resulted in real GDP growth. In response to the strengthening economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve gradually raised interest rates during the year. 
 
Cambodia’s GDP continued to grow rapidly in 2017. The country continues to benefit from its membership in the dynamic Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) trade association, low oil prices, growth of the tourism industry and expansionary fiscal policy.

In the U.S. Speciality Finance and International segment, net income totalled 
$184 million for the year ended October 31, 2017 compared to $147 million 
23% 1%
in fiscal 2016. The segment’s 2017 total revenues amounted to $541 million 
versus $411 million in fiscal 2016; this revenue growth was driven partly by 
a 26% increase in Credigy’s revenues, particularly due to growth in loan 
volumes,  and  partly  by  the  revenues  from  the  ABA  Bank  subsidiary, 
consolidated into the Bank’s results since the third quarter of 2016, which 
increased  steadily  due  to  growth  in  loan  and  deposit  volumes.  These 
increases more than made up for the fiscal 2016 recognition of a $41 million 
non-taxable gain realized on the revaluation of the previously held equity 
interest in ABA Bank. 
For  the  year  ended  October 31, 2017,  the  segment’s  non-interest 
expenses stood at $225 million, an $18 million year-over-year increase 
attributable essentially to all of the non-interest expenses of the ABA Bank 
subsidiary, which have been consolidated into the Bank’s results since the 
third quarter of 2016. As for the non-interest expenses of the Credigy  76%
subsidiary, they were down 10% year over year, primarily as a result of lower 
 
servicing fees.   
Credigy (2016: 79%) 
For fiscal 2017, the segment’s provisions for credit losses stood at

Maple Bank GmbH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Maple, has   
been the subject of an investigation into alleged tax irregularities by German 
prosecutors since September 2015 and, to the Bank’s knowledge, that 
investigation is ongoing. The Bank understands that the investigation is 
focusing on selected trading activities by Maple Bank GmbH and some of its 
current and former employees during taxation years 2006 to 2010, although 
the Bank has been advised that the investigation may also extend to 
subsequent taxation years. The German authorities have alleged that these 
trading  activities  violated  German  tax  laws.  Neither  the  Bank  nor  its 
employees were involved in these trading activities and, to the Bank’s 
knowledge, are not the subject of this investigation. 
On  February  6,  2016,  the  German  Federal  Financial  Supervisory 
Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple 
Bank GmbH, preventing it from carrying out its normal business activities. In 
light of the situation, the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity 
interest in Maple in an amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income 
taxes) during the first quarter of 2016. The $164 million write-off of the 
equity interest in this associate was recognized in the Non-interest income – 
Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended 
October 31, 2016 and was reported in the Financial Markets segment. 
The Bank has advised the German authorities that if it is determined 
that  portions  of  dividends  received  from  Maple  could  be  reasonably 
attributable to tax fraud by Maple Bank GmbH, arrangements will be made to 
repay those amounts to the relevant authority. If any repayments are 
required, they are not expected to be material to the Bank’s financial 
position. 
 
Income Taxes 
  
In March 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issued a proposed 
reassessment  to  the  Bank  for  the  2011  and  2012  taxation  years.  In 
May 2017, the CRA reassessed the Bank for the 2012 taxation year. The 
transactions  to  which  the  proposed  reassessment  and  the  actual 
reassessment relate are similar to those prospectively addressed by the 
synthetic equity arrangement rules introduced in the 2015 Canadian federal 
budget. The proposed reassessment and the actual reassessment (including 
estimated  provincial  income  taxes  and  interest)  total  approximately 
$173 million. The CRA may issue reassessments to the Bank in respect of 
similar activities for fiscal years subsequent to 2012. The Bank is confident 
that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously defend its 
position. As a result, no amount has been recognized in the consolidated 
financial statements as at October 31, 2017.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
The Bank uses various types of derivative financial instruments to meet its

to foreign exchange, interest, and credit rate risk as well as other market 
risks. All derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value on

Credit Instruments 
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-

RISK MANAGEMENT   
 
In this section of the MD&A, grey-shaded text and tables marked with an asterisk (*) are integral parts of the consolidated financial statements. They 
represent the Bank’s objectives, the risk management policies and procedures, and the methods applied to measure credit risk, market risk as well as 
liquidity and funding risk, as required by IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures. 
 
The Bank views risk as an integral part of its development and the diversification of its activities and advocates a risk management approach consistent with 
its business expansion strategy. The purpose of sound risk management is to provide reasonable assurance that incurred risks do not exceed acceptable 
thresholds and that risk-taking contributes to the creation of shareholder value. For the Bank, this means striking a healthy balance between return and risk. 
The Bank is exposed to risk in two ways. First, it voluntarily exposes itself to certain risk categories, particularly credit and market risk, in order to 
generate revenue. Second, it assumes risks that are inherent to its activities—to which it does not choose to expose itself—and that do not generate revenue, 
i.e., mainly operational risk. These risks may result in losses that could adversely affect future earnings. 
 
Top and Emerging Risks 
 
Top and emerging risks are risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial results, reputation or long-term business model and strategy. 
The Bank’s processes are designed to detect and assess these risks as early as possible so that appropriate mitigating strategies can be applied. The Bank’s 
top and emerging risks are as follows. 
 
Risk  Trend  Description 
 
Currently, the main global risks consist of slowing economic growth in certain emerging countries, geopolitical tensions—
in particular the rapid militarization of North Korea—and the adoption of protectionist measures that are undermining 
international trade. The coming into power of the new U.S. administration brings its share of concerns about future 
policies that might affect the Canadian and Quebec economies. Excessive protectionism could adversely affect certain 
industries and slow international trade, negatively affecting our  export clients in turn. Furthermore, the rise of 
Global  nationalism, the waves of migration to western Europe, and geopolitical tensions have also intensified uncertainty in the

risks       In addition, given exceptional monetary measures taken by central banks combined with mild economic growth and low 
inflation, long-term interest rates continue to be historically low in the major advanced economies. Such a situation may 
have prompted market participants to adopt excessive risk-taking strategies in search of higher returns, the negative 
effects of which may be felt if interest rates return to normal faster than expected, particularly in the United States. 
Therefore, the Bank is remaining vigilant and continuing to rely on its strong risk management framework to identify, 
assess and mitigate risk so that it remains within the risk appetite limits. 
 
 
The domestic energy sector struggled in the wake of the global oil supply shock but is gradually adapting to the new 
environment. The fossil fuel-producing provinces are back on track to growth but their unemployment rates remain high. 
Fortunately, stable economic and financial conditions in the three largest provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia) 
continue to support a credit environment that is favourable for the Bank’s loan portfolio. Still, Canada remains vulnerable 
to a deteriorating economic backdrop, which threatens to erode job creation and disposable household income—even

Canada  of risk for the Canadian economy should the central banks continue to reduce monetary stimulus. The Bank maintains 
sound credit practices, but tighter mortgage rules remain an issue for Canadian households. 
     
The Bank also closely monitors international developments that may affect the Canadian economy. The renegotiation 
of agreements such as NAFTA has cast substantial uncertainty over the trade relationship between Canada and the United 
States and other economic partners. These uncertainties have significantly destabilized the industry, and the Bank has 
responded by continuing to monitor market developments and remaining vigilant in line with its risk tolerance policy.

Risk  Trend  Description 
 
Low oil and gas prices have had a direct impact on the energy sector, challenging many energy companies to implement 
a broad range of measures to address the situation. Should oil and gas prices continue to fall or remain depressed for 
an extended period of time, the obstacles to be overcome by these companies will only become more daunting and will

results depends on how long oil prices remain low and how businesses deploy measures to increase efficiency, reduce 
outflows of funds, and sell assets in order to raise capital to cover operating costs. The Bank is actively managing this 
portfolio, and several measures have already been taken with our clients to limit the risk of loss. 
 
 
Technology has become a major part of the banking industry’s operations, in particular the ever-increasing use of 
information technologies such as mobile, wireless and web-enabled devices. Despite the Bank’s efforts to ensure the 
integrity of its systems and information, it is exposed to the risks associated with data breaches, malicious software, 
unauthorized access, hacking, phishing, identity theft, intellectual property theft, asset theft, industrial espionage and 
possible denial of service due to activities causing network failures and service interruptions. It is also possible for the 
Bank to be unable to prevent or implement effective preventive measures against every potential cyber-threat, as the 
tactics used are multiplying, change frequently, come from a wide range of sources and are increasingly sophisticated.

       To protect its clients, the Bank closely monitors and actively manages its control environment. It also monitors the 
changing global environment and continues to improve the processes and practices used to prevent, identify and 
manage cybersecurity threats to ensure continuous effectiveness and protection. The Bank continually assesses the 
effectiveness of key controls through testing, measuring its own practices against best practices, and via external 
benchmarking. The Bank also invests in projects designed to constantly update and improve its information technology 
infrastructure, controls, internal resources and technological capabilities. The Board’s Risk Management Committee is 
regularly informed of cybersecurity trends and developments to gain a better understanding of potential cybersecurity

Risk  Trend  Description 
 
The Bank is reliant on technology, as clients are seeking greater access to products and services on a variety of 
platforms and because many of the products and services require substantial data processing. As such, the Bank’s 
technology platform must be able to manage all such data. The fast pace of technological change combined with both 
client  and  competitive  pressures  require  significant  and  sustained  investment  in  technology.  Unsuccessful 
implementation of technological improvements or new products or services could significantly affect the Bank’s 
ability to serve and retain clients.

       Third-party cloud computing solutions could raise the risks related to data security and breaches if security

procurement processes and suppliers must also continue to evolve so it can appropriately manage the related risks. 
 
 
The Bank’s financial performance depends on its ability to develop and market new and innovative products and 
services, adopt and develop new technologies that help differentiate its products and services and generate cost

Risk Management Framework 
 
Risk is rigorously managed. That means it is identified, measured and controlled to ensure that the Bank’s operations yield an adequate return for the level of 
risk assumed. Managing risk requires a solid understanding of every type of risk found across the Bank. In addition to providing assurance that risk levels do 
not exceed acceptable thresholds, effective risk management can be used to control the volatility of the Bank's results.  
Despite the exercise of stringent risk management and the mitigation measures in place, risk cannot be suppressed entirely, and the residual risks may 
occasionally cause significant losses. In the normal course of business, the Bank is primarily exposed to the risks presented below.

—  fact-based: good risk management relies heavily on common sense and   
judgment and on advanced systems and models. 
 
Risk Appetite and Reporting 
Risk-taking is intrinsic to a financial institution’s business. Business unit 
strategies have always—implicitly or explicitly—incorporated decisions about 
the amount of risk they are willing to assume. Risk appetite represents how 
much risk an organization is willing to assume to achieve its business 
strategy. The Bank cultivates a risk management culture that is aligned with 
its risk appetite, doing so by setting risk tolerance thresholds that determine 
its risk-taking capacity. 
The Bank’s risk appetite framework consists of principles, statements, 
metrics as well as targets and is reinforced by policies and limits. It is 
defined both quantitatively and qualitatively and requires: 
 
—  a target risk rating of at least A+ or the equivalent;  
—  a risk-reward balance; 
—  a stable risk profile; 
—  a strategic level of concentration aligned with approved targets; 
—  a strong capital position; 
—  a strong liquidity position; 
—  a low tolerance to operational and reputation risk; 
—  a rigorous management of regulatory compliance risk; 
—  operational  and  information  systems  stability  in  both  normal 
circumstances and crisis. 
 
The Bank’s management and business units are involved in the process 
for setting the risk appetite and are responsible for adequately monitoring 
the chosen key risk indicators. These needs are assessed by means of the 
enterprise strategic planning process. The risk indicators are reported on a 
regular basis to ensure an effective alignment of the Bank’s risk profile to its 
risk appetite; otherwise, appropriate actions could be taken.

policy presents the main mechanisms used for identifying and measuring the   
types of market risk to which the Bank is exposed, most of which are   
described on the previous page. It also defines the link between the Bank’s 
market risk appetite approved by the Board and the framework implemented 
for setting market risk limits across all the Bank’s business units that are 
allowed to undertake market risk. The purpose of the market risk limits is to 
set out tolerance thresholds for these business units or portfolios to comply 
with the Bank’s market risk appetite targets. These are cascaded down to 
business units using a hierarchy of different types of limits (e.g., Value at 
Risk (VaR), stop loss limit) allocated by portfolio, trading unit, unit manager 
and officer, as well as an appropriate breach escalation process.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) 
The LCR was introduced to ensure banks maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand periods of severe short-term stress. OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks 
to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. An LCR above 100% ensures that banks are holding sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover net cash outflows 
given a severe, 30-day liquidity crisis. The assumptions underlying the LCR scenario were established by the BCBS and OSFI. 
The following table provides average LCR data calculated using the daily figures in the quarter. For the quarter ended October 31, 2017, the Bank’s 
average LCR was 132%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement and demonstrating the Bank’s solid liquidity position.

(1)  OSFI prescribed a table format in order to standardize disclosure throughout the banking industry. 
(2)  Unweighted values are calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows). 
(3)  Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates. 
(4)  Total adjusted values are calculated after the application of both haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and any applicable caps. 
(5)  The data in this table has been calculated using averages of the daily figures in the quarter. 
 
Level 1 liquid assets represent 89% of the Bank’s HQLA, which includes cash, central bank deposits, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the Canadian 
government and Canadian provincial governments. 
Cash outflows arise from the application of OSFI-prescribed assumptions on deposits, debt, secured funding, commitments and additional collateral 
requirements. The cash outflows are partly offset by cash inflows, which come mainly from secured loans and performing loans. The Bank expects some 
quarter-over-quarter variation between reported LCRs, and such variation may not be indicative of a trend. The variation between the quarter ended 
October 31, 2017 and the previous quarter was a result of normal business activities. The Bank’s liquid asset buffer is well in excess of its total net cash 
outflows.  
The LCR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures presented in the tables on the previous pages or those used for 
internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework was prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank’s internal liquidity metrics use 
assumptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.

RISK MANAGEMENT   
 
  
Environmental Risk Management 
 
Environmental risk is the risk of a loss or damage to the Bank’s reputation 
arising from environmental concerns related to the Bank or its clients. 
Environmental risk is often associated with credit risk and operational risk. 
Environmental risk is defined as any impact arising from environmental 
issues (such as climate change, pollution and waste management) that 
causes a loss of financial value or operating value or that damages the 
Bank’s reputation. This risk arises from commercial and operating activities. 
For  example,  environmental  issues  related  to  the  purchase or  sale  of 
contaminated properties by clients of the Bank or the deployment of large-
scale projects could expose the Bank to credit and reputation risk. The Bank 
has implemented a process that examines supplier practices in order to 
assess their impact on the environment and consider this aspect more 
thoroughly in its decision-making. The Bank has set up a series of eco-
responsible measures that allow for better management of greenhouse gas 
emissions arising from its activities and for a cleaner environment. It is also 
the first Canadian company to obtain Carbon Care Certification from Enviro-
access for its greenhouse gas reduction efforts over the last five years. It is 
working with firms of experts to create an environmental strategy that will 
allow it to contribute more to sustainable development. The Bank is a 
signatory to the Carbon Disclosure Project, which collects and publishes 
information disclosed by companies worldwide regarding their management 
of climate change and their greenhouse gas emissions.  
The Bank would also be forced to deal with operational risk and the risk 
related to the legal environment when environmental issues arise in its 
branches or administrative offices. 
In this context, the Risk Management Group develops requirements that 
are prescribed in its internal policies in order to reveal, assess, control and 
monitor environmental risk. For their part, the business segments and 
corporate units must integrate requirements and controls related to the 
management of environmental risk in their activities. The Risk Management 
Group monitors its application and regularly reviews the standards. Each 
year, the Bank publishes its performance objectives and results in its Social 
Responsibility Report, which is available on its website at nbc.ca. This year 
again, it is one of the 20 greenest banks in the world and it continues to work 
to improve its environmental strategies.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING   
 
 
The consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada (the Bank) have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), 
which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI), the financial statements are to be 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS 
represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
Management maintains the accounting and internal control systems needed to discharge its responsibility, which is to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial accounts are accurate and complete and that the Bank’s assets are adequately safeguarded. Controls that are currently in place include quality 
standards on staff hiring and training; the implementation of organizational structures with clear divisions of responsibility and accountability for 
performance; the Code of Professional Conduct; and the communication of operating policies and procedures.  
 
As Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer, we have overseen the evaluation of the design and operation of the Bank’s internal controls over 
financial reporting in accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosures in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings released by the 
Canadian Securities Administrators. Based on the evaluation work performed, we have concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting were 
effective as at October 31, 2017 and that they provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is reliable and that the Bank’s consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
 
The Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving the financial information contained in the Annual Report. Acting through the 
Audit Committee, the Board also oversees the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and ensures that accounting and control systems are 
maintained. Composed of directors who are neither officers nor employees of the Bank, the Audit Committee is responsible, through Internal Audit, for 
performing an independent and objective review of the Bank’s internal control effectiveness, i.e., governance processes, risk management processes and 
control measures. Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviews the consolidated financial statements and recommends their approval to the Board. 
 
The control systems are supported by the presence of the Compliance Service, which exercises independent oversight in order to assist managers in effectively 
managing regulatory compliance risk and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with regulatory requirements.  
 
The Senior Vice-President of Internal Audit has direct access to the Chair of the Audit Committee and to the President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, 
the Senior Vice-President and Chief Compliance Officer has a direct functional link to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee and direct access to the 
President and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
In accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), OSFI is mandated to protect the rights and interests of the depositors. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into 
the business and affairs of the Bank, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being satisfied and that the Bank is in 
sound financial condition. 
 
The independent auditor, Deloitte LLP, whose report follows, was appointed by the shareholders on the recommendation of the Board. The auditor has full and 
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss audit and financial reporting matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
To the Shareholders of National Bank of Canada 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada (the Bank), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets 
as at October 31, 2017 and 2016, the consolidated statements of income, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements 
of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
The Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at October 31, 2017 and 2016 
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
National Bank of Canada (the Bank) is a financial institution incorporated and domiciled in Canada and whose shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Its head office is located at 600 De La Gauchetière Street West in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Bank is a chartered bank under Schedule 1 of the Bank Act 
(Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). 
 
The Bank provides integrated financial services to consumers, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and large corporations and operates four business 
segments, namely, the Personal and Commercial segment, the Wealth Management segment, the Financial Markets segment, and the U.S. Specialty Finance 
and International (USSF&I) segment. Its full line of services includes banking and investing solutions for individuals and businesses, securities brokerage, 
insurance and wealth management. 
 
On November 30, 2017, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the publication of the Bank’s audited annual consolidated financial statements 
(the consolidated financial statements) for the year ended October 31, 2017. 
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Bank have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as 
otherwise specified by OSFI, the financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI 
accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
On November 1, 2016, the Bank reclassified certain Personal and Commercial segment revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Income to better reflect the 
nature of the income reported. As a result, for the year ended October 31, 2016, an amount of $36 million reported in Non-interest income – Credit fees was 
reclassified to Interest income – Loans.  
 
Also on November 1, 2016, the Bank changed the presentation of certain items on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and certain amounts were revised from 
those previously reported. The Due from clients, dealers and brokers item as at October 31, 2016 is now presented in Other assets on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. All deposits have been grouped into a single Deposits item. To better reflect the nature of certain liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
an amount of $2.2 billion reported in the Due to clients, dealers and brokers item was reclassified to the Deposits item as at October 31, 2016. The Due to 
clients, dealers and brokers item is now presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 
Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions 
In preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management must exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reporting date carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, net income and related information. Furthermore, certain accounting policies require complex 
judgments and estimates because they apply to matters that are inherently uncertain, in particular accounting policies applicable to allowances for credit 
losses, the fair value determination of financial instruments, the impairment of available-for-sale securities, the impairment of non-financial assets, pension 
plans and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, provisions, and the consolidation of structured entities. Descriptions of these judgments and 
estimates are provided in each of the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates, in which case the 
impact is recognized in the consolidated financial statements of future fiscal periods. The accounting policies described in this note provide greater detail 
about the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on judgment. 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements include all of the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries, after elimination of 
intercompany transactions and balances. The subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Bank. A structured entity is an entity 
created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls 
the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. 
 
Management must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank must consolidate an entity. The Bank controls an entity only if the following three 
conditions are met: 
 
—  it has decision-making authority regarding the entity’s relevant activities;  
—  it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and  
—  it has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the returns. 
 
When determining decision-making authority, many factors are taken into account, including the existence and effect of actual and potential voting rights held 
by the Bank that can be exercised as well as the holding of instruments that are convertible into voting shares. In addition, the Bank must determine whether, 
as an investor with decision-making rights, it acts as a principal or agent.  
 
Based on these principles, an assessment of control is performed at the inception of a relationship between any entity and the Bank. When performing this 
assessment, the Bank considers all facts and circumstances, and it must reassess whether it still controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three conditions of control. 
 
The Bank consolidates the entities it controls from the date on which control is obtained and ceases to consolidate them from the date control ceases. The 
Bank uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from a third party on the date control is obtained.   
 
Non-Controlling Interests 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity interests of third parties in the Bank’s subsidiaries and are presented in total Equity, separately 
from Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. The non-controlling interests’ proportionate share in the net income and other comprehensive income of 
the Bank’s subsidiaries are presented in total net income and total comprehensive income, respectively.  
 
With respect to units issued to third parties by mutual funds and certain other funds that are consolidated, they are presented at fair value in Other liabilities 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lastly, changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognized as equity 
transactions. The difference between the adjustment in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognized directly in Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. 
 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
The Bank exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. The 
Bank has joint control over an entity when there’s a contractually agreed sharing of control of an entity that exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 
Investments in associates, i.e., entities over which the Bank exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures, i.e., entities over which the Bank 
has rights to the net assets and exercises joint control, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially 
recorded at cost and, following acquisition, the Bank’s shares in the net income and in the other comprehensive income are recognized, respectively, in Non-
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The 
carrying value of the investment is adjusted by an equivalent amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reduced by distributions received.

Foreign Currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency. Each entity in the group 
determines its own functional currency, and the items reported in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that currency. 
 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the rates in effect on the date of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Translation gains and losses are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Revenues and 
expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
into the functional currency at historical rates. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated using the 
exchange rates in effect on the date fair value is determined, and the translation gains or losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Translation gains or losses on non-monetary items classified as available for sale are recognized in Other comprehensive income. Upon disposal or due to 
impairment of a non-monetary item classified as available for sale, the deferred translation gains or losses are reclassified, in whole or in part, from 
Accumulated other comprehensive income to Non-interest income of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional currency using the rates in 
effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, whereas the revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional 
currency at the average exchange rates for the period. Any goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a foreign operation that does not have the same functional 
currency as the parent company, and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition, are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated using the rates in effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Gains and losses on translating 
the financial statements of foreign operations, along with related hedge and tax effects, are presented in Other comprehensive income. Upon disposal of a 
foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income relating to that particular operation is reclassified 
to Non-interest income of the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments 
In accordance with the accounting framework for financial instruments, all financial assets and liabilities must be classified based on their characteristics, 
management’s intention, or choice of category in certain circumstances. When initially recognized, all financial assets are classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss, held to maturity, available for sale, or loans and receivables, while financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss or as 
financial liabilities at amortized cost. Certain debt securities that are not quoted in an active market may be classified as loans and receivables, and 
impairment is determined using the same model as for loans. Loans and receivables that the Bank intends to sell immediately or in the near term must be 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss, whereas loans and receivables for which the Bank may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, for 
reasons other than credit deterioration, must be classified as available for sale. 
 
When initially recognized, all financial assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. In subsequent periods, they are measured at fair value, except for items classified in the following categories, which are measured at amortized cost 
using the effective interest rate method: financial assets held to maturity, loans and receivables, and financial liabilities at amortized cost. 
 
Under the fair value option, a financial asset or liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized. 
Financial assets thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income. Financial liabilities thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank's own credit risk are 
recognized in Other comprehensive income unless these changes offset the amounts recognized in Net income. Fair value changes not attributable to the 
Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amounts recognized in Other comprehensive 
income will not be subsequently reclassified to Net income. Interest income and expenses arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value 
through profit or loss are recorded in the Net interest income item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following 
cases. 
 
—  If, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or 
recognition mismatch of measuring financial assets or liabilities on a different basis, and if the fair values are reliable. 
—  If a group of financial assets and financial liabilities to which an instrument belongs is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Bank’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information is provided on that basis to senior management. 
Consequently, the Bank may use the fair value option if it has implemented a documented risk management strategy to manage a group of financial 
instruments together on the fair value basis, if it can demonstrate that significant financial risks are eliminated or significantly reduced, and if the fair 
values are reliable. 
—  For hybrid financial instruments with one or more embedded derivatives that would significantly modify the cash flows of the financial instruments and 
that would otherwise be bifurcated and accounted for separately.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 
 
Reclassification of Financial Instruments 
A financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument or a financial asset that, upon initial recognition, was designated as measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category in rare circumstances if the financial asset is no longer held for 
the purpose of selling it in the near term. The financial asset must be reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification, and this fair value becomes its 
new amortized cost, as applicable. No gain or loss previously recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income may be reversed. 
 
Establishing Fair Value 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price).   
  
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, based on bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities, provide the best evidence of fair 
value. A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible 
at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.  
 
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in 
pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The 
estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value. 
 
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or 
paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique 
based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is 
deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized 
balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks 
associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash 
receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.  
 
In certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair 
value but that are not included in the measurement technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or risk related to the 
valuation model, and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments 
when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an 
insufficient volume of transactions in a given market.  
 
As permitted when certain criteria are met, the Bank has elected to determine fair value based on net exposure to credit risk or market risk for certain portfolios 
of financial instruments, mainly derivatives. 
 
Cash and Deposits With Financial Institutions  
Cash and deposits with financial institutions consist of cash and cash equivalents, amounts pledged as collateral as well as amounts placed in escrow. Cash 
comprises cash and bank notes. Cash equivalents consist of deposits with the Bank of Canada, deposits with financial institutions, including net receivables 
related to cheques and other items in the clearing process, as well as the net amount of cheques and other items in transit. 
 
Securities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Securities at fair value through profit or loss are generally purchased for sale in the near term or are part of portfolios of identified financial instruments that 
are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. The Bank accounts for securities transactions at fair 
value through profit or loss on the settlement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value between the trade date and the settlement date 
are included in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value, and transaction fees are recognized directly in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Interest income as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Available-for-Sale Securities 
Securities that are neither classified as at fair value through profit or loss nor as held to maturity nor in the loans and receivables category are classified as 
available-for-sale securities. The Bank accounts for available-for-sale securities transactions on the trade date, and the related transaction costs are 
capitalized.  
 
Available-for-sale securities are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of impairment losses and income taxes, provided 
they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in Other comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, the 
realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income on the 
transaction date. 
 
The amortization of premiums and discounts, calculated using the effective interest rate method, as well as dividend and interest income, are recognized in 
Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Held-to-Maturity Securities 
Held-to-maturity securities are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity that the Bank intends and is able to hold until 
maturity. The Bank accounts for held-to-maturity securities transactions on the trade date, and the related transaction costs are capitalized. These securities 
are initially recognized at fair value. In subsequent periods, they are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment 
loss measured using the same impairment model used for loans. Interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts on these securities are 
recognized in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Obligations Related to Securities Sold  
Under Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned  
The Bank recognizes these transactions at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Securities sold under repurchase agreements remain on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions. 
 
The Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part 
of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral pledged or received in 
the form of cash is recognized in financial assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the collateral is pledged or received in the form of cash, the interest income and expense are recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. 
 
Loans 
Loans, including transaction costs directly attributable to the granting of the loans, other than loans classified or designated as measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Loans classified or designated as 
measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value. 
 
Impairment of Financial Assets 
At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset or group of financial assets. 
There is objective evidence of impairment when one or more loss events occur after the initial recognition of the asset and prior to or on the balance sheet date 
and these events adversely affect the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets in question. Management must exercise judgment to determine 
whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment and to estimate the timing of future cash flows. 
 
Available-for-Sale Securities 
Available-for-sale securities are reviewed for objective evidence of impairment at the end of each reporting period. The Bank considers all available objective 
evidence of impairment, including observable data about loss events such as: a significant financial difficulty of the issuer, a breach of contract such as a 
default, and situations involving bankruptcy or other financial reorganization. In addition to these loss events, objective evidence of impairment for an equity 
security also includes information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic, or legal 
environment in which the issuer operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity security may not be recovered. For equity securities, a 
significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost is also considered objective evidence of impairment.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 
 
If there is objective evidence of impairment, any amount previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to Non-
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This amount is determined as the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any capital 
repayments and amortization) and the current fair value of the asset less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognized in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. 
 
Once an impairment loss has been recognized for an available-for-sale security, the subsequent accounting treatment depends on whether the instrument is a 
debt or equity security. 
 
—  For an available-for-sale debt security, a subsequent decline in fair value will be accounted for in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income when there is further objective evidence of impairment as a result of further decreases in the estimated future cash flows of the debt security. 
Impairment losses recognized in income relating to an available-for-sale debt security must be reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Income when, 
in a subsequent period, the fair value of the security increases and the increase can be objectively associated with an event occurring after the loss was 
recognized. 
—  For an available-for-sale equity security, subsequent decreases in fair value are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Impairment 
losses recognized are not reversed through the Consolidated Statement of Income. All subsequent increases in fair value will be accounted for in Other 
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
  
Impaired Loans 
A loan, except credit card receivables, is considered impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment and, in management’s best estimate, the timely 
collection of principal and interest is no longer reasonably assured, or when a payment is contractually 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully secured and 
collection efforts are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt within 180 days. For credit card receivables, they are written off when payment is 
180 days in arrears. Loans that are insured or fully guaranteed by a Canadian government (federal or provincial) or by a Canadian government agency are 
considered impaired when more than 365 days in arrears. 
 
When a counterparty to a loan fails to make the payment when contractually due, that loan is considered past due but not impaired. 
 
When a loan is deemed impaired, interest recognition ceases and the carrying amount of the loan is reduced to its estimated realizable amount by writing off 
all or part of the loan or by taking an allowance for credit losses. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the present value of expected future cash 
flows, discounted at the initial effective interest rate of the loan, to its current carrying amount including accrued interest. The losses are recorded in Provisions 
for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
A loan is returned to performing status when the timely collection of future interest and principal is reasonably assured and when all principal and interest 
payments in arrears have been collected. 
 
A loan and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be non-
existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances 
owing are not likely to be recovered.  
 
Situations where a retail, commercial or government borrower begin showing clear signs of potential insolvency are managed on a case-by-case basis and 
require the use of judgment. In these situations, the Bank may grant a concession to the borrower regarding the original terms and conditions of the loan, for 
example by reducing the rate, granting a forgiveness of principal or extending the term despite the Bank’s credit policies. Once the terms of the loan have been 
renegotiated and agreed upon with the borrower, the loan is considered a restructured loan. As of the restructuring date, the current carrying amount of the 
loan, including accrued interest, is reduced to the present value of expected cash flows under the modified terms, discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the loan. The reduction in the carrying value is recorded in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Allowances for Credit Losses 
Allowances for credit losses are management’s best estimate of losses in its credit portfolio as at the balance sheet date. They relate primarily to loans but may 
also cover the credit risk associated with deposits with financial institutions, loan substitute securities, credit instruments such as acceptances, and off-
balance-sheet items such as commitments to extend credit, letters of guarantee and letters of credit.  
 
Changes in allowances for credit losses attributable to the passage of time are recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income, whereas 
changes attributable to a revision of expected payments are recorded in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the allowances 
were recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed directly in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The allowances for credit losses on impaired loans are calculated on a loan-by-loan basis and assessed either individually or collectively based on the 
portfolio’s historical net loss experience. The allowance for credit losses on non-impaired loans is assessed collectively. 
 
Allowances on Impaired Loans 
Impairment allowances are recorded for all individually identified impaired loans to reduce their carrying amount to the estimated realizable amount. For each 
impaired loan, the Bank records an individual allowance, when the credit loss assessment is based on a detailed analysis of the borrower’s file, or a collective 
allowance, when the credit loss assessment is based on the portfolio’s historical net loss experience. 
 
For all individually significant impaired loans, namely business and government loans, and for certain impaired loans that are not individually significant, 
namely residential mortgages, the Bank records an individual allowance since the credit loss assessment is based on a detailed analysis of the borrower’s file. 
For all other impaired loans that are not individually significant but have been individually identified as impaired, the Bank records for each such loan a 
collective allowance based on historical net loss experience. 
 
Allowances on Non-Impaired Loans 
When the credit risk of a portfolio of loans that have similar credit risk characteristics increases significantly, such as a group of loans of a specific industry, 
but the loans have yet to be individually identified as impaired, a sectoral allowance is established collectively for the entire loan portfolio. The sectoral 
allowance is determined using an approach similar to the collective allowance measurement on non-impaired loans, i.e., an approach based on expected 
default and loss factors determined by statistical analysis of historical loss data by loan type, and on an analysis of the industry-specific market factors such 
as market liquidity, credit spreads, and risk factor levels. 
 
All loans that have not been individually identified as impaired, and that are not covered by a sectoral allowance, are grouped according to their credit risk 
characteristics for the purpose of calculating a collective allowance on non-impaired loans. The collective allowance on non-impaired loans includes two 
components for credit risk: the allocated collective allowance and the unallocated collective allowance. 
 
The allocated collective allowance for the business and government loan portfolio is based on expected default and loss factors determined by statistical 
analysis of historical loss data, delineated by loan type, to which is added an amount that takes into account the discovery period and migration risk. For 
personal loans, the allocated collective allowance is calculated based on specific parameters by product, and no discovery period is calculated. Losses are 
determined by the application of loss ratios established through statistical analysis of historical loss data.  
 
The unallocated collective allowance reflects management’s assessment of probable portfolio losses that have not been captured by the allocated collective 
allowance. This assessment takes into account general economic and business conditions, recent credit loss data, and credit quality and concentration trends 
when the collective allowance is determined at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This allowance also reflects model and estimation risks. The unallocated 
collective allowance does not represent future losses or serve as a substitute for the allocated collective allowance. 
 
The sectoral allowance and collective allowance on non-impaired loans are collectively established and reflect the impairment losses that the Bank has 
incurred as a result of events that have occurred but where the individual loss has not been identified. 
 
Purchased Receivables 
On the acquisition date, purchased receivables are measured at fair value, which incorporates incurred and expected credit losses estimated on the 
acquisition date and the interest rate differential between the receivable’s contractual interest rate and the current market rates for the remaining term. As a 
result, no allowances for credit losses are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on the acquisition date. Discounts related to incurred credit losses are 
not amortized.  
 
Purchased performing receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on their contractual cash flows, and any discount or premium is 
considered an adjustment to the loan yield and is amortized over the expected life of the receivable using the effective interest rate method and recorded in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
When receivables are acquired with objective evidence of incurred credit loss, where the timely collection of contractual principal and interest is not 
reasonably assured, these receivables are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted 
at the initial effective interest rate. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank re-evaluates the expected future cash flows and adjusts the carrying amount 
of the receivables to reflect the revised expected future cash flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate. This adjustment is immediately recorded in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 
 
Derecognition of Financial Assets and Securitization 
A financial asset is considered for derecognition when the Bank has transferred contractual rights to receive the cash flows or assumed an obligation to 
transfer these cash flows to a third party. The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when it considers that substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset 
have been transferred or when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset expire. When the Bank considers that it has retained substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of the transferred asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset and, if applicable, recognizes a financial liability on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. If, due to a derivative financial instrument, the transfer of a financial asset does not result in derecognition, the derivative 
financial instrument is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards related to a financial asset, it derecognizes the financial asset it no 
longer controls. Any rights and obligations retained following the asset transfer are recognized separately as an asset or liability. If the Bank retains control of 
the financial asset, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset, i.e., to the extent to which it is exposed to 
changes in the value of the transferred asset. 
 
In order to diversify its funding sources, the Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the 
Mortgage-Backed Securities Program under the National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. Under the first program, the 
Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgages and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT). As 
part of these transactions, the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards related to ownership of the mortgage loans sold. Therefore, the insured 
mortgage loans securitized under the CMB program continue to be recognized in the Loans item on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and the liabilities 
for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Moreover, 
insured mortgage loans securitized and retained by the Bank continue to be recognized in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. The difference between the carrying value of the financial liability 
transferred and the consideration paid is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Acceptances and Customers’ Liability Under Acceptances  
The potential liability of the Bank under acceptances is recorded as a customer commitment liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank’s potential 
recourse vis à vis clients is recorded as an equivalent offsetting asset. Fees are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short 
This financial liability represents the Bank’s obligation to deliver the securities it sold but did not own at the time of sale. Obligations related to securities sold 
short are recorded at fair value and presented as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in 
Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments  
In the normal course of business, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments to meet the needs of its clients, to generate trading activity revenues, and to 
manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and other market risks. 
 
All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are 
included in assets, and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value are included in liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Embedded Derivative Financial Instruments 
An embedded derivative financial instrument is a component of a financial instrument or another contract, the characteristics of which are similar to those of a 
derivative product. Taken together, the financial instrument or contract is considered to be a hybrid instrument comprising a host contract and an embedded 
derivative financial instrument. 
 
Embedded derivatives are bifurcated and accounted for separately if, and only if, the following three conditions are met: the economic characteristics and risks 
of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, the embedded derivative is a separate instrument that meets the definition of 
a derivative financial instrument, and the hybrid contract is not recorded at fair value.  
 
Embedded derivatives that must be bifurcated and separately accounted for are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized and 
unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In general, all embedded derivatives are 
presented on a combined basis with the host contract. However, certain embedded derivatives that are bifurcated from the host contract are presented in 
Derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Held-for-Trading Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses (including interest income and expense) are 
recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Policy 
The purpose of a hedging transaction is to modify the Bank’s exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the 
cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting ensures that offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period or periods. 
 
Documenting and Assessing Effectiveness 
The Bank designates and formally documents each hedging relationship, at its inception, by detailing the risk management objective and the hedging strategy. 
The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability or cash flows being hedged, the related hedging instrument, the nature of the specific risk exposure or 
exposures being hedged, the intended term of the hedging relationship and the method for assessing the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the hedging 
relationship. At the inception of the hedging relationship, and for every financial reporting period for which the hedge has been designated, the Bank ensures 
that the hedging relationship is highly effective and consistent with its originally documented risk management objective and strategy. When a hedging 
relationship meets the hedge accounting requirements, it is designated as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a foreign exchange hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation. 
 
Fair Value Hedge 
In a fair value hedge, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of a hedged item. The carrying amount of the hedged item is 
adjusted based on the effective portion of the gains or losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, 
as well as the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The resulting ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.  
 
The Bank prospectively discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting or if the Bank revokes the designation. When the designation is revoked, the hedged item is no longer adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, and 
the amounts previously recorded as cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are 
amortized using the effective interest rate method and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. If 
the hedged item is sold or terminated before maturity, the cumulative adjustments to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk 
are immediately recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Cash Flow Hedge 
In a cash flow hedge, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge variable cash flows attributable to the hedged risk related to a 
financial asset or liability (or to a group of financial assets or liabilities). The effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized 
in Other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
The amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income of the period or 
periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the 
hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank cancels that designation, then the amounts previously recognized in Accumulated 
other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item 
affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Hedge of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation  
Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge foreign exchange risk related to investments made in foreign operations whose 
functional currency is not the Canadian dollar. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive 
income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon the total or partial sale of a net investment in a 
foreign operation, amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified, in whole or in part, to Non-interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Leasehold improvements    Straight-line   (1)  
 
(1)  The average amortization period is 15 years, determined using the lesser of the useful life or the lease term plus the first renewal option. 
 
Goodwill  
The Bank uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the 
acquisition-date fair value and the transaction costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Bank acquires control of a business, all of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, including intangible assets, are recorded at fair value. The interests previously held in the acquiree are 
also measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration and all previously held interests over the fair value of identifiable 
net assets of the acquiree. If the fair value of identifiable net assets exceeds the purchase consideration and all previously held interests, the difference is 
immediately recognized as a gain on a bargain purchase. 
 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Bank’s ownership interest and can be initially 
measured at either fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The measurement basis is 
selected on a case-by-case basis. Following the acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the value assigned to those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
 
Intangible Assets 
Intangible Assets With Finite Useful Lives  
Software and certain other intangible assets are recognized at cost net of accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible 
assets are systematically amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which vary between four and ten years. The amortization expense is 
recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Intangible Assets With Indefinite Useful Lives 
The Bank’s intangible assets with indefinite useful lives come from the acquisition of subsidiaries or groups of assets and consist of management contracts 
and a trademark. They are recognized at the acquisition-date fair value. The management contracts are for the management of open-ended funds. At the end of 
each reporting period, the Bank reviews the useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
assessment. Intangible assets are deemed to have an indefinite useful life following an examination of all relevant factors, in particular: a) the contracts do not 
have contractual maturities; b) the stability of the business segment to which the intangible assets belong; c) the Bank’s capacity to control the future 
economic benefits of the intangible assets; and d) the continued economic benefits generated by the intangible assets.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
Premises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or 
intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use or that have indefinite useful lives 
are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.  
 
An asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual 
asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
the asset belongs will be determined. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs. 
 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of 
expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such 
as projected future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a 
significant impact on income. 
 
Corporate assets, such as the head office building and computer equipment, do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. Therefore, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management has 
decided to dispose of the asset. However, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU or 
group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of this CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or groups of CGUs. For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill 
resulting from a business combination must be allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. 
Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must represent the lowest level for which the goodwill is monitored internally at the Bank and must 
not be larger than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU or group of CGUs involves management’s judgment. If an impairment loss is to be 
recognized, the Bank does so by first reducing the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs and then reducing the carrying amounts 
of the other assets of the CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment 
loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than 
goodwill must be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment 
was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased, as the impairment loss was reversed, but shall not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for this asset in previous years. 
 
Leases 
A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in return for a payment or series of 
payments. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. Title may or 
may not eventually be transferred. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. The Bank primarily enters into operating leases. 
 
When the Bank is the lessee under an operating lease, the rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in Non-interest expenses in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income. When the Bank is the lessor, the lease assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported in premises 
and equipment, and the rental income is recognized net of related expenses in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a 
past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant 
risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money. The provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. 
Provisions are presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont.) 
 
Revenue Recognition 
The Bank’s revenues are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as they are earned. 
 
Interest Income and Expense 
Interest income and expense, except for the interest income on securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in Net interest income 
and calculated using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through 
the expected life of the financial instrument (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) to the net carrying amount of the instrument. When calculating the 
effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but without considering future credit losses 
and also includes all fees paid or received related to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums 
or discounts. 
 
Commission Revenues 
Loan origination fees, including commitment, restructuring and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan. They are 
deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Direct costs for 
originating a loan are netted against the loan origination fees. If it is likely that a commitment will result in a loan, commitment fees receive the same 
accounting treatment, i.e., they are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over 
the term of the loan. Otherwise, they are recorded in Non-interest income over the term of the commitment.  
 
Loan syndication fees are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders 
involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the 
amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Certain mortgage loan prepayment fees are recognized in Interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income when earned. 
 
Dividend Income 
Dividends from an equity instrument are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the Bank’s right to receive payment is established. 
 
Insurance Revenues 
Insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, are arrangements under which one party accepts significant insurance risk by agreeing to compensate 
the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event were to occur. Gross premiums, net of premiums transferred under reinsurance contracts, are recognized 
when they become due. Royalties received from reinsurers are recognized when earned. Claims are recognized when received and an amount is estimated as 
they are being processed. All of these amounts are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income  in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Upon recognition of a premium, a reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized, respectively, in Other assets and in Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of the reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized on a net basis in 
Non-interest income  in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes include current taxes and deferred taxes and are recorded in net income except for income taxes generated by items recognized in Other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
 
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable income for a period. It is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates 
prevailing on the reporting date, and any adjustments recognized in the period for current tax of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset and 
the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability. 
 
Deferred tax is established based on temporary differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, in accordance with enacted 
or substantively enacted income tax laws and rates that will apply on the date the differences will reverse. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary 
differences related to the following: 
 
—  the initial accounting of goodwill; 
—  the initial accounting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting income nor taxable income;   
—  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; 
—  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that there will not be taxable income to which the temporary difference can be recognized.

AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(millions of Canadian dollars) 
  
Deferred tax assets are tax benefits in the form of deductions the Bank may claim to reduce its taxable income in future years. At the end of each reporting 
period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is revised and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be 
available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when 
the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets and liabilities, and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities that intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities based on their net 
amount. 
 
The Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process includes estimating the actual amount of 
current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of the items reported for accounting 
and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are calculated according to the tax rates to be 
applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current 
information.  
 
Moreover, the Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of various tax authorities. In the normal course of its business, the Bank is involved in a number of 
transactions for which the tax impacts are uncertain. As a result, the Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the tax 
risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. The amounts of these 
provisions reflect the best possible estimates of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. The provisions 
are estimated at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that an adjustment to the provision needs to be recognized at a future date following 
an audit by the tax authorities. When the final assessment differs from the initially provisioned amounts, the difference will impact the income taxes of the 
period in which the assessment was made.  
 
Financial Guarantee Contracts 
A financial guarantee contract is a contract or indemnification agreement that could require the Bank to make specified payments (in cash, financial 
instruments, other assets, Bank shares, or provisions of services) to reimburse the beneficiary in the event of a loss resulting from a debtor defaulting on the 
original or amended terms of a debt instrument. 
 
To reflect the fair value of the obligation assumed at the inception of a financial guarantee, a liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. After initial recognition, the Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the estimated amount needed to settle the 
financial obligation under the guarantee or the amount initially recognized less, where applicable, the accumulated amortization that corresponds to revenue 
earned during the period. This revenue is recognized in Credit fees in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Employee Benefits – Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The other post-employment benefit plans 
include post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage. While pension plans are funded, the other plans are not. 
 
Plan expenses and obligations are actuarially determined based on the projected benefit method prorated on service. The calculations use management’s best 
estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and retirement 
age.  
 
The net asset or net liability of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the 
present value of the future benefits earned by employees in respect of current- and prior-period service and the fair value of plan assets. The net asset or net 
liability is included in either the Other assets or Other liabilities item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 
The expense related to pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans consists of the following items: current service cost, net interest on the net 
plan asset or liability, administration costs and past service cost, if any, recognized when a plan is amended. This expense is recognized in Compensation and 
employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The net amount of interest income and expense is determined by applying a discount rate to the 
net plan asset or liability amount. 
 
Remeasurements resulting from pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans represent actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit 
obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net asset or liability of the plans. 
Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income; these cumulative gains 
and losses are reclassified to Retained earnings.

Share-Based Payments 
The Bank has several share-based compensation plans: the Stock Option Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan, the Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plan, 
the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan, the Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of National Bank Financial and the 
Employee Share Ownership Plan. 
 
Compensation expense is recognized over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the award. This period is generally the same as 
the vesting period, except where the required service period begins before the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees 
eligible to retire on the award date is immediately recognized on the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees who will 
become eligible to retire during the vesting period is recognized over the period from the award date to the date the employee becomes eligible to retire. For all 
of these plans, as of the first year of recognition, the expense includes cancellation and forfeiture estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as 
necessary. The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with some of these plans. The compensation expense for these plans, 
net of related hedges, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Under the Stock Option Plan, the Bank uses the fair value method to account for stock options awarded. The options vest at 25% per year, and each tranche is 
treated as though it was a separate award. The fair value of each of the tranches is measured on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and this fair 
value is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits and Contributed surplus. When the options are exercised, the Contributed surplus amount is 
credited to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds received from the employees when these options are exercised are also 
credited to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
SARs are recorded at fair value when awarded and their fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until they are exercised. The cost is 
recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 
obligation that results from the change in fair value at each period is recognized in net income gradually over the vesting period, and periodically thereafter, 
until the SARs are exercised. When a SAR is exercised, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the increase in the stock price since the date of the award. 
 
The obligation that results from the award of a DSU, RSU, PSU and DCP unit is recognized in net income, and the corresponding amount is included in Other 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the DSU, RSU and DCP plans, the change in the obligation attributable to variations in the share price and 
dividends paid on common shares for these plans is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the 
period in which the variations occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date. For the 
PSU Plan, the change in the obligation attributable to changes in the stock price, adjusted upward or downward depending on the relative result of the 
performance criteria, and the change in the obligation attributable to dividends paid on the shares awarded under the plan, are recognized in Compensation 
and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period in which the changes occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash 
payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date, adjusted upward or downward according to the performance criteria. This is based on the total 
shareholder return (TSR) achieved by the Bank compared to that of the S&P/TSX Banks adjusted sub-index. 
 
The Bank’s contributions to the employee share ownership plan are expensed as incurred.

NOTE 2 – FUTURE ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES 
  
The IASB issues revisions and amendments to a number of standards, some of which have already had an impact on the Bank and others that could have an 
impact in the future. The Bank is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the following standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. A 
summary of these amendments and the effective dates applicable to the Bank are presented below.  
 
Effective Date – Early Adoption on November 1, 2017 
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 
In July 2014, the IASB issued a complete and final version of IFRS 9, which replaces the guidance in IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. IFRS 9 sets out requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, for the impairment of financial 
assets, and for general hedge accounting. Macro hedge accounting has been decoupled from IFRS 9 and will be considered and issued as a separate standard. 
As a result of IFRS 9, consequential amendments have been made to IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures, requiring additional qualitative and 
quantitative disclosures that must be adopted at the same time as IFRS 9. In December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued Guidance on 
Credit Risk and Accounting for Expected Credit Losses. In June 2016, OSFI issued the final guideline on IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and Disclosures, setting 
out its expectations regarding IFRS 9 application.  
 
For the Bank, the IFRS 9 effective date is November 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. However, on January 9, 2015, OSFI issued a final version of Early 
Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for Domestic Systemically Important Banks and stated therein that it expects Domestic Systemically Important Banks 
(D-SIBs), a group that includes the Bank, to adopt IFRS 9 as of November 1, 2017. The Bank will therefore adopt IFRS 9 as of November 1, 2017. Its first 
financial statements presented in accordance with IFRS 9 will be its unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ending 
January 31, 2018. In general, IFRS 9 is to be applied retrospectively. As permitted by IFRS 9, the Bank will not restate the comparative period financial 
statements. The retrospective impact of applying IFRS 9 will be accounted for through adjustments to the opening balances of Retained earnings, Accumulated 
other comprehensive income and Non-controlling interests as at November 1, 2017.   
  
Classification and Measurement 
IFRS 9 provides a single model for financial asset classification and measurement that is based on both the business model for managing financial assets and 
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss. 
 
IFRS 9 requires that all debt instrument financial assets, including loans, that do not meet a “solely payment of principal and interest” (SPPI) condition, 
including those that contain embedded derivatives, be classified as at fair value through profit or loss. For those that meet the SPPI condition, classification at 
initial recognition will be determined based on the business model under which these assets are managed. Upon transition, the business model test will be 
based on the facts and circumstances as at November 1, 2017. Debt instruments that are being managed on a “held for trading” or fair value basis will be 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss. Debt instruments that are managed on a “hold to collect and for sale” basis will be classified as at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. Finally, debt instruments that are managed on a “hold to collect” basis will be classified as at amortized cost. In 
addition, IFRS 9 also includes an option to irrevocably designate, at initial recognition, a debt instrument as measured at fair value through profit or loss if 
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch and if OSFI requirements are also met. This designation is also available for existing 
financial assets and liabilities at the date of IFRS 9 adoption. 
 
Under IFRS 9, all equity instrument financial assets must be classified as at fair value through profit or loss. However, the Bank may, at initial recognition of a 
non-trading equity instrument, irrevocably elect to designate the instrument as at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent 
reclassification of gains and losses to net income. Dividends will continue to be recognized in net income. This designation is also available for existing non-
trading equity instruments at the date of IFRS 9 adoption. Derivative financial instruments will continue to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
The classification and measurement of financial liabilities remain essentially unchanged under IFRS 9, except for financial liabilities designated as measured 
at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option. Once the fair value election is made, changes in fair value attributable to changes in an entity’s 
own credit risk must be recognized in Other comprehensive income rather than in net income. On February 1, 2016, the Bank early adopted, on a prospective 
basis, the own credit risk provisions of IFRS 9.

NOTE 2 – FUTURE ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES (cont.) 
  
Impairment 
Overall Comparison of the New Impairment Model and the Current Model 
IFRS 9 introduces a new, single impairment model for financial assets that requires the recognition of expected credit losses (ECL) rather than incurred losses 
as applied under the current standard. Currently, impairment losses are recognized if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one 
or more loss events that occurred after initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
asset that can be reliably estimated. If there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individual financial asset, that financial asset is included in a group 
of assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment losses incurred but not yet identified. Under IFRS 9, ECLs will be 
recognized in profit or loss before a loss event has occurred, which could result in earlier recognition of credit losses compared to the current model. 
 
Under the current standard, incurred losses are measured by incorporating reasonable and supportable information about past events and current conditions. 
Under IFRS 9, the ECL model, which is forward-looking, in addition requires that forecasts of future events and economic conditions be used when determining 
significant increases in credit risk and when measuring expected losses. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price 
indices, interest rates, and gross domestic product will be incorporated into the risk parameters. Estimating forward-looking information will require 
significant judgment and must be consistent with the forward-looking information used by the Bank for other purposes, such as forecasting and budgeting. 
 
Scope 
The impairment model applies to all financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss. The ECL model also applies to loan commitments and 
financial guarantees that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Measurement of Expected Credit Losses 
ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. The 
measurement of ECLs will be based primarily on the product of the instrument’s probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default 
(EAD). IFRS 9 requires the estimate of expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range 
of possible outcomes. The Bank will incorporate three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside 
scenario, and a downside scenario. Probability-weights will be attributed to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights will be reassessed quarterly 
and subject to management review.  
 
The ECL model contains a three-stage approach that is based on the change in the credit quality of assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the 
credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, 
and a loss allowance that is measured, at each reporting date, at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and a loss allowance that is measured, at 
each reporting date, at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial 
instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to recognition of 
12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset have 
occurred, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance equal to lifetime expected losses continues to be 
recorded or the financial asset is written off.  
 
Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount of the financial assets in 
Stage 3.

Assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk 
To assess whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly, the PD occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date is 
compared with the PD occurring over its expected life on the date of initial recognition, and reasonable and supportable information indicative of significant 
increases in credit risk since initial recognition is considered. The Bank has included relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in 
credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate 
that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.  
 
Definition of Default 
IFRS 9 does not define default but requires the definition to be consistent with the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes. However, IFRS 9 
contains a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90 days past due. Under IFRS 9, the Bank will consider a 
financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, as credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of a financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past due. The backstop for credit card receivables will be 180 days past due. 
The Bank’s write-off policy under IAS 39 is not expected to be materially different under IFRS 9.   
  
Comparison of Regulatory Expected Credit Loss Model and IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Model 
The IFRS 9 ECL calculation has leveraged, where appropriate, the expected credit loss model parameters used by the Bank for regulatory purposes, namely: PD, 
LGD and EAD. Adjustments to these parameters were made to comply with IFRS 9 requirements. After the adoption of IFRS 9, an ECL model will be used for both 
regulatory and accounting purposes. However, there are key differences, which are summarized below.

Regulatory Capital 
On March 29, 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released details on the interim regulatory treatment for accounting provisions as well 
as standards for transitional arrangements. Given the coming into effect of IFRS 9, the BCBS will retain the current Basel Accord regulatory treatment for 
provisions during a transition period. Jurisdictions may adopt transitional measures to phase in any potential significant negative impacts on regulatory capital 
arising from the new expected credit loss impairment model under IFRS 9. On August 21, 2017, OSFI released for comment a new, revised version of the 
Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline to be implemented in the first quarter of 2018. Consistent with the BCBS position, the proposed CAR Guideline 
retains the current regulatory treatment of accounting provisions. As for transitional measures to phase-in any potential negative impacts on regulatory capital, 
on November 29, 2017, OSFI has announced that no mitigation measures will be allowed for banks whose capital position could be significantly affected by 
IFRS 9 adoption. 
 
Hedge Accounting 
IFRS 9 introduces a new general hedge accounting model that better aligns hedge accounting with risk management activities. However, the current hedge 
accounting requirements under IAS 39 may continue to be applied until the IASB finalizes its macro hedge accounting project. As permitted, the Bank elected 
not to adopt the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements and instead will continue applying the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements. The Bank will, however, 
comply with the revised hedge accounting disclosures required by the consequential amendments made to IFRS 7.

NOTE 2 – FUTURE ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES (cont.) 
  
 
Transition Impact 
As at October 31, 2017, the Bank’s best estimate of the impact of transitioning to IFRS 9 is a decrease of approximately $165 million, net of income taxes, in 
equity as at November 1, 2017, and a decrease of approximately 16 basis points in the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio. The estimate of the impact 
for the Bank relates primarily to the classification and measurement requirements, in particular the election to irrevocably designate certain financial assets 
and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option, as permitted by the IFRS 9 transitional provisions.  
 
The estimate of the impact of applying the new impairment model for financial assets is not significant. The Bank continues to refine and validate the new 
impairment models leading up to the disclosure of its 2018 first quarter results. 
 
Effective Date – November 1, 2018 
IFRS 15 – Revenue From Contracts With Customers 
In May 2014, the IASB issued a new standard, IFRS 15, which replaces the current revenue recognition standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 provides a single 
comprehensive model to use when accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new model applies to all contracts with customers except 
those that are within the scope of other IFRS standards such as leases, insurance contracts and financial instruments. As a result, the majority of the Bank’s 
revenue, including net interest income, will not be impacted. 
 
At its meeting on July 22, 2015, the IASB unanimously confirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of IFRS 15 to fiscal years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2018, which will be November 1, 2018 for the Bank. In April 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 15, clarifying some requirements and 
providing additional transitional relief at the date of initial application. 
 
On transition, IFRS 15 permits to either restate prior periods or to apply the standard on a modified retrospective basis. The Bank plans to use the modified 
retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of Retained earnings as at 
November 1, 2018, without restating comparative periods. 
 
While the impact assessment is not complete, the Bank does not currently expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a significant impact on the consolidated 
financial statements. The Bank is continuing to review its revenue contracts that fall within the scope of IFRS 15 and to assess the impact of the new standard 
on its consolidated financial statements, including the additional disclosure requirements.  
 
Effective Date – November 1, 2019 
IFRS 16 – Leases 
In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard, IFRS 16 – Leases. The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet using a 
single model, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessor accounting, however, remains similar to current accounting 
practice, and the distinction between operating and finance leases is retained. Early application is permitted if IFRS 15 – Revenue From Contracts With 
Customers is also applied. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments 
In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23, which addresses how to reflect tax treatment uncertainty in accounting for income taxes.  
 
Effective Date – November 1, 2021 
IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, a new standard that replaces IFRS 4, the current insurance contract accounting standard. IFRS 17 
introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information.

Establishing Fair Value 
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price). 
 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets provide the best evidence of fair value. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank applies other 
valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and that minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Such valuation techniques include 
the following: using information available from recent market transactions, referring to the current fair value of a comparable financial instrument, applying 
discounted cash flow analysis, applying option pricing models, or relying on any other valuation technique that is commonly used by market participants and 
has proven to yield reliable estimates. Judgment is required when applying many of the valuation techniques. The Bank’s valuation was based on its 
assessment of the conditions prevailing as at October 31, 2017 and may change in the future. Furthermore, there may be valuation uncertainty resulting from 
the choice of valuation model used. 
 
Valuation Governance 
Fair value is established in accordance with a rigorous control framework. The Bank has policies and procedures that govern the process for determining fair 
value. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All valuation models are validated, and controls have been 
implemented to ensure that they are applied.  
 
The fair value of existing or new products is determined and validated by functions independent of the risk-taking team. Complex fair value matters are 
reviewed by valuation committees made up of experts from various specialized functions. 
 
For financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Bank has documented the classification policies to determine the hierarchy, and 
there are controls in place to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, reliably and consistently. Valuation methods and the underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on a regular basis. 
 
Valuation Methods and Assumptions 
Financial Instruments Whose Fair Value Equals Carrying Value 
The carrying value of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: 
 
—  cash and deposits with financial institutions; 
—  securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed; 
—  obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned; 
—  customers’ liability under acceptances; 
—  acceptances; 
—  purchased receivables; 
—  certain items of other assets and other liabilities. 
 
Securities and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short 
These financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Their fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets, i.e., 
bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities. If there are no quoted prices in an active market, fair value is estimated based on prices 
for securities that, in substance, are identical. If such prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that incorporate 
assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices, the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value 
of money, credit risk, interest rate yield curves and currency rates. 
 
When one or more significant inputs are not observable in the markets, fair value is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that 
consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the specific characteristics of the financial asset or liability and other relevant 
factors. 
 
Securities Issued or Guaranteed by Governments 
Securities issued or guaranteed include government debt securities of the governments of Canada (federal, provincial and municipal) as well as debt securities 
of the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury), of other U.S. agencies and of other foreign governments. The fair value of these securities is based on unadjusted 
quoted prices in active markets. For those classified in Level 2, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets are used to determine fair 
value. In the absence of an observable market, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on 
benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities.

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont.)  
 
Equity Securities and Other Debt Securities 
The fair value of equity securities is determined primarily by using quoted prices in active markets. For equity securities and other debt securities classified in 
Level 2, a valuation technique based on quoted prices of identical and similar instruments in an active market is used to determine fair value. In the absence of 
observable inputs, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, 
LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. For those classified in Level 3, fair value can be determined based on the net asset value, which 
represents the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from investment or fund managers or the general partners of the limited 
partnerships. Fair value can also be determined using internal valuation techniques adjusted for risk factors related to the financial instruments and for 
economic conditions. 
 
Restructured Notes of the Master Asset Vehicle (MAV) Conduits  
In establishing the fair value of the restructured notes of the MAV conduits classified as Level 2, the Bank considered the quality of the underlying assets. The 
Bank determined fair value using a valuation technique that incorporates discounted cash flows. For the restructured notes of the MAV I and MAV II conduits, 
the discount rate is based 80% on the CDX.IG index tranches and 20% on a basket of securities backed by assets such as credit card receivables, Residential 
Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS), Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) and automobile loans.  
 
In establishing the fair value of the restructured notes, the Bank adjusts, as required, its liquidity assumption to reflect market conditions. The Bank 
determines the fair value of the restructured notes of the MAV conduits it is holding by comparing the value obtained using the above-described methodology 
against a range of values. The values situated in this range were obtained by adjusting various liquidity scenarios. 
 
Other Restructured Notes of MAV I and MAV II Conduits 
The fair value of these financial instruments, which are classified in Level 3, is determined based on the net asset value, which represents the estimated value 
of a security based on valuations received from the administrator of the conduits. 
 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For exchange-traded derivative financial instruments, fair value 
is based on the quoted price in an active market, i.e., bid prices for financial assets or offered prices for financial liabilities.  
 
For over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments, fair value is determined using well established valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions 
based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices and the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, 
interest rate yield curves, credit curves, currency rates as well as price and rate volatility factors. In establishing the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments, the Bank also incorporates the following factors: 
 
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) 
The CVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. For each counterparty, the CVA is 
based on the expected positive exposure and probabilities of default through time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as 
current and potential future market values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The default probabilities are 
inferred using credit default swap (CDS) spreads. When unavailable, relevant proxies are used. While the general methodology currently assumes 
independence between expected positive exposures and probabilities of default, adjustments are applied to certain types of transactions where there is a 
direct link between the exposure at default and the default probabilities. 
 
Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) 
The DVA reflects the Bank’s own credit risk in the valuation of derivative financial instruments. The DVA is based on the expected negative exposure and 
probabilities of default of the Bank over time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as current and potential future market 
values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The market implied spreads of the Bank are used in the calculation of 
the DVA.

Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) 
The FVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for 
uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. The expected exposures are determined using methodologies consistent with the CVA and DVA 
framework. The funding level used to determine the FVA is based on the average funding level of relevant market participants. 
 
When the valuation techniques incorporate one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the markets, the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, 
the specific characteristics of the financial asset or financial liability and other relevant factors. 
 
Loans 
The fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows, adjusted for several factors, including 
prepayment options, current market interest rates for similar loans, and other relevant variables where applicable. The fair value of variable-rate mortgage 
loans is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of other fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates charged for 
similar new loans. The fair value of variable-rate loans is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
Deposits 
The fair value of fixed-term deposits is determined primarily by discounting expected future contractual cash flows and considering several factors such as 
redemption options and market interest rates currently offered for financial instruments with similar conditions. For certain term funding instruments, fair 
value is determined using market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of demand deposits and notice deposits is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of structured deposit notes is established using valuation models that maximize the use of observable inputs when available, such as 
benchmark indices, and also incorporates the DVA, which reflects the Bank’s own credit risk. In calculating DVA, the market implied spreads of the Bank are 
used to infer its probabilities of default. Lastly, when fair value is determined using option pricing models, the valuation techniques are similar to those 
described for derivative financial instruments. 
Liabilities Related to Transferred Receivables 
These liabilities arise from sale transactions to Canada Housing Trust (CHT) of securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities under 
the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. These transactions do not qualify for derecognition. They are recorded as guaranteed borrowings, which results in 
the recording of liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these liabilities is established using valuation techniques based on observable 
market inputs such as Canada Mortgage Bond prices.  
 
Other Liabilities and Subordinated Debt 
The fair value of these financial liabilities is based on quoted market prices in an active market. If there is no active market, fair value is determined by 
discounting contractual cash flows using the current market interest rates offered for similar financial instruments that have the same term to maturity.

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont.)  
 
Hierarchy of Fair Value Measurements  
 
IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. This 
fair value hierarchy requires observable market inputs to be used whenever such inputs exist. According to the hierarchy, the highest level of inputs are 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and the lowest level of inputs are unobservable inputs. If inputs from different levels of 
the hierarchy are used, the financial instrument is classified in the same level as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The 
fair value hierarchy has the following levels. 
 
—  Level 1: Inputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the 
measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain 
highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.  
—  Level 2:  Valuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the 
market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and 
inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist 
primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain 
equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables and certain other 
liabilities. 
—  Level 3:  Valuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies 
financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The 
valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs. 
 
Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of the following: 
 
—  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss: investments in hedge funds for which there are certain restrictions on unit or security 
redemptions, as well as certain derivative financial instruments whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on 
significant unobservable market inputs. 
—  available-for-sale securities: certain restructured notes as well as equity and debt securities of private companies. 
—  certain deposits (structured deposit notes) whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable 
market inputs. 
 
Transfers Between the Fair Value Hierarchy Levels 
Transfers of financial instruments between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers to (or from) Level 3 are deemed to have taken place at the beginning of the quarter in 
which the transfer occurred. Significant transfers can occur between the fair value hierarchy levels due to new information on inputs used to determine fair 
value and the observable nature of those inputs.  
 
During fiscal 2017, $358 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $17 million in obligations related to securities sold short 
were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 resulting from changing market conditions ($214 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss 
and $71 million in obligations related to securities sold short in fiscal 2016). In addition, during fiscal 2017, $103 million in securities classified as at fair 
value through profit or loss and $53 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (for fiscal 2016, $56 million 
in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and no obligations related to securities sold short). 
 
During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, financial instruments were transferred to (or from) Level 3 due to changes in the availability of observable market inputs 
resulting from changing market conditions.

Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
The Bank classifies financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the 
markets. The valuation technique may also be based, in part, on observable market inputs. The following table shows the significant unobservable inputs 
used for the fair value measurements of financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the hierarchy.

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont.) 
 
Significant Unobservable Inputs Used for Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
Net Asset Value 
Net asset value is the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from the investment or fund managers, the administrators of the conduits or 
the general partners of the limited partnerships. The net asset value of a fund is the total fair value of assets less liabilities. 
 
EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) Multiple and Price Equivalent 
Private equity valuation inputs include earnings multiples, which are determined based on comparable companies, and a higher multiple will translate into a 
higher fair value. Price equivalent is a percentage of the market price based on the liquidity of the security. 
 
Discount Rate 
When discounted cash flow methods are used, the discount rate is the input used to bring future cash flows to their present value. A higher discount rate will 
translate into a lower fair value. 
 
Long-Term Volatility 
Volatility is a measure of the expected future variability of market prices. Volatility is generally observable in the market through options prices. However, the 
long-term volatility of options with a longer maturity might not be observable. An increase (decrease) in long-term volatility is generally associated with an 
increase (decrease) in long-term correlation. Higher long-term volatility may increase or decrease an instrument’s fair value depending on its terms. 
 
Market Correlation 
Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two different variables. A positive correlation means that the variables tend to move in the same 
direction; a negative correlation means that the variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to measure financial instruments whose 
future returns depend on several variables. Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument’s fair value depending on the terms of 
its contractual payout. 
 
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
The Bank performs sensitivity analyses for the fair value measurements of financial instruments classified in Level 3, substituting unobservable inputs with 
one or more reasonably possible alternative assumptions.  
 
For equity securities and other debt securities, the Bank varies significant unobservable inputs such as net asset values, EV/EBITDA multiples, or price 
equivalents and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $40 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at 
October 31, 2017 (a $40 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2016).  
 
For derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives related to structured deposit notes, the Bank varies long-term volatility and market correlation 
inputs and establishes a reasonable fair value range. As at October 31, 2017, for derivative financial instruments, the net fair value could result in a $3 million 
increase or decrease ($7 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2016), whereas for structured deposit notes, the fair value could result in a $1 million 
increase or decrease ($1 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2016).

Change in the Fair Value of Financial Instruments Classified in Level 3 
The Bank may hedge the fair value of financial instruments classified in the various levels through offsetting hedge positions. Gains and losses for financial 
instruments classified in Level 3 presented in the following tables do not reflect the inverse gains and losses on financial instruments used for economic 
hedging purposes that may have been classified in Level 1 or 2 by the Bank. In addition, the Bank may hedge the fair value of financial instruments classified 
in Level 3 using other financial instruments classified in Level 3. The effect of these hedges is not included in the net amount presented in the following tables. 
The gains and losses presented hereafter may comprise changes in fair value based on observable and unobservable inputs.

NOTE 4 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS  
 
The Bank chose to designate certain financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss according to the criteria presented in Note 1. Consistent with its 
risk management strategy and as permitted by the fair value option, when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces the measurement or recognition 
mismatch resulting from measuring financial assets and liabilities on different bases, the Bank designated at fair value through profit or loss certain securities, 
certain securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, and certain 
liabilities related to transferred receivables. The fair value of liabilities related to transferred receivables does not include credit risk, as the holders of these 
liabilities are not exposed to the Bank’s credit risk.  
 
The Bank also designated certain deposits that include embedded derivative financial instruments and certain loans at fair value through profit or loss. There 
is no exposure to credit risk on the loans to the extent that they are fully collateralized. 
 
To determine a change in fair value arising from a change in the credit risk of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank calculates, at 
the beginning of the period, the present value of the instrument’s contractual cash flows using the following rates: first, using an observed discount rate for 
similar securities that reflects the Bank’s credit spread and, then, using a rate that excludes the Bank’s credit spread. The difference obtained between the two 
values is then compared to the difference obtained using the same rates at the end of the period. 
 
Information about the financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the following tables.

(1)  For the year ended October 31, 2017, the change in the fair value of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss attributable to credit risk, and recorded in Other comprehensive 
income, resulted in a $29 million loss (for the year ended October 31, 2016, a net loss of $75 million consisting of a $90 million loss recognized in Other comprehensive income upon early 
prospective adoption of the credit risk provisions set out in IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments on February 1, 2016 and a $15 million gain recognized in Net income). 
(2)  The amount at maturity that the Bank will be contractually required to pay to the holders of these deposits varies and will differ from the reporting date fair value.

NOTE 5 – OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
 
Generally, over-the-counter financial derivatives subject to master netting arrangements of the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. or other 
similar agreements do not meet the netting criteria on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because the right of set-off is legally enforceable only in the event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy. 
 
Generally, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed as well as obligations related to securities sold under 
repurchase agreements and securities loaned, subject to master agreements, do not meet the netting criteria since they confer a right of set-off that is 
enforceable only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.  
 
However, the above-mentioned transactions may be subject to contractual netting agreements concluded with clearing houses. If the netting criteria are met, 
these transactions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, as part of these transactions, the Bank may give or receive cash or other 
financial instruments used as collateral. 
 
The following tables present information on financial assets and financial liabilities that are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because they meet the 
netting criteria and on those that are not netted and are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

Impairment Losses Recognized 
At the end of each financial reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment for each available-for-sale security. 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, a negligible amount ($9 million for the year ended October 31, 2016) for impairment charges was recognized in Gains 
(losses) on available-for-sale securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, during the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, no 
amounts were reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Income to recognize subsequent increases in the fair value of previously impaired debt securities. 
 
Gross Unrealized Losses 
As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank concluded that the gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities were mainly due to market price 
fluctuations and to changes in foreign exchange rates and that there is no objective evidence of impairment requiring an impairment charge to be recognized 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Held-to-Maturity Securities 
 
At the end of each financial reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment for each held-to-maturity security. As at 
October 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no objective evidence of impairment on held-to-maturity securities. 
 
Master Asset Vehicles (MAV) 
 
As at October 31, 2017, the carrying value of the restructured notes of the MAV conduits and of the other restructured notes held by the Bank was nil 
($619 million as at October 31, 2016). The change in the carrying value of the restructured notes of the MAV conduits during the year ended October 31, 2017 
was mainly attributable to capital repayments.

NOTE 8 – FINANCIAL ASSETS TRANSFERRED BUT NOT DERECOGNIZED 
 
In the normal course of its business, the Bank enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets such as securities or loans directly to third parties, 
in particular structured entities. According to the terms of some of those transactions, the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards related to 
those financial assets. The risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk and other price risks, whereas the rewards 
include income streams associated with the financial assets. As such, those financial assets are not derecognized and the transactions are treated as 
collateralized or secured borrowings. The nature of those transactions is described below. 
 
Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned 
When securities are sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned under securities lending agreements, the Bank transfers financial assets to third 
parties in accordance with the standard terms for such transactions. These third parties may have an unlimited right to resell or repledge the financial assets 
received. If cash collateral is received, the Bank records the cash along with an obligation to return the cash, which is included in Obligations related to 
securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are received as collateral, the Bank 
does not record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Financial Assets Transferred to Structured Entities 
Under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program, the Bank sells securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities to Canada Housing 
Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of insured mortgage bonds. Third-party CMB investors have legal recourse only to the 
transferred assets. The cash received for these transferred assets is treated as a secured borrowing, and a corresponding liability is recorded in Liabilities 
related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
The following table provides additional information about the nature of the transferred financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition and the associated 
liabilities.

Fair value of associated liabilities(2)    33,356    35,041   
 
(1)  The amount related to the securities loaned is the maximum amount of Bank securities that can be lent. For the obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, the 
amount includes the Bank’s own financial assets as well as those of third parties. 
(2)  Associated liabilities include obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements before the offsetting impact of $1,621 million as at October 31, 2017 ($3,521 million as at 
October 31, 2016) and liabilities related to transferred receivables. Liabilities related to securities loaned are not included, as the Bank can lend its own financial assets and those of third 
parties. The carrying value and fair value of liabilities related to securities loaned were $10,156 million as at October 31, 2017 ($11,296 million as at October 31, 2016). 
 
The following table specifies the nature of the transactions related to financial assets transferred but not derecognized.

their home jurisdictions.  
 
Maple Bank GmbH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Maple, has been the subject of an investigation into alleged tax irregularities by German 
prosecutors since September 2015 and, to the Bank’s knowledge, that investigation is ongoing. The Bank understands that the investigation is focusing on 
selected trading activities by Maple Bank GmbH and some of its current and former employees during taxation years 2006 to 2010, although the Bank has 
been advised that the investigation may also extend to subsequent taxation years. The German authorities have alleged that these trading activities violated 
German tax laws. Neither the Bank nor its employees were involved in these trading activities and, to the Bank’s knowledge, are not the subject of this 
investigation. 
 
On February 6, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple Bank GmbH, 
preventing it from carrying out its normal business activities. In light of the situation, the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity interest in Maple in an 
amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income taxes) during the first quarter of 2016. The $164 million write-off of the equity interest in this associate 
was recognized in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2016 and was reported in the 
Financial Markets segment. 
 
The Bank has advised the German authorities that if it is determined that portions of dividends received from Maple could be reasonably attributable to tax 
fraud by Maple Bank GmbH, arrangements will be made to repay those amounts to the relevant authority. If any repayments are required, they are not 
expected to be material to the Bank’s financial position.

(1)  Constitutes a CGU. 
(2)  During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, acquired Groupe Financier Abi-Témi inc. located in Rouyn-Noranda, Canada. 
 
Goodwill Impairment Testing and Significant Assumptions 
For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting from a business combination must be allocated to a CGU or a group of CGUs 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable value of the CGU or group of CGUs may have fallen below its carrying amount. 
 
Goodwill was tested for impairment during the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, and no impairment loss was recognized. 
 
The recoverable value of a CGU or group of CGUs is based on the value in use that is calculated based on discounted pre-tax cash flows. Future pre-tax cash 
flows are estimated based on a five-year period, which is the reference period used for the most recent financial forecasts approved by management. Cash 
flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate. 
 
The discount rate used for each CGU or group of CGUs is calculated using the cost of debt financing and the cost related to the Bank’s equity. This rate 
corresponds to the Bank’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risk specific to the CGU. The long-term growth rate used in calculating discounted 
cash flow estimates is based on the forecasted growth rate plus a risk premium. The rate is constant over the entire five-year period for which the cash flows 
were determined. Growth rates are determined, among other factors, based on past growth rates, economic trends, inflation, competition and the impact of the 
Bank’s strategic initiatives. As at October 31, 2017, for each CGU or CGU group, the discount rate used was 13.2% (12.3% as at October 31, 2016) and the 
long-term growth rate was between 2.0% and 5.0% depending on the CGU as at October 31, 2017 and 2016. 
 
Estimating a CGU’s value in use requires significant judgment regarding the inputs used in applying the discounted cash flow method. The Bank conducts 
sensitivity analyses by varying the after-tax discount rate and the terminal growth rates upward by 1%; such sensitivity analyses would not increase a CGU’s 
carrying value above its value in use.

Covered Bonds 
NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership 
In December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond 
Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold 
uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. During the year ended October 31, 2017, 
the Bank issued covered bonds under this program in an amount of 150 million pounds sterling (covered bonds in amounts of 750 million euros and 
100 million pounds sterling issued during the year ended October 31, 2016). The covered bonds totalled $7.0 billion as at October 31, 2017 ($6.7 billion as at 
October 31, 2016). See Note 28 for additional information. 
 
The Bank has limited access to the assets owned by this structured entity according to the terms of the agreements that apply to this transaction. The assets 
owned by this entity totalled $15.9 billion as at October 31, 2017 ($14.2 billion as at October 31, 2016), of which $15.6 billion ($13.9 billion as at 
October 31, 2016) is presented in Residential mortgage loans on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 15 – RESTRUCTURING  
 
During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the Board approved certain restructuring initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan, satisfy the changing needs of its 
clients and enhance operational efficiency. This transformation will allow the Bank to maintain the pace of its client-centric shift, pursue the transition to 
digital banking, maintain a compelling workplace and focus on operational excellence. 
 
During fiscal 2016, the Bank recorded a charge of $131 million in the Restructuring charge item of the Consolidated Statement of Income, consisting of 
severance pay and onerous contracts. This restructuring charge was reported in the Other heading of the segment disclosures.

NOTE 17 – DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Derivative financial instruments are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying interest rate, exchange rate, or equity, commodity or credit 
instrument or index. 
 
The main types of derivative financial instruments used are presented below. 
 
Forwards and Futures 
Forwards and futures are contractual obligations to buy or deliver a specified amount of currency, interest rate, commodity or financial instrument on a 
specified future date at a specified price. Forwards are tailor-made agreements transacted in the over-the-counter market. Futures are traded on organized 
exchanges and are subject to cash margining calculated daily by clearing houses. 
 
Swaps 
Swaps are over-the-counter contracts in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows. The Bank uses the following types of swap contracts: 
 
—  Cross-currency swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed-rate interest payments and principal payments in different currencies. 
—  Interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate interest payments, based on the notional principal value in 
the same currency. 
—  Commodity swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate payments, based on the notional principal value of a 
commodity. 
—  Equity swaps are transactions in which counterparties agree to exchange the return on one equity or group of equities for a payment based on a 
benchmark interest rate. 
—  Credit default swaps are transactions in which one of the parties agrees to pay returns to the other party so that the latter can make a payment if a credit 
event occurs. 
 
Options  
Options are agreements between two parties in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell, either at a 
specified date or dates or at any time prior to a predetermined expiry date, a specific amount of currency, commodity or financial instrument at an agreed-upon 
price upon the sale of the option. The writer receives a premium for the sale of this instrument.

Credit Risk   
Credit risk on derivative financial instruments is the risk of financial loss that the Bank will have to assume if a counterparty fails to honour its contractual 
obligations. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is subject to the same credit approval, credit limit and monitoring standards as those applied 
to the Bank’s other credit transactions. Consequently, the Bank evaluates the creditworthiness of counterparties and monitors the size of the portfolios as well 
as the diversification and maturity profiles of these financial instruments. 
 
The Bank limits the credit risk of over-the-counter contracts by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and entering into contracts that provide for the 
exchange of collateral between parties where the fair value of the outstanding transactions exceeds an agreed threshold. The Bank also negotiates master 
netting agreements that provide for the simultaneous close-out and settling of all transactions with a given counterparty in the event of default, insolvency or 
bankruptcy. However, overall exposure to credit risk, reduced through master netting agreements, may change substantially after the balance sheet date 
because it is affected by all transactions subject to a contract as well as by changes in the market rates of the underlying instruments. 
 
The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to have access to established clearing houses in order to minimize the settlement risk for certain financial 
derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank has direct access to clearing houses for settling derivative financial instruments. In addition, certain 
derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties. 
 
In the case of exchange-traded contracts, exposure to credit risk is limited because these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established 
exchanges, each of which is associated with a well-capitalized clearing house that assumes the obligations of both counterparties and guarantees their 
performance obligations. All exchange-traded contracts are subject to initial margins and daily settlement. 
 
Terms Used 
Replacement Cost 
Replacement cost is the Bank’s maximum credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This amount 
is the positive fair value of all over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, before all master netting agreements and collateral held. 
 
Credit Risk Equivalent 
The credit risk equivalent amount is the total replacement cost plus an amount representing the potential future credit risk exposure, as outlined in OSFI’s 
Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline. 
 
Risk-Weighted Amount 
The risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the OSFI guidance to the credit risk equivalent.

Fair Value Hedges 
Fair value hedge transactions consist of using interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability caused by interest 
rate fluctuations. Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments offset changes in the fair value of the hedged 
item. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to portfolios of available-for-sale securities, fixed-rate deposits, liabilities related to transferred receivables and 
subordinated debt.

Cash Flow Hedges 
Cash flow hedge transactions consist of using interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows caused by floating-rate assets or liabilities. 
The Bank applies this strategy mainly to loan, personal credit line, acceptance and deposit portfolios. The Bank also uses total return swaps to hedge the risk 
of changes in future cash flows related to the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan. Some of these swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge against a 
portion of the unrecognized obligation of the RSU Plan. In a cash flow hedge, the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments reduce the

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations 
The Bank’s structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The Bank 
measures this risk by assessing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and hedges it using financial instruments (derivative or non-derivative). In a hedge 
of a net investment in a foreign operation, the financial instruments used offset foreign exchange gains and losses on the investments. When non-derivative 
financial instruments are designated as foreign exchange risk hedges, only the changes in fair value that are attributable to foreign exchange risk are taken 
into account in assessing and calculating the effectiveness of the hedge. 
 
For the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, a negligible amount representing the ineffective portion was recognized in Non-interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

(1)  Redeemable in cash at the Bank’s option, in whole or in part, subject to the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) and to OSFI approval. Redemption prices are increased by all the declared 
and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares to the date fixed for redemption. 
(2)  Convertible at the option of the holders of first preferred shares, subject to certain conditions. 
(3)  The dividends are non-cumulative and payable quarterly, except for Series 19 and 23, for which the dividends are payable semi-annually. 
(4)  Redeemable as of the date fixed for redemption and on the same date every five years thereafter. 
(5)  Convertible as of the date fixed for conversion and on the same date every five years thereafter, subject to certain conditions. 
(6)  The dividend amount is set for the initial period ending on the date fixed for redemption. Thereafter, these shares carry a non-cumulative quarterly fixed dividend in an amount per share 
determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the sum of the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield on the applicable fixed-rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset 
premium. 
(7)  Upon the occurrence of a trigger event as defined by OSFI, each outstanding preferred share will be automatically and immediately converted, on a full and permanent basis, without the 
consent of the holder, into a number of common shares of the Bank determined pursuant to an automatic conversion formula. This conversion will be calculated by dividing the value of the 
preferred shares, i.e., $25.00 per share, plus all declared and unpaid dividends as at the date of the trigger event, by the value of the common shares. The value of the common shares will 
be the greater of a $5.00 floor price or the current market price of the common shares. Current market price means the volume weighted average trading price of common shares for the ten 
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the 
price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank’s Board. 
(8)  For additional information, see Note 20.  
(9)  As of the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price will be $25.50 per share. Thereafter, on the same date every five years, the redemption price will be $25.00 per share. 
(10)  The dividend period begins as of the date fixed for redemption. The amount of the floating quarterly non-cumulative dividend is determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the 
sum of the 90-day Government of Canada treasury bill yield on the floating rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset premium.

On June 13, 2017, the Bank issued 16,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 38 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share for 
gross proceeds of $400 million. Given that the Series 38 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
On June 13, 2016, the Bank had issued 16,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 36 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share for 
gross proceeds of $400 million. Given that the Series 36 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
On January 22, 2016, the Bank had issued 16,000,000 Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 34 First Preferred Shares at a price equal to $25.00 per share 
for gross proceeds of $400 million. Given that the Series 34 preferred shares satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the 
purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. 
 
Redemption of Preferred Shares 
On August 29, 2017, the Board approved the redemption, on November 15, 2017, of all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset 
Series 28 First Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the share conditions, the redemption price was $25.00 per share plus the periodic dividend declared and unpaid. 
The Bank redeemed 8,000,000 Series 28 preferred shares for a total amount of $200 million on November 15, 2017.

Repurchases of Common Shares 
On June 5, 2017, the Bank began a normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 6,000,000 common shares over the 12-month period ending 
no later than June 4, 2018. Any repurchase through the Toronto Stock Exchange will be done at market prices. The amounts that will be paid above the average 
book value of the common shares will be charged to Retained earnings. During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank repurchased 2,000,000 common 
shares for $115 million, which reduced Common share capital by $16 million and Retained earnings by $99 million. 
 
Reserved Common Shares 
As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, 15,507,568 common shares were reserved under the Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan. As at 
October 31, 2017, 25,764,866 common shares (21,003,961 as at October 31, 2016) were reserved under the Stock Option Plan. 
 
Common Shares Held in Escrow 
As part of the acquisition of Wellington West Holdings Inc. in 2011, the Bank had issued common shares held in escrow. In December 2016, 799,563 of these 
shares were released to shareholders. In addition, 108,341 shares were cancelled, mainly upon the settlement of certain indemnifications guaranteed by 
those shares. As at October 31, 2017, the number of common shares held in escrow was 28,881 (936,785 as at October 31, 2016). The Bank expects that the 
remaining shares in escrow will be settled by the end of calendar year 2018. 
 
Restriction on the Payment of Dividends  
The Bank is prohibited from declaring dividends on its common or preferred shares if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Bank would, by so 
doing, be in contravention of the regulations of the Bank Act (Canada) or OSFI’s capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. In addition, the ability to pay 
common share dividends is restricted by the terms of the outstanding preferred shares pursuant to which the Bank may not pay dividends on its common 
shares without the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, unless all preferred share dividends have been declared and paid or set aside 
for payment. Moreover, if NBC Asset Trust were unable to pay the full amount of distributions on the trust units, the Bank would withhold from declaring 
dividends on any of its preferred and common shares during a determined period. For additional information, see Notes 20 and 28. 
 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
The Bank has a dividend reinvestment plan for common and preferred shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional. Under the terms and conditions of the 
plan, participants acquire shares through the reinvestment of cash dividends paid on the shares they hold or through optional cash payments. Common shares 
subscribed by participants are purchased on their behalf in the secondary market through the Bank’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, 
at a price equal to the average purchase price of the common shares during the ten business days immediately following the dividend payment date.

Trust Units Issued by NBC Asset Trust 
Through structured entity NBC Asset Trust (the Trust), a closed-end trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario, the Bank issued transferable 
non-voting trust units called “Trust Capital Securities” or “NBC CapS II.” These securities are not redeemable or exchangeable for Bank preferred shares at the 
option of the holder. The gross proceeds from the issuance were used by the Trust to finance the acquisition of mortgage loans from the Bank. For additional 
information, see Note 28.

(2)  For each distribution date after June 30, 2018, the distribution will be paid at a rate equal to one-half the sum of the 180-day bankers’ acceptance rate in effect plus 3.79%. 
(3)  For each distribution date after June 30, 2020, the distribution will be paid at a rate equal to one-half the sum of the 180-day bankers’ acceptance rate in effect plus 4.09%. 
 
Distribution 
No cash distributions will be payable by the Trust on NBC CapS II if the Bank fails to declare regular dividends on its preferred shares or, if no preferred shares 
are then outstanding, on its outstanding common shares. In this case, the net distributable funds of the Trust will be paid to the Bank as the sole holder of the 
special trust securities, representing the residual interest in the Trust. Should the Trust fail to pay the semi-annual distributions in full on the NBC CapS II, the 
Bank will withhold from declaring dividends on any of its preferred and common shares during a determined period. 
 
Automatic Exchange 
Each NBC CapS II – Series 1 can be exchanged automatically, without the consent of the holders, for 40 Series 19 First Preferred Shares of the Bank, and each 
NBC CapS II – Series 2 can be exchanged automatically, without the consent of the holders, for 40 Series 23 First Preferred Shares of the Bank upon the 
occurrence of one of the following events: (i) proceedings are commenced for the winding-up of the Bank; (ii) OSFI takes control of the Bank; (iii) the Bank posts 
a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 5% or a Total capital ratio of less than 8%; or (iv) OSFI has directed the Bank to increase its capital or to provide additional 
liquidity and the Bank elects such automatic exchange or the Bank fails to comply with such direction to the satisfaction of OSFI. On an automatic exchange, 
the Bank will hold all outstanding trust capital securities of the Trust. 
 
Redemption at the Option of the Trust 
On any distribution date, the Trust may, subject to prior written notice and OSFI approval, redeem, at its option, the NBC CapS II – Series 1 and Series 2, in 
whole but not in part, without the consent of the holders.  
 
Purchase for Cancellation 
The Trust may, with OSFI approval, purchase NBC CapS II – Series 1 and Series 2, in whole or in part, on the open market or by tender or private contract at any 
price. The NBC CapS II purchased by the Trust, if any, will be cancelled and will not be reissued. 
 
Regulatory Capital 
The NBC CapS II – Series 1 and Series 2 qualify as innovative capital instruments and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do 
not satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be phased out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022.

NOTE 21 – CAPITAL DISCLOSURE 
 
Capital Management Objectives, Policies and Procedures 
Capital management has a dual role of ensuring a competitive return to the Bank’s shareholders while maintaining a solid capital foundation that covers the 
risks inherent to the Bank’s business, supports its business segments and protects its clients. 
 
The Bank’s capital management policy defines the guiding principles as well as the roles and responsibilities regarding its internal capital adequacy 
assessment process. This process is a key tool in establishing the Bank’s capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments. 
 
Capital Management 
Capital ratios are obtained by dividing regulatory capital by risk-weighted assets and are expressed as a percentage. Risk-weighted assets are calculated in 
accordance with the rules established by OSFI for on- and off-balance-sheet risks. Credit, market and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted 
assets calculation for regulatory purposes. The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types 
of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, intangible assets and other capital deductions. The 
Additional Tier 1 instruments comprise eligible non-cumulative preferred shares and the eligible amount of innovative instruments. The sum of CET1 and 
Additional Tier 1 capital form what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of the eligible portion of subordinated debt and certain loan loss 
allowances. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
 
The Basel III regulatory framework sets out transitional arrangements for the period of 2013 to 2019. However, OSFI is requiring Canadian banks to meet the 
2019 minimum “all-in” requirements rather than the minimum ratios calculated using the transitional methodology. The “all-in” methodology includes all of 
the regulatory adjustments that will be required by 2019 while retaining the phase-out rules for non-qualifying capital instruments. Consequently, the Bank 
and all other major Canadian banks have had to maintain, on an "all-in" basis, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, and a 
Total capital ratio of at least 11.5%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a 1% surcharge applicable to Domestic 
Systemically Important Banks. 
 
OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is 
calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative 
exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total 
exposure. 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2017 and 2016, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI’s regulatory capital requirements.

Stock Option Plan 
The Bank’s Stock Option Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this plan, options are awarded annually and 
provide participants with the right to purchase common shares at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange on the day preceding the award. The options vest evenly over a four-year period and expire ten years from the award date or, in certain 
circumstances set out in the plan, within specified time limits. The Stock Option Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s 
rights to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement. The maximum number of common shares that may be issued under the 
Stock Option Plan was 25,764,866 as at October 31, 2017 (21,003,961 as at October 31, 2016). The number of common shares reserved for a participant may 
not exceed 5% of the total number of Bank shares issued and outstanding.

NOTE 23 – SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (cont.) 
 
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily representative of how options will be exercised in the future. Expected 
volatility is extrapolated from the implied volatility of the Bank’s share price and observable market inputs, which are not necessarily representative of actual 
results. The expected dividend yield represents the annualized dividend divided by the Bank’s share price at the award date. The risk-free interest rate is based 
on the Canadian dollar swap curve at the award date. The exercise price is equal to the Bank’s share price at the award date. No other market parameter has 
been included in the fair value measurement of the options. 
 
The compensation expense recorded for this plan for the year ended October 31, 2017 was $11 million ($12 million for the year ended October 31, 2016). 
 
Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan 
The SAR Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this plan, participants receive, upon exercising the right, a 
cash amount equal to the difference between the closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the exercise 
date and the closing price on the day preceding the award date. SARs vest evenly over a four-year period and expire 10 years after the award date or, in certain 
circumstances set out in the plan, within specified time limits. The SAR Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s rights to 
continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement. A compensation expense of $4 million was recognized for the year ended 
October 31, 2017 with respect to this plan ($1 million for the year ended October 31, 2016).

Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plans 
The DSU Plans are for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries as well as directors. These plans allow the Bank to tie a portion of 
the value of the compensation of participants to the future value of the Bank’s common shares. A DSU is a right that has a value equal to the closing price of a 
common share of the Bank on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the award. DSUs generally vest evenly over four years. Additional DSUs are 
credited to the participant’s account equal in amount to the dividends paid on common shares of the Bank and vest evenly over the same period as the 
reference DSUs. DSUs may only be cashed when participants retire or leave the Bank, or for directors, when their term ends. The DSU Plan contains provisions 
for retiring employees that allow the participant’s units to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank awarded 74,436 DSUs at a weighted average price of $54.69 (79,098 DSUs at a weighted average price of 
$42.17 for the year ended October 31, 2016). A total of 637,989 DSUs were outstanding as at October 31, 2017 (688,035 DSUs as at October 31, 2016). A 
compensation expense of $14 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2017 with respect to these plans ($9 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2016).

Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan 
The RSU Plan is for certain officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. The objective of this plan is to ensure that the compensation 
of certain officers and other designated persons is competitive and to foster retention. An RSU represents a right that has a value equal to the average closing 
price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December. RSUs 
generally vest evenly over three years, although some RSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the third year following the date of the award, the 
date on which all RSUs expire. Additional RSUs are credited to the participant’s account equal in amount to the dividends declared on the common shares of 
the Bank and vest evenly over the same period as the reference RSUs. The RSU Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s units 
to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank awarded 2,411,016 RSUs at a weighted average price of $51.21 (2,631,545 RSUs at a weighted average 
price of $43.43 for the year ended October 31, 2016). As at October 31, 2017, a total of 5,156,316 RSUs were outstanding (5,205,269 RSUs as at October 31, 
2016). A compensation expense of $174 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2017 with respect to the Plan ($122 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2016). 
 
Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan 
The PSU Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank. The objective of this plan is to tie a portion of the value of the compensation of these 
officers and other designated persons to the future value of the Bank’s common shares. A PSU represents a right that has a value equal to the average closing 
price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December, 
adjusted upward or downward according to performance criteria, which is based on the total shareholder return (TSR) over three years achieved by the Bank 
compared to that of the S&P/TSX Banks adjusted sub-index. PSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the third year following the date of the award, 
the date on which all PSUs expire. Additional PSUs are credited to the participant’s account in an amount equal to the dividends declared on the Bank’s 
common shares and vest evenly over the same period as the reference PSUs. The PSU Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the 
participant’s units to continue vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank awarded 345,237 PSUs at a weighted average price of $51.21 (364,163 PSUs at a weighted average price of 
$43.43 for the year ended October 31, 2016). As at October 31, 2017, a total of 881,701 PSUs were outstanding (781,846 PSUs as at October 31, 2016). A 
compensation expense of $24 million was recognized for the year ended October 31, 2017 with respect to the Plan ($15 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2016). 
 
Deferred Compensation Plan of National Bank Financial (NBF) 
This plan is exclusively for key employees of NBF Wealth Management. The purpose of this plan is to foster the retention of key employees and promote the 
growth in income and the continuous improvement in profitability at Wealth Management. Under this plan, participants can defer a portion of their annual 
compensation and NBF may pay a contribution to key employees when certain financial objectives are met. Amounts awarded by NBF and the compensation 
deferred by participants are invested in, among others, Bank common share units. These share units represent a right, the value of which corresponds to the 
closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the award date. Additional units are paid to the participant’s account equal in 
amount to the dividends declared on the Bank’s common shares. Share units representing the amounts awarded by NBF vest evenly over four years. When a 
participant retires, or in certain cases when the participant’s employment is terminated, the participant receives a cash amount representing the value of the 
vested share units.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2017, NBF awarded 132,226 share units at a weighted average price of $55.36 (163,845 share units at a weighted average 
price of $42.05 for the year ended October 31, 2016). As at October 31, 2017, 1,598,966 share units were outstanding (1,569,501 share units as at 
October 31, 2016). During the year ended October 31, 2017, a $24 million compensation expense was recognized for this Plan ($13 million for the year ended 
October 31, 2016). 
 
Employee Share Ownership Plan 
Under the Bank’s Employee Share Ownership Plan, employees who meet the eligibility criteria can contribute up to 8% of their annual gross salary by way of 
payroll deductions. The Bank matches 25% of the employee contribution up to a maximum of $1,500 per annum. Bank contributions vest to the employee after 
one year of uninterrupted participation in the plan. Subsequent contributions vest immediately. The Bank’s contributions, amounting to $10 million for the 
year ended October 31, 2017 ($10 million for the year ended October 31, 2016), were charged to Compensation and employee benefits when paid. As at 
October 31, 2017, a total of 5,961,203 common shares were held for this plan (6,359,681 common shares as at October 31, 2016). 
 
Plan shares are purchased on the open market and are considered to be outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Dividends paid on the Bank’s 
common shares held for the Employee Share Ownership Plan are used to purchase other common shares on the open market. 
 
Plan Liabilities and Intrinsic Value 
Total liabilities arising from the Bank’s share-based compensation plans amounted to $511 million as at October 31, 2017 ($391 million as at 
October 31, 2016). The intrinsic value of these liabilities that had vested as at October 31, 2017 was $223 million ($186 million as at October 31, 2016).

NOTE 24 – EMPLOYEE BENEFITS – PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
 
The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The pension plans provide benefits based on 
years of plan participation and average earnings at retirement. The other post-employment benefit plans include post-retirement medical, dental and life 
insurance coverage. The pension plans are funded whereas the other plans are not funded. The fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation are measured as at October 31. 
 
The Bank’s most significant pension plan is the Employee Pension Plan of the National Bank of Canada; it is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue 
Agency and subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the Income Tax Act. 
 
The defined benefit plans expose the Bank to specific risks such as investment performance, changes to the discount rate used to calculate the obligation, the 
longevity of plan members and future inflation. While management believes that the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation process are reasonable, there 
remains a degree of risk and uncertainty that may cause future results to differ significantly from these assumptions, which could give rise to gains or losses. 
 
According to the Bank’s governance rules, the policies and risk management related to the defined benefit plans are overseen at different levels by the pension 
committees, the Bank’s management and the Board’s Human Resources Committee. The defined benefit plans are examined on an ongoing basis in order to 
monitor the funding and investment policies, the plans’ financial status and the Bank’s funding requirements. 
 
The Bank’s funding policy for the defined benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by pension regulators.  
 
For funded plans, the Bank determines whether an economic benefit exists in the form of potential reductions in future contributions and in the form of refunds 
from the plan surplus, where permitted by applicable regulations and plan provisions.

The Bank’s investment strategy for plan assets considers several factors, including the time horizon of pension plan obligations and investment risk. For each 
plan, an allocation range per asset class is defined using a mix of equity and debt securities to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets and minimize 
asset/liability mismatching. 
 
The pension plan assets may include investment securities issued by the Bank. As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, the pension plan assets do not include any 
securities issued by the Bank. 
 
For fiscal 2017, the Bank and its related entities received $6 million ($6 million in fiscal 2016) in fees from the pension plans for related management, 
administration and custodial services.

Significant Actuarial Assumptions (Weighted Average)  
 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate assumption is based on an interest rate curve that represents the yields on corporate AA bonds. Short-term maturities are obtained using a 
curve based on observed data from corporate AA bonds. Long-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data and extrapolated data. 
 
In order to measure the pension plan and other post-employment plan obligation, the vested benefits that the Bank expects to pay in each future period are 
discounted to the measurement date using the spot rate associated with each of the respective periods based on the yield curve derived using the above 
methodology. The sum of discounted benefit amounts represents the defined benefit obligation. An average discount rate that replicates this obligation is then 
computed.  
 
To better reflect current service cost, a separate discount rate was determined to account for the timing of future benefit payments associated with the 
additional year of service to be earned by the plan’s active participants. Since these benefits are, on average, being paid at a later date than the benefits 
already earned by participants as a whole (i.e., longer duration), this method results in the use of a generally higher discount rate for calculating current 
service cost than that used to measure obligations where the yield curve is positively sloped. The methodology used to determine this discount rate is the 
same as the one used to establish the discount rate for measuring the obligation.

Other Assumptions 
For measurement purposes, the estimated annual growth rate for health care costs was 5.28% for 2017 (5.77% for 2016). Based on the assumption retained, 
this rate is expected to decrease gradually to 2.97% in 2034 and remain steady thereafter.  
 
The mortality assumption is a determining factor when measuring the defined benefit obligation. Determining the expected benefit payout period is based on 
best estimate assumptions regarding mortality. Mortality tables are reviewed at least once a year, and the assumptions made are in accordance with accepted 
actuarial practice. New results regarding the plans are reviewed and used in calculating best estimates of future mortality.

Notice of Assessment 
  
In March 2017, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issued a proposed reassessment to the Bank for the 2011 and 2012 taxation years. In May 2017, the CRA 
reassessed the Bank for the 2012 taxation year. The transactions to which the proposed reassessment and the actual reassessment relate are similar to those 
prospectively addressed by the synthetic equity arrangement rules introduced in the 2015 Canadian federal budget. The proposed reassessment and the 
actual reassessment (including estimated provincial income taxes and interest) total approximately $173 million. The CRA may issue reassessments to the 
Bank in respect of similar activities for fiscal years subsequent to 2012. The Bank is confident that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously 
defend its position. As a result, no amount has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2017.

NOTE 27 – GUARANTEES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 
Guarantees 
 
The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the maximum risk of loss if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without 
consideration of recoveries under recourse provisions, insurance policies or from collateral held or pledged. The maximum potential amount of future 
payments for significant guarantees issued by the Bank is presented in the following table. 
  
As at October 31    2017   2016  
         
Letters of guarantee    3,847   3,125  
Backstop liquidity, credit enhancement facilities and other    5,049   5,969  
Securities lending    1,293   982  
 
Letters of Guarantee 
In the normal course of business, the Bank issues letters of guarantee. These letters of guarantee represent irrevocable commitments that the Bank will make 
payments in the event that a client cannot meet its financial obligations to third parties. The Bank’s policy for requiring collateral security with respect to 
letters of guarantee is similar to that for loans. Generally, the term of these letters of guarantee is less than two years. The collective allowance on 
non-impaired loans covers all credit risks, including those relating to letters of guarantee. As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, no amount has been recorded on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to these letters of guarantee. 
 
Backstop Liquidity and Credit Enhancement Facilities 
Facilities to Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing asset-backed commercial paper. 
The Bank provides backstop liquidity facilities to these multi-seller conduits. As at October 31, 2017, the notional amount of the global-style backstop liquidity 
facilities totalled $2.7 billion ($2.9 billion as at October 31, 2016), representing the total amount of the commercial paper outstanding. 
 
These backstop liquidity facilities can be drawn if the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market, even if there is no general market 
disruption. These facilities have terms of less than one year and can be periodically renewed. The terms and conditions of these backstop liquidity facilities do 
not require the Bank to advance money to the conduits if the conduits are insolvent or involved in bankruptcy proceedings or to fund non-performing assets 
beyond the amount of the available credit enhancements. The backstop liquidity facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn to date.  
 
The Bank also provides credit enhancement facilities to these multi-seller conduits. These facilities have terms of less than one year and are automatically 
renewable unless the Bank sends a non-renewal notice. As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, the committed notional value for these facilities was $30 million. To 
date, the credit enhancement facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn. 
 
The maximum risk of loss for the Bank cannot exceed the total amount of commercial paper outstanding, i.e., $2.7 billion as at October 31, 2017 ($2.9 billion 
as at October 31, 2016). As at October 31, 2017, the Bank held $6 million ($4 million as at October 31, 2016) of this commercial paper and, consequently, the 
maximum potential amount of future payments was $2.7 billion ($2.9 billion as at October 31, 2016). 
 
CDCC Overnight Liquidity Facility 
Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC) acts as a central clearing counterparty for multiple financial instrument transactions in Canada. Certain 
fixed-income clearing members of CDCC have provided an equally shared committed and uncommitted global overnight liquidity facility for the purpose of 
supporting CDCC in its clearing activities of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements or sold under repurchase agreements. The objective of 
this facility is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event of a clearing member’s default. As a fixed-income clearing member providing support to CDCC, the 
Bank provides a liquidity facility. As at October 31, 2017, the notional amount of the overnight uncommitted liquidity facility amounted to $2.3 billion 
($2.3 billion as at October 31, 2016). As at October 31, 2017 and 2016, no amount had been drawn.

Securities Lending 
Under securities lending agreements the Bank has entered into with certain clients who have entrusted it with the safekeeping of their securities, the Bank 
lends the securities to third parties and indemnifies its clients in the event of loss. In order to protect itself against any contingent loss, the Bank obtains, as 
security from the borrower, a cash amount or extremely liquid marketable securities with a fair value greater than that of the securities loaned. No amount has 
been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to potential indemnities resulting from securities lending agreements. 
  
Other Indemnification Agreements 
In the normal course of business, including securitization transactions and discontinuances of businesses and operations, the Bank enters into numerous 
contractual agreements under which it undertakes to compensate the counterparty for costs incurred as a result of litigation, changes in laws and regulations 
(including tax legislation), claims with respect to past performance, incorrect representations or the non-performance of certain restrictive covenants. The Bank 
also undertakes to indemnify any person acting as a director or officer or performing a similar function within the Bank or one of its subsidiaries or another 
entity, at the request of the Bank, for all expenses incurred by that person in proceedings or investigations to which he or she is party in that capacity. 
Moreover, as a member of a securities transfer network and pursuant to the membership agreement and the regulations governing the operation of the 
network, the Bank granted a movable hypothec to the network that can be used in the event another member fails to meet its contractual obligations. The 
durations of the indemnification agreements vary according to circumstance; as at October 31, 2017 and 2016, given the nature of the agreements, the Bank is 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential liability it could be required to pay to counterparties. No amount has been recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to these agreements. 
 
Master Asset Vehicles (MAV) 
Margin Funding Facility 
During fiscal 2017, given the repayment of the restructured notes, the Bank ceased its commitment to contribute to the margin funding facility of the MAV 
conduits. As at October 31, 2016, the Bank had committed to contribute $800 million to a margin funding facility related to the MAV conduits in order to 
finance potential collateral calls, and no amount had been advanced.  
 
Commitments 
 
Credit Instruments 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the financing needs of its 
clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn. 
  
As at October 31    2017    2016  
          
Letters of guarantee(1)    3,847   3,125  
Documentary letters of credit(2)    137   136  
Credit card receivables(3)    7,688   7,187  
Commitments to extend credit(3)    52,391   47,815  
 
(1)  See the Letters of Guarantee heading on page 184. 
(2)  Documentary letters of credit are documents issued by the Bank and used in international trade to enable a third party to draw drafts on the Bank up to an amount established under specific 
terms and conditions; these instruments are collateralized by the delivery of the goods to which they are related. 
(3)  Credit card receivables and commitments to extend credit represent the undrawn portions of credit authorizations granted in the form of loans, acceptances, letters of guarantee and 
documentary letters of credit. The Bank is required at all times to make the undrawn portion of the credit authorization available, subject to certain conditions. 
 
Financial Assets Received as Collateral 
As at October 31, 2017, the fair value of financial assets received as collateral that the Bank was authorized to sell or repledge was $92.2 billion ($71.3 billion 
as at October 31, 2016). These financial assets received as collateral consist of securities related to securities financing and derivative transactions as well as 
securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed. 
 
Other Commitments  
The Bank acts as an investor in investment banking activities where it enters into agreements to finance external private equity funds and investments in 
equity and debt securities at market value at the time the agreements are signed. In connection with these activities, the Bank has commitments to invest up to 
$77 million as at October 31, 2017 ($37 million as at October 31, 2016).

Contingent Liabilities 
 
Litigation 
In the normal course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating, among other matters, to loan portfolios, investment 
portfolios and supplier agreements, including court proceedings, investigations or claims of a regulatory nature, class actions or other legal remedies of varied 
natures. The recent developments in the main legal proceeding involving the Bank are as follows: 
 
Watson 
In 2011, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa Corporation Canada (Visa), MasterCard International Incorporated 
(MasterCard) as well as National Bank and a number of other financial institutions. The plaintiff is alleging that the credit card networks and financial 
institutions engaged in a price-fixing system to increase or maintain the fees paid by merchants on Visa and MasterCard transactions. In so doing, they would 
have been in breach of the Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. During the year ended 
October 31, 2017, the Bank entered into an agreement-in-principle with the plaintiffs in order to settle this dispute in the five jurisdictions where the class 
action was filed. This agreement is subject to the approval of the Court in each of those jurisdictions. 
 
It is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based 
on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a 
material impact on the Bank’s consolidated operating income for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank’s consolidated 
financial position.

NOTE 28 – STRUCTURED ENTITIES 
 
A structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant 
factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means 
of contractual arrangements. Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting treatment described in Note 1. The Bank’s 
maximum exposure to loss resulting from its interests in these structured entities consists primarily of the investments in these entities, the fair value of 
derivative financial instrument contracts entered into with them, and the backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities granted to certain structured 
entities.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities, including commercial loans, reverse 
repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the 
counterparty credit risk of the structured entities, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither 
power nor significant variable returns resulting from financing transactions with structured entities and does not consolidate such entities. Financing 
transactions with third-party-sponsored structured entities are included in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and are not included in the table 
accompanying this note. 
 
Non-Consolidated Structured Entities  
Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the 
assets acquired. Clients use these multi-seller conduits to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial 
assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The 
Bank acts as a financial agent and provides these conduits with administrative and transaction structuring services as well as backstop liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Note 27. The Bank has concluded derivative 
financial instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the Bank has the 
ability to direct the relevant activities of these conduits, it cannot use its power to affect the amount of the returns it obtains, as it acts as an agent. 
Consequently, the Bank does not control these conduits and does not consolidate them.   
 
Master Asset Vehicles (MAV) 
The MAVs are structured entities created for the purpose of grouping the restructured notes stemming from asset-backed commercial paper held by Canadian 
corporate investors. The Bank held economic interests in MAVs in the form of restructured notes and the margin funding facility. The Bank did not have the 
ability to direct the relevant activities of the MAVs. Consequently, it did not control these MAVs and did not consolidate them. During fiscal 2017, the 
restructured notes were repaid and the Bank ceased its commitment to contribute to the margin funding facility of the MAV conduits. 
 
Investment Funds 
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in 
certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. The Bank does not control the funds where its holdings are not significant as in these circumstances, 
the Bank either acts only as an agent or does not have any power over the relevant activities. In both cases, it does not have significant exposure to the 
variable returns of the funds. Therefore, the Bank does not consolidate these funds. 
 
Private Investments 
As part of its investment banking operations, the Bank invests in several limited liability partnerships and other incorporated entities. These investment 
companies in turn invest in operating companies with a view to reselling these investments at a profit over the medium or long term. The Bank does not 
intervene in the operations of these entities; its only role is that of an investor. Consequently, it does not control these companies and does not consolidate 
them.   
 
Asset-Backed Structured Entities 
The Bank invested in certain asset-backed structured entities. The underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans and 
leases. The Bank does not have the ability to direct the relevant activities of these structured entities and has no exposure to their variable returns, other than 
the right to receive interest income and dividend income from its investments. Consequently, the Bank does not control these structured entities and does not 
consolidate them.

(1)  The main underlying assets, located in Canada, are residential mortgages, automobile loans, automobile inventory financings, and other receivables. As at October 31, 2017, the notional 
committed amount of the global-style liquidity facilities totalled $2.7 billion ($2.9 billion as at October 31, 2016), representing the total amount of commercial paper outstanding. The Bank 
also provides series-wide credit enhancement facilities for a notional committed amount of $30 million ($30 million as at October 31, 2016). The maximum exposure to loss cannot exceed 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding. As at October 31, 2017, the Bank held $6 million in commercial paper ($4 million as at October 31, 2016) and, consequently, the maximum 
potential amount of future payments as at October 31, 2017 is limited to $2.7 billion ($2.9 billion as at October 31, 2016), which represents the undrawn liquidity and credit enhancement 
facilities. 
(2)  As at October 31, 2017, the carrying value of the restructured notes of the master asset vehicle (MAV) conduits and of the other restructured notes held by the Bank was nil ($619 million as 
at October 31, 2016). The change in the carrying value of the restructured notes of the MAV conduits during the year ended October 31, 2017 was mainly attributable to capital repayments. 
During fiscal 2017, given the repayment of the restructured notes, the Bank ceased its commitment to contribute to the margin funding facility of the MAV conduits. The undrawn margin 
funding facility stood at $800 million as at October 31, 2016. 
(3)  The underlying assets are various financial instruments and are presented on a net asset basis. Certain investment funds are in a trading portfolio. 
(4)  The underlying assets are private investments. The amount of total assets of the structured entities corresponds to the amount for the most recent available period. 
(5)  The underlying assets are residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans and leases. 
 
Consolidated Structured Entities 
Securitization Entity for the Bank’s Credit Card Receivables 
In April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its credit card securitization program on a revolving basis and to use the entity 
for capital management and funding purposes.  
 
The Bank provides first-loss protection against the losses since it retains the excess spread from the portfolio of sold receivables. The excess spread 
represents the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid. The Bank also provides second-loss protection as it 
holds subordinated notes issued by CCCT II. In addition, the Bank acts as an administrative agent and servicer and as such is responsible for the daily 
administration and management of CCCT II’s credit card receivables. The Bank therefore has the ability to direct the relevant activities of CCCT II and can 
exercise its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls CCCT II and consolidates it. 
 
Investment Funds  
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in 
certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. The Bank controls the relevant activities of these funds through its involvement as an investor and 
its significant exposure to their variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates these funds.

Covered Bonds 
NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership 
In December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond 
Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold 
uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. The Bank acts as manager of the partnership 
and has decision-making authority over its relevant activities in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program. In 
addition, the Bank is able, in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program, to affect the variable returns of the 
partnership, which are directly related to the return on the mortgage loan portfolio and the interest on the loans from the Bank. Consequently, the Bank 
controls the partnership and consolidates it. 
 
NBC Asset Trust 
The Bank created NBC Asset Trust for its funding and capital management needs. The securities issued by this trust constitute innovative capital instruments 
and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do not satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be 
phased out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022. For additional information, see Note 20. The issuance proceeds were used to acquire, from the 
Bank, residential mortgage loans. The Bank continues to administer these loans and is committed to repurchase from NBC Asset Trust the capital balance and 
unpaid accrued interest on any loan that is more than 90 days past due. The Bank also manages day-to-day operations and holds the special voting securities 
of the trust. After the distribution has been paid to the holders of the trust capital securities, the Bank, as the sole holder of the special trust securities, is 
entitled to receive the balance of net residual funds. Therefore, the Bank has the ability to direct the relevant activities of NBC Asset Trust and can use its power 
to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls this trust and consolidates it. 
 
Third-Party Structured Entities 
In 2015, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, acquired interests in portions of a third-party structured entity. Each portion of the structured entity is a 
deemed separate entity since all of the following criteria are met: 1) specified assets of the entity are the only source of payment for specified liabilities of (or 
specified other interests in) the entity; 2) parties other than those with the specified liabilities do not have rights or obligations related to the specified assets 
or to residual cash flows from those assets. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the deemed separate entities, as it has the ability to direct their 
relevant activities through its kick-out rights over the servicer of their assets and because it is also exposed to the variability of their returns. 
 
The following table presents the Bank’s investments and other assets in the consolidated structured entities as well as the total assets of these entities.

NOTE 30 – MANAGEMENT OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
The Bank is exposed to credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and financing risk. The Bank’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing risk and the risk 
measurement methods are presented in the Risk Management section of the MD&A for the year ended October 31, 2017. Text in grey shading and tables 
identified with an asterisk (*) in the Risk Management section of the MD&A are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 
 
Residual Contractual Maturities of Balance Sheet Items and Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments 
 
The following tables present balance sheet items and off-balance-sheet commitments by residual contractual maturity as at October 31, 2017 and 2016. The 
information gathered from this maturity analysis is a component of liquidity and funding management. However, this maturity profile does not represent how 
the Bank manages its interest rate risk nor its liquidity risk and funding needs. The Bank considers factors other than contractual maturity in the assessment of 
liquid assets or in determining expected future cash flows.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the funding needs of its 
clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn.  
 
The Bank also has future minimum commitments under leases for premises as well for other contracts, mainly contracts for outsourced information technology 
services. Most of the lease commitments are related to operating leases.

NOTE 31 – INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY 
 
The Bank offers a range of financial products whose cash flows are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk arises from on- and off-balance-
sheet cash flow mismatches. The degree of exposure is based on the magnitude and direction of interest rate movements and on the extent of the mismatch of 
the maturities. Analyzing interest rate sensitivity gaps is one of the techniques used by the Bank to manage interest rate risk. 
 
The following table presents the sensitivity of the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet items to interest rate fluctuations.

NOTE 32 – SEGMENT DISCLOSURES 
 
The Bank carries out its activities in four business segments, which are defined below. For presentation purposes, other activities are grouped in the Other 
heading. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele and marketing strategy. 
 
The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2016. This 
presentation reflects the fact that the activities of subsidiary Credigy Ltd., which had previously been presented in the Financial Markets segment, and that the 
activities of subsidiary Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank) and of other international investments, which had previously been presented in the Other 
heading, are now presented in the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its 
activities with its management structure. 
 
Personal and Commercial  
The Personal and Commercial segment encompasses the banking, financing, and investing services offered to individuals and businesses as well as insurance 
operations. 
 
Wealth Management 
The Wealth Management segment comprises investment solutions, trust services, banking services, lending services and other wealth management solutions 
offered through internal and third-party distribution networks. 
 
Financial Markets 
The Financial Markets segment encompasses banking services, investment banking services and financial solutions for large and mid-size corporations, public 
sector organizations, and institutional investors. The segment is also active in proprietary trading and investment activities for the Bank. 
 
U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I)  
The USSF&I segment encompasses the specialty finance expertise provided by subsidiary Credigy Ltd.; the activities of subsidiary ABA Bank, which offers 
financial products and services to individuals and businesses in Cambodia; and the activities of targeted investments in certain emerging markets. 
 
Other 
This heading encompasses Treasury activities, including the Bank’s asset and liability management, liquidity management and funding operations, certain 
non-recurring items and the unallocated portion of corporate services. 
 
The segment disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note 1, except for the net interest income, non-interest 
income and income taxes (recovery) of the operating segments, which are presented on a taxable equivalent basis. Taxable equivalent basis is a calculation 
method that consists in grossing up certain tax-exempt income by the amount of income tax that would have otherwise been payable. The effect of these 
adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. Head office expenses are allocated to each operating segment presented in the business segment results. 
The Bank assesses performance based on the net income attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. Intersegment revenues are recognized at the exchange 
amount. Segment assets correspond to average assets used in segment operations.

(2)  For the year ended October 31, 2017, Net interest income was grossed up by $209 million ($231 million in 2016), Non-interest income was grossed up by $35 million ($4 million in 2016), 
and an equivalent amount was recognized in Income taxes (recovery). The effect of these adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. 
(3)  During the year ended October 31, 2017, the Bank reversed, by $40 million, the sectoral provision on non-impaired loans recorded for the oil and gas producer and service company loan 
portfolio presented in the Personal and Commercial segment, and the $40 million in provisions for credit losses in the Other heading reflects an increase in the collective allowance for credit 
risk on non-impaired loans. For the year ended October 31, 2016, the Provisions for credit losses item had included a $250 million sectoral provision on non-impaired loans recorded for the 
oil and gas producer and service company loan portfolio, reported in the Personal and Commercial segment.

NOTE 33 – ACQUISITION 
  
Acquisition of Advanced Bank of Asia Limited 
On May 16, 2016, the Bank completed the acquisition of Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank), a major Cambodian financial institution that offers 
financial products and services to individuals and businesses. This acquisition is part of the Bank’s international growth strategy and, upon completion, 
brought the Bank’s common share equity interest in ABA Bank to 90%. The sum of the $119 million cash purchase price, of the fair value of the previously held 
interest, and of the estimated value of the non-controlling interest established at the acquisition date exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by 
$129 million. This excess amount was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill and mainly represents ABA Bank’s expected business growth 
in Cambodia. The goodwill from this acquisition was not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired receivables, consisting mainly of personal and commercial 
loans, had an estimated acquisition-date fair value of $754 million. This amount also represents the gross contractual amounts receivable that the Bank 
expects to fully recover. 
 
During the year ended October 31, 2016, the Bank also recognized a $41 million non-taxable gain on the revaluation of its previously held equity interest in 
ABA Bank in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. For business segment disclosure purposes, this gain and 
ABA Bank’s financial results have been included in the USSF&I segment. ABA Bank’s results have been consolidated in the Bank’s financial statements since 
May 17, 2016.  
  
 
NOTE 34 – EVENT AFTER THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DATE  
  
Redemption of Preferred Shares 
On November 15, 2017, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 28 First Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the 
share conditions, the redemption price was $25.00 per share plus the periodic dividend declared and unpaid. The Bank redeemed 8,000,000 Series 28 
preferred shares for a total amount of $200 million, which will reduce Preferred share capital.
