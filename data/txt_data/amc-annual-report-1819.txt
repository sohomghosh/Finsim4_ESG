5 
 
 
Controls. Our values of being open, connected and dependable are the foundations of our 
risk culture and help us make the right decisions and take the appropriate risks. 
 
The Company has adopted a risk management and internal control structure, referred to as 
the  Three  Lines  of  Defence,  to  ensure  it  achieves  its  commercial  aims  while  meeting 
regulatory and legal requirements and its responsibilities to shareholders, customers and 
staff. 
 
1st Line: Comprises predominantly management of Businesses who are accountable and 
responsible for their day to day activities and processes, their management of risks arising 
and the controls to mitigate those risks.  
 
2nd  Line:  Comprises  predominantly  the  Governance  Functions  (e.g.,  Risk  Teams, 
Regulatory  Compliance  and  Financial  Crime  Compliance  teams  etc.)  whose  role  is  to 
ensure that the Group meets its risk management and internal control responsibilities in 
relation to the risks they are responsible for overseeing 
  
3rd Line: is Global Internal Audit. Global Internal Audit provides independent assurance to 
the Group over the design and operation of HSBC's risk management, governance and 
internal control processes. 
 
Risk management is an integral part of the way we do business. We have detailed risk 
management  procedures  to  comply  with  local  regulatory  guidelines  and  internal  group 
policies. The group has issued internal guidelines named as “Functional Instruction Manual” 
which  are  required  to  be  complied  comprehensively.  These  are  global  best  practice 
guidelines for each functional/business area. These guidelines have been prepared based 
on  years  of  experience  and  are  in  a  number  of  cases  more  stringent  than  the  local 
regulatory requirements. 
 
An experienced Risk Management team monitors Investment, Liquidity and Counterparty 
Limits and any exceptions are deliberated in Risk Management Meeting (RMM) meetings 
that are held every Month. The scope and remit of the AMIN RMM extends to the entire 
business of AMIN and HSBC Mutual Fund including managed account portfolios and sub-
advised accounts.

regulations,  the  AMIN  risk  management  strategy  and  appetite,  policies  and  control 
standards for AMIN and to monitor their implementation. In this regard, the AMIN RMM will 
review the material risks affecting the AMIN business and is responsible for the oversight of 
the risk and internal control environment in AMIN.

HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019  
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
Background 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited ("the Company") was incorporated on December 12, 
2001. The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private 
Limited. Its principal activity is to act as an Investment Manager to HSBC Mutual Fund ("the Fund"). The 
Company manages the Mutual Fund schemes launched by HSBC Mutual Fund and provides various 
administrative services to the Fund as laid down in the Investment Management Agreement dated February 
7, 2002. The Company is also a SEBI registered Portfolio Manager. The Company has received a certificate 
from SEBI to act as Portfolio Manager. The said certificate is valid up to September 15, 2020 and to be 
renewed thereafter. It provides discretionary and advisory Portfolio Management Services (PMS) to its 
clients. The Company also provides sub-advisory non binding services to its group entities.   
 
Note 1 Summary of Significant accounting policies 
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these  financial 
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise 
stated.  
 
1.  Basis of preparation 
 
1.1 Compliance with Ind AS 
 
The financial statements comply in all material aspects with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015] and other relevant provisions of the Act. 
  
The financial statements up to the year ended March 31, 2018 were prepared in accordance with 
the accounting standards notified under Companies (Accounting Standard) Rules, 2006 (as 
amended) and other relevant provisions of the Act. Beginning  April 1, 2018, the Company has for 
the first time adopted Ind AS with a transition date of April 1, 2017. 
 
These financial statements are the first financial statements of the Company under Ind AS. Refer 
note 36 for an explanation of how the transition from previous GAAP to Ind AS has affected the 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
 
1.2 Historical cost convention 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except certain financial 
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value. 
 
 
1.3 Standards issued but not yet adopted: 
 
Ind AS 116 will affect primarily the accounting by lessees and will result in the recognition of almost 
all leases on balance sheet. The standard removes the current distinction between operating and 
finance leases and requires recognition of an asset (the right-of-use the leased item) and a financial 
liability to pay rentals for virtually all lease contracts. An optional exemption exists for short-term 
and low-value leases. Under Ind AS 116, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  
 
The statement of profit and loss will also be affected because the total expense is typically higher 
in the earlier years of a lease and lower in later years. Additionally, operating expense will be 
replaced with interest and depreciation. 
 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  The accounting by lessors will not significantly change. Some differences may arise as a result of 
the new guidance on the definition of a lease.  
 
The Company is in the process of assessing the detailed impact of Ind AS 116.  
There are no other standards, changes in standards and interpretations that are not in force up to 
reporting period that the Company expects to have a material impact arising from its application in 
its financial statements. 
 
2.  Segment reporting 
 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision maker.  
The power to assess the financial performance and position of the Company and make strategic 
decisions is vested in the Chief Executive Officer & Director who has been identified as the Chief 
Oerating Decisions Maker. The company presently has a single reportable segment. Necessary 
disclosure with respect to single reporting segment has been provided in note 35. 
 
3.  Foreign currency translation 
 
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The  financial statements are 
presented in Indian rupee (₹), which is Company’s functional and presentation currency. Except as 
otherwise indicated, financial statements presented in Indian rupee has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand. 
 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit or loss.  
All foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
 
4.  Revenue recognition 
 
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is 
recognised when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised 
good or service to a customer.  
 
When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, the Company recognizes as revenue the amount 
of the transaction price (excluding estimates of variable consideration) that is allocated to that 
performance obligation. 
 
 
The Company applies the five-step approach for recognition of revenue: 
 
•  Identification of contract(s) with customers; 
•  Identification of the separate performance obligations in the contract; 
•  Determination of transaction price; 
•  Allocation of transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and 
•  Recognition of revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.

Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  Management fees 
 
Management fees(net of GST) from mutual fund schemes are recognised on an accrual basis in 
accordance with the investment management agreement and provision of SEBI (Mutual Fund) 
Regulations, 1996. Revenue from management fees is recognised as and when services are 
performed over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided 
by the Company. 
 
Other Management fees  
 
Portfolio management fees (net of GST) are recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
respective terms of contract with counter parties. Revenue from portfolio management fees is 
recognised as and when services are performed over time as the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits provided by the Company. 
 
Advisory fees 
 
Advisory fees are recognised as and when services are performed over the time as the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the company. 
 
5.  Income tax 
Current taxes 
The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable 
income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.  
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in 
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. 
It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities.  
Deferred taxes 
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the  financial 
statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses 
only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary 
differences and losses.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. 
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to 
offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  Minimum Alternate Tax credit is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is 
convincing evidence that the company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. Such 
asset is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is 
written down to the extent there is no longer a convincing evidence to the effect that the Company 
will pay normal income tax during the specified period. 
6.  Leases 
 
As a lessee 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the 
lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to 
the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless the 
payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for 
lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases. 
Finance Leases 
The  Company  leases  certain  tangible  assets  and  such  leases  where  the  Company  has 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. The outstanding liability is included in borrowings. The finance charge is 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. 
 
7.  Impairment of assets 
 
All assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets 
(cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible 
reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
 
8.  Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purpose of presentation in the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash in hand, balances and short term deposits with other banks and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes 
in value.  
 
9.  Trade receivables 
 
Trade  receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

  10.  Investments and other financial assets 
 
i.  Classification 
 
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: 
 
  those  to  be  measured  subsequently  at  fair  value  (either  through  other 
comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and 
  those measured at amortised cost. 
 
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets 
and the contractual terms of the cash flows.  
 
For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss 
or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on 
the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments, 
this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of 
initial  recognition  to  account  for  the  equity  investment  at  fair  value  through  other 
comprehensive income.  
 
The Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for 
managing those assets changes. 
 
ii.  Recognition 
 
Regular way of purchase and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the 
date on which the Company commits purchase or sale of financial asset. 
 
iii.   Measurement 
 
At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the 
case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial 
assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit and loss. 
 
Debt instruments 
 
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model 
for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three 
measurement categories into which the Company classifies its debt instruments: 
 
  Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised 
cost. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. 
Impairement losses are presented as separate line item in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. 
 
  Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for 
collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ 
cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at 
FVOCI.  Movements  in  the  carrying  amount  are  taken  through  OCI,  except  for  the 
recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and 
losses which are recognised in profit and loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit 
and loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included  using the effective interest 
rate method. Foreign exchange gains(losses) are presented in net gain on fair value 
changes and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in Statement of 
Profit and Loss. 
 
  Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for 
amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss 
on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss and presented net within Net gain/loss on fair value changes in 
the period in which it arises.  
 
Equity instruments 
 
The Company measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss. Changes 
in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in Net 
gain/loss on fair value changes in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
iv.  Impairment of financial assets 
 
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated 
with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI debt instruments. The impairment 
methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit 
risk. Note  28(b) details how the Company determines whether there has been a significant 
increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach 
required by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires expected lifetime losses to 
be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. 
 
v.  Derecognition of financial assets 
 
A financial asset is derecognised only when 
 
  The Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset;or 
 
  Retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes 
a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. 
 
Where  the  entity  has  transferred  an  asset,  the  Company  evaluates  whether  it  has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such 
cases,  the  financial  asset  is  derecognised.  Where  the  entity  has  not  transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is 
not derecognised. 
 
Where the entity has neither transferred a financial asset nor retains substantially all risks 
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the 
Company has not retained control of the financial asset. Where the Company retains 
control of the financial asset, the asset is continued to be recognised to the extent of 
continuing involvement in the financial asset.

(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  vi.  Income recognition 
 
Interest income 
 
Interest income from debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest rate 
method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a 
financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the company estimates the 
expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for 
example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the 
expected credit losses. 
 
Dividends 
 
Dividends are recognised in profit or loss only when the right to receive payment is 
established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow 
to the company, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. 
 
11.  Offsetting financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is 
an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable 
in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the 
Company or the counterparty. 
 
12. Financial liabilities 
 
i.  Classification as debt or equity 
 
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities 
or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the 
definition of a financial liability and an equity instrument. 
 
ii.  Initial recognition and measurement:  
 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and 
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
 
iii.  Subsequent measurement: 
 
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss over the period of the liabilities using the effective interest rate method. 
 
iv.  Derecognition: 
 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms or the terms of the existing liability are substantially 
modified, such as exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts 
is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
13. Property, plant and equipment 
All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. 
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
items.  
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with 
the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The 
carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when 
replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit and loss during the reporting 
period in which they are incurred. 
 
Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value 
Further, as disclosed in table below, based on technical evaluation done by management’s 
expert, the estimated useful life of fixed assets of the Company is different from useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of fixed assets 
used by the Company and past experience of its usage, the Company considers that the useful 
life for respective assets to be appropriate. 
 
Nature  of  Property,  Plant  and  Management Estimate 
Equipment  of Useful 
Life in months  
Furniture and fixtures  60 Months 
Computers    36 Months 
Office Equipments  60 Months 
Vehicles  Depreciated over lease tenure 
 
 
Depreciation  is  provided  on  a  pro-rata  basis  on  the  straight-line  method  over  the  
estimated useful lives of the assets, in order to reflect the actual usage of the assets. The 
depreciation charge for each period is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss, unless 
it is included in the carrying amount of any other asset. The useful life, residual value and the 
depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expectations differ 
from  previous  estimates,  the  changes  are  accounted  for  prospectively  as  a  change  in 
accounting estimate. 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at 
each  financial  year  end.  Advances  paid  towards  the  acquisition  of  property,  plant  and 
equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is classified as capital advances under other 
non financial assets and the cost of assets not put to use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment 
is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will 
flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  Repairs and 
maintenance costs are recognized in net profit in the statement of profit and loss when incurred. 
The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  upon sale or retirement of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the 
statement of profit and loss. Assets to be disposed off are reported at the lower of the carrying 
value or the fair value less cost to sell. 
 
Transition to Ind AS 
On transition to Ind AS, the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of 
property, plant and equipments recognised as at 1 April 2017 measured as per the previous 
GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of property, plant and equipment. 
 
14. Intangible assets 
 
Computer software 
Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as 
incurred. 
  
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique 
software products controlled by the Company are recognised as intangible assets when the 
following criteria are met: 
 
  it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use. 
  management intends to complete the software and use or sell it. 
  there is an ability to use or sell the software. 
  it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits.  
  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use 
or sell the software are available, and 
  the  expenditure  attributable  to  the  software  during  its  development  can  be  reliably 
measured.  
 
Capitalised development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at 
which the asset is available for use. 
 
Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful lives. A rebuttable presumption that the useful life of an intangible asset will not 
exceed 36 months  from the date when the asset is available for use is considered by the 
management. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each 
financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous 
estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly. 
 
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of an intangible asset are determined as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
recognised as income or expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
Amortisation methods and periods 
The Company amortises intangible assets with a finite useful life using the straight-line method 
over the following periods: 
Computer software   36 months  
 
Transition to Ind AS 
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of 
intangible assets recognised as at 1 April 2017 measured as per the previous GAAP and use that 
carrying value as the deemed cost of intangible assets.

15. Trade and other payables 
 
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the company prior to the 
end of financial year which are unpaid. Trade and other payables are presented as financial 
liabilities. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. 
 
16. Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses. 
 
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in 
settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same 
class of obligations may be small. 
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used 
to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 
 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the 
existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. A present obligation that 
arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle or reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is termed and disclosed as contingent 
liability. 
 
A contingent asset is disclosed, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. 
 
17. Employee benefits 
 
Short-term obligations 
 
Liabilities for salaries, including non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 
12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are 
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are 
measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are 
presented as current employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet.   
 
Post employement obligations  
The Company operates the following post-employment schemes:  
  defined benefit plans such as gratuity and 
  defined contribution plans such as provident fund and superannuation fund. 
 
Defined benefit plans (Gratuity) 
The liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plans 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The 
defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation denominated in INR is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields at the end of the 
reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the terms of the related 
obligation. The estimated future payments which are denominated in a currency other than INR, 
are discounted using market yields determined by reference to high-quality corporate bonds that 
are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms 
approximating to the terms of the related obligation. 
 
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined 
benefit obligation. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. 
 
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other 
comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in 
equity and in the balance sheet. 
Changes in the present  value  of the defined  benefit obligation resulting from plan 
amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service 
cost. 
 
Defined contribution plans 
 
Provident fund 
The Company pays provident fund contributions to publicly administered provident funds as 
per local regulations. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are accounted for as defined contribution plans and the 
contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.  Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available. 
 
Other  Long  term  employee  benefit  obligations  (Restricted  Share  plan/Share  based 
payments) 
 
The Company’s certain eligible employees are entitled to Restricted Share Plan (in the form of 
deferred bonus) as per the Company’s policy. The provision is assessed on a yearly basis based 
on actuarial valuation. The period-end provision is measured at the present value of estimated 
future cash flows. At the end of the tenure, the liability is settled in shares based on the prevailing 
market value.  
 
Bonus 
The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses. The Company recognises a 
provision where contractually obliged or  where there is a past practice that has created a 
constructive obligation.

  18. Contributed equity: 
 
Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax from the proceeds. 
 
19. Earnings per share 
 
Basic earnings per equity share are computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity 
holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the 
equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for 
deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares 
that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.  
 
The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares 
been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). 
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless 
issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period 
presented. 
 
20. New Fund Offer (‘NFO’) expenses 
 
Expenses relating to NFO of MF scheme are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss of the 
Company in the year in which these expenses are incurred. 
 
21. Brokerage expenses  
 
Distribution cost in form of brokerage paid to distributors are are charged to Statement of Profit and 
Loss of the Company in the year in which these expenses are incurred. Clawback of such 
brokerages, if any, is netted off from such distribution costs. 
 
22. Fund expenses 
 
Expenses incurred (inclusive of advertisement and brokerage expenses) on behalf of schemes of 
the Fund are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss of the Company unless considered 
recoverable from the schemes of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of SEBI (Mutual 
Fund) Regulations, 1996. 
 
23. Rounding of amounts  
 
All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest 
thousand  as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated. 
 
Note 2 Use of judgments, estimates and assumptions 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires that management make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported 
amount of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial 
statements and the income and expense for the reporting period. The actual results could differ from these 
estimates. 
 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. 
 
HSBC Asset Management (India) Private Limited 
Notes to the  financial statements  
for the year ended 31 March 2019 (Continued) 
(All amounts in thousands of Indian Rupees unless otherwise stated) 
 
  
Certain of the Company’s accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and 
subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently 
uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period 
and may have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition or 
results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where management could 
have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The critical policies that involves 
critical accounting estimates includes fair valuation of financial instruments, impairment of non-financial 
assets and deferred tax. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial 
statements are prudent and reasonable.

The above sensitivity analysis are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity 
of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the samemethod (present value of the definedbenefit
obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when
calculating the defined benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.
(vii) Maturity 
The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year end as follows:

(viii) Risk Exposure
Salary Inflation risk : Higher than expected increases in salary will increase the defined benefit obligation
Demographic risk : This is the risk of variability of results due to unsystematic nature of decrements that include mortality,
withdrawal,disabilityandretirement.Theeffectofthesedecrementsonthedefinedbenefitobligationisnotstraightforward

b) Fair value hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that 
are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are 
disclosed in the financial statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair 
value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting 
standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.

i) There are no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year.
ii) TheCompany'spolicyistorecognisetransfersintoandtransfersoutoffairvaluehierarchylevelsasattheendofthe
reporting period.
The Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial assets by 
valuation technique:
The fair value of financial instruments  are classified into three categories i.e. Level 1, 2 or 3 depending on the inputs 
used in the valuation technique. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active market for identical 
assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). 
The hierarchies used are as follows: 
Level 1: Hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investment in mutual fund 
units. The investment in all the open ended mutual funds are valued at closing Net Asset Value (NAV)/ Market Price, 
which represents the repurchase price at which the issuer will redeem the units from investors.These instruments are 
included in Level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation 
techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If 
all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. All the close 
-ended  mutual funds which are thinly traded in the active market are included in the Level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in 
level 3. The instruments are valued based on quoted prices for the similar instruments but for which significant 
observable adjustments are required to reflect the difference between the instruments. There are lease borrowings which 
are fair valued items.
c) Valuation technique used to determine fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
The fair value of the closed ended mutual fund units is determined using obervable NAV at the reporting date as 
declared by the issuer. However, the company may perform an adjustment(e.g. liquidity valuation adjustment in case of 
thinly traded investment) to the NAV if they consider the same as significant in order to derive the fair value of the Level 
2 classified investments.
d) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying 
amounts are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such instruments include, cash and bank balances, trade 
and other receivables, trade and other payables, short term loans and bank deposits without a specific maturity. Such 
amounts have been classified as Level 3 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the 
balance sheet.
Further the Company considers the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
approximates their carrying value, where fair values are calculated by discounting the future cash flows using rate 
adjusted for the counterparties credit risk.

ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk where the company is exposed to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of its financial
instruments will fluctuate as a result of a changes in market interest rates.
The Company does not have any variable rate borrowings. There are some investments in fixed rate debt securities measured at 
fair value through profit or loss. 
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from investments held  in units of the funds it manages. These funds invests in equity 
and debt securities. In case of equity investments the units are fairly backed by equity price risk rather than credit risk. The 
exposure to interest rate risk in case of units backed by debt securities is measured using sensitivity analysis as follows:
Impact on profit after tax and 
equity
Particulars March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018
Interest rate – Increase 0.5% (2018 – 0.5%)                   (2,796)                   (2,741)

iii) Price Risk
Price risk is the risk that the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices. 
Sensitivity
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases of the index on the Company’s equity and profit for the period. The 
analysis is based on the assumption that the equity index had changed by 5% (2018 - 6%) with all other variables held constant, 
and that all the Company’s investments moved in line with the index.

b) Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from its investment transactions.
Credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Company in accordance with policies and procedures in place. The Company is 
exposed to credit risk from investments held  in units of the funds it manages.These investments  are measured at fair value through 
profit or loss. The company has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Company's financial assets subject to the expected credit loss model under Ind AS 109 are cash and cash equivalents, deposits 
with banks, trade receivables, staff loans etc.
Staff loans and receivables have been considered to enjoy the low credit risk as they meet the following criteria:
i) they have a low risk of default,
ii) the counterparty is considered, in the short term, to have a strong capacity to meet its obligations in the near term, and
iii) the company expects, in the longer term, that adverse changes in economic and business conditions might, but will not necessarily, 
reduce the ability of the counterparty to fulfil its obligations.
The Company has placed security deposit with lessors for premises leased by the Company as at March 31, 2019 of Rs. 7,446 and 
March 31, 2018 of Rs. 6,666. The Company does not perceive any significant decline in credit risk of the lessors where the amount of 
security deposit is material and hence expected probability of default is considered as zero.  
Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits are held with only high rated banks/financial institutions, credit risk on them is therefore 
insignificant.
The Company's exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the reporting date, as 
summarised below:

36 First-time adoption of IND AS
Introduction
The transition as at April 1, 2017 to Ind AS was carried out from Previous GAAP. The exemptions and exceptions applied by the Company 
in accordance with Ind AS 101 First–time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, the reconciliations of equity and total comprehensive 
income in accordance with Previous GAAP to Ind AS are explained below.
Set out below are the applicable Ind AS 101 optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions applied in the transition from previous GAAP to 
Ind AS.
(a) Optional exemptions availed
(i)  Deemed cost
Ind AS 101 permits a first-time adopter to elect to continue with the carrying value for all of its property, plant and equipment (including 
capital work-in-progress) as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous 
GAAP and use that as its deemed cost as at the date of transition after making necessary adjustments. This exemption can also be used for 
intangible assets covered by Ind AS 38 Intangible Assets.
Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure all of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at their previous GAAP 
carrying value.
(b) Ind AS mandatory exceptions
The Company has applied the following exceptions from full retrospective application of Ind AS as mandatorily required under Ind AS 101:
(i) Estimates
An entity’s estimates in accordance with Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date 
in accordance with previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that 
those estimates were in error. Ind AS estimates as at April 1, 2017 are consistent with the estimates as at the same date made in conformity 
with previous GAAP. 
(ii) De-recognition of financial assets and liabilities
Ind AS 101 requires a first-time adopter to apply the de-recognition provisions of Ind AS 109 prospectively for transactions occurring on or 
after the date of transition to Ind AS. However, Ind AS 101 allows a first-time adopter to apply the de-recognition requirements in Ind AS 109 
retrospectively from a date of the entity’s choosing, provided that the information needed to apply Ind AS 109 to financial assets and 
financial liabilities derecognised as a result of past transactions was obtained at the time of initially accounting for those transactions. The 
company has elected to apply the de-recognition provisions of Ind AS 109 prospectively from the date of transition to Ind AS.
(iii) Classification and measurement of financial assets
Ind AS 101 requires an entity to assess classification and measurement of financial assets (investment in mutual fund units) on the basis of 
the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Reconciliations between previous GAAP and Ind AS
Ind AS 101 requires  a first time adopter to reconcile equity, total comprehensive income and cash flows for prior periods. The following 
tables represent the reconciliations from previous GAAP to Ind AS.
1. Reconciliation of total equity as at March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017

3. Notes to first-time adoption:
(i) Change in fair valuation of investments
Under previous GAAP, current investments were measured at lower of cost or fair value and long term investments were measured at cost 
less diminution in value which is other than temporary. Under Ind AS Financial assets other than amortized cost are subsequently measured 
at fair value.
Investments have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and changes in fair value are recognised in Statement of Profit and

Tax adjustments include deferred tax impact on account of differences between Previous GAAP and Ind AS. Under earlier GAAP, deferred 
tax was not recognised due to lack of virtual certainty. However, as per Ind AS-12, due to reasonable certainty, deferred tax on variety of 
items have been created.
(iii) Employee benefits
Under previous GAAP, actuarial gains and losses were recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Under Ind AS, the actuarial gains 
and losses form part of re-measurement of net defined benefit liability / asset which is recognised in other comprehensive income in the 
respective periods. 
Retained earnings
Retained earnings as at 1 April 2017 has been adjusted consequent to the above Ind AS transition adjustments.
Other comprehensive income
Under Ind AS, all items of income and expense recognised in a period should be included in profit or loss for the period, unless a standard 
requires or permits otherwise. Items of income and expense that are not recognised in profit or loss but are shown in the statement of profit 
and loss as ‘other comprehensive income’ includes remeasurements of defined benefit plans. The concept of other comprehensive income 
did not exist under previous GAAP.
