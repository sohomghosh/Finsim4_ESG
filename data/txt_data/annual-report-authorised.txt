MarketReview
Optimism over the US growth and inflation outlook rose in March as the vaccine rollout continued to gain pace and
President Biden’s US$1.9 trillion emergency fiscal package was approved by the House. Yields on US Treasuries
(USTs) rose, underperforming other developed market government bonds, as market participants anticipated
additional supply, higher near-term growth and inflationary pressures that some felt could result in the Federal
Reserve (Fed) bringing forward monetary policy normalization. At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting, the Fed raised this year’s growth and inflation forecasts but left itsmedian dot forecast forinterest rates in
2023 unchanged. In doing so, it emphasized its dovish framework that will only respond to realized changes in
inflation,ratherthanexpectations,andrequiringarecoveryinthejobsmarket.Inabidtocontainrisingyieldsacross

OutlookandStrategy
Western Asset expects that the second half of the year should see very strong growth in global gross domestic

of Western societies’ middle-class wages, aging demographics and rising global debt burdens. Moreover, the small

MarketReview
With significant headwinds as a result of the rates selloff during the month of March (for example, the 10-year US
Treasury ( UST) ended March at 1.74% after having begun the month at 1.42%),it wasnot surprising that the return
profile was challenged. This is the first time since the September-October 2018 period that we’ve seen two
consecutivemonthsofnegativereturnsfromtheJACIFINSCORPIndex,whichreturned-0.2%inMarch(bringingthe
first quarter tally to -0.1%). On a sector basis and beginning with Asian financials, we note that bank senior spreads

on the premise that the output gap remains and there is excess supply. Only 52% or about US$1 trillion of the

results in saving behaviour rather than spending. The first US$3 trillion package, passed in March 2020, produced a

It would require a significant narrowing of the output gap, a tightening of labour markets and an increase in firms’
pricing power, for central banks to be concerned that commodity price inflation could spill over into core inflation.

shifts in global supply chains post COVID-19, will add to growth downside risks. A slower vaccination pace risks
COVID-19 resurgence and a longer path to the reopening of borders for tourism and trade; this continues to mean
downside risks persist in Asia. North Asian economies, those with higher beta to US growth demand, will benefit
fromagrowthrecoveryintheUS.

was base-effect driven and not use-ful in guiding policy objectives. A larger than expected annual quota for special
local government bonds (SLGB) at RMB3.65 trillion (versus RMB3.0 trillion expected) and an official fiscal deficit of
3.2%of GDP (versus3.0%expected) meansthe broad-based fiscaldeficit isexpected to reach 6.5%of GDP this year
(versus 8.4% last year and 5.0% in 2019). There is no change to our view for lower bond yields in China given we
expect slower credit growth, slower sequential economic growth momentum and no sharp U-turn in the monetary
policy stance. China’s official manufacturing PMI dropped further to a weaker-than-expected 50.6 in February from
51.3inJanuary,whilethenon-manufacturingPMIdroppedto51.4inFebruaryfrom52.4inJanuary,whichwasalso
weaker than market consensus. The February fall in the manufacturing PMI was broadly based but led mainly by
production and new orders sub-indices, which dipped to 51.9 and 51.5, respectively, in February from 53.5 and 52.3,
respectively, in January. The decline of the non-manufacturing PMI was mainly dragged down by the sub-index of
the construction sector (which fell to 54.7 in February from 60.0 in January). The Chinese government’s restrictive

With a sharp selloff in global rates alongside USTs, Asia bond markets demonstrated diversity. While higher-beta
markets such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia saw moves of the same order of magnitude as USTs, Korea and
China stood out in their small correction. These markets continue to be underpinned by domestic monetary
conditions and deep local markets. The fear of reflation was the main driver in global rates on the back of a strong
global recovery and rising commodity prices. Even countries deemed more vulnerable to taper tantrum episodes,

kept rates unchanged, Asian central banks are in a different situation versus other emerging economies. Unlike in
other emerging economies, the emerging Asia inflation outlook is relatively benign and continues to be headline-
driven on base effects. Meanwhile external conditions have turned more challenging, and in Asia’s case the most
vulnerable is Indonesia. Policymakers have a strong track record in making the necessary fiscal and monetary
adjustments before such conditions materialize into financial stability risks. More importantly, there is still policy
credibilityandmarketconfidence.

The near-term recovery from COVID-19 will create opportunities, as firms see Singapore as a relatively solid base of
political and social stability as a regional outpost. For as long as policymakers are able to manage domestic
sociopolitical challenges arising from the economy’s openness and continue to be an ideal regional hub in various
sectors, structural growth opportunity will persist. A strong reserves position, political stability and fiscal space will
allow for policy response should headwinds arise from ei-ther growing geopolitical tensions or a resurgence of

(along with Australia) among AAA rated countries, the 10-year SGS compares favourably in terms of real-yield
expectations among higher-rated Asian local currency bonds. Singapore’s insurance industry assets have been
growing at approximately 10% annually, with more than 50% held in debt securities (versus approximately 35% in
equi-ties). This is likely to support SGS duration demand in an environment of external growth headwinds. In terms

OutlookandStrategy
We continue to believe that most of the longer-term structural drivers of economic growth in ASEAN are unlikely to
change materially. The region is also well placed to take advantage of emerging themes such as supply chain
diversification.
Indonesia: The Ministry of Health has targeted 181 million vaccinations by the first quarter of 2022 (which would
represent 100% coverage for the over 30s) and the government has made vaccination mandatory. This may reflect
theseverityoftheeconomicimpactofCOVID,with2020grossdomesticproduct(GDP)finishingdown-2.1%,thefirst
negative print since the Asian financial crisis. Bank Indonesia lowered its 2021 forecast to between +4.3–5.3%,
reflecting the continued restrictions, and lowered rates again in February,bringing the policy rate to 3.5%.In March,
higher yields in the US resulted in investment outflows and some weakness in the rupiah (-4% year to date against
the US dollar), although Bank Indonesia is likely to use bond purchases for support, at least in the short term.
Corporate earnings forecasts for FY21 remain low on a relative basis at +29%, reflecting the weak consumer
environmentandbroadermacrouncertaintyfeedingintoaslowerrecoverycomparedwiththewiderASEANregion.
Malaysia: Malaysia had done a good job in controlling COVID, although some movement control restrictions have
remained in place throughout March.Although the vaccinationprogrammewillcoveratleasthalfofthepopulation,
rollout has so far remained slow. Fourth-quarter GDP was -3.4%, so FY20 came in at -5.6%. Many industries say
labour shortages are causing issues, which are hard to resolve without immigration. Continued strength in exports
(+21% year on year in February) helped widen the trade surplus, while inflation remains negligible—meaning the

+57% in 2021, then -2% in 2022 as the super cycle in glove profitability wanes on a new supply glut. In that context,
estimates look very different from other markets, where 2022 is expected to deliver a continuation of earnings

Auditor’sResponsibilitiesfortheAuditoftheFinancialStatements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonableassuranceisahighlevelofassurance,butisnotaguaranteethatanauditconductedinaccordancewith
SSAswillalwaysdetectamaterialmisstatementwhenitexists.Misstatementscanarisefromfraudorerrorandare
consideredmaterialif,individuallyorintheaggregate,theycouldreasonablybeexpectedtoinfluencetheeconomic
decisionsofuserstakenonthebasisofthesefinancialstatements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticismthroughouttheaudit.Wealso:
Š Identify and assesstherisksofmaterialmisstatementofthefinancialstatements,whetherduetofraudorerror,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations,ortheoverrideofinternalcontrol.
Š Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund’sinternalcontrol.
Š Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
relateddisclosuresmadebytheManager.
Š Conclude on the appropriateness of the Manager’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast

“dilution”.Inordertocounterthisandtoprotectunitholders’interests,witheffectfrom1September2020,the
Manager applied “dilution adjustment” as part of its daily valuation policy. In certain circumstances, the
Manager (if in its opinion in good faith it is in the interest of unitholders to do so) makes adjustments in the

(v) discount, prepayment fee, redemption premium and break cost from qualifying debt securities
issuedduringtheprescribedperiod;and
(vi) distributionsfromforeignunittrustsderivedfromoutsideSingaporeandreceivedinSingapore.
(b) The Singapore income tax represents tax deducted at source for Singapore sourced dividends. The
overseas income tax represents tax deducted at source on dividends derived from outside Singapore
andreceivedinSingapore.
The Fund invests in securities issued by entities which are domiciled in foreign countries. Many of these
foreign countries have tax laws which indicate that taxes on gains on disposal of investments may be
applicable to non-residents, such as the Fund. Typically, these capital gains taxes are required to be
determined on a self assessment basis and, therefore, such taxes may not be deducted by the Fund’s brokers
ona“withholding”basis.
The Fund is required to recognise a tax liability when it is probable that the tax laws of foreign countries
require a tax liability to be assessed on the Fund’s gains oninvestmentssourcedfromsuchforeigncountries,
assuming the relevant taxing authorities have full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances. The tax
liability is then measured at the amount expected to be paid to the relevant taxation authorities using the tax
laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. There is
sometimes uncertainty about the way enacted tax law is applied to offshore investment funds. This creates
uncertaintyaboutwhetherornotataxliabilitywillultimatelybepaidbytheFund.Thereforewhenmeasuring
any uncertain tax liabilities management considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at the
timewhichcouldinfluencethelikelihoodofpayment,includinganyformalorinformalpracticesoftherelevant
taxauthorities.
As at 31 March 2021 and 2020, the Fund has uncertain tax exposure with respect to gains on investments of
which the tax liability is estimated to be nil. While this represents the Manager’s best estimate, the estimated
valuecoulddiffersignificantlyfromtheamountultimatelypayable.

10. Financialriskmanagement
The Fund’s activities expose it to a variety of market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Fund’s overall risk management policy seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects of such risks on the Fund’s financial performance. The Fund may use futures, options and/or
currency forward contractssubject to the terms of theTrustDeedtomoderatecertainriskexposures.Specific
guidelines on exposures to individual securities and certain industries and/or countries are in place for the
FundatanytimeaspartoftheoverallfinancialriskmanagementtoreducetheFund’sriskexposures.
The Fund’s assets principally consist of financial instruments such as equity investments and cash. They are
held in accordance with the published investment policies of the Fund. The allocation of assets between the
varioustypesofinvestmentsisdeterminedbytheManagertoachievetheirinvestmentobjectives.

maybeonlyindirectlyobservablesuchasvolatilitiesandcorrelations.Marketriskincludessuchfactors
as changes in economic environment, consumption pattern and investor’s expectation etc. which may
have significant impact on the value of the investments. The Fund’s investments are substantially
dependent on changes in market prices. The Fund’s investments are monitored by the Manager on a
regular basis so as to assess changes in fundamentals and valuation. Although the Manager makes

Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and develop. The situation is dynamic with various cities and
countries around the world responding in different ways to address the pandemic. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Given the extent of
the crisis, it is difficult to estimate the impact or duration of the volatility on the portfolio of the Fund.
TheManageriscloselymonitoringthedevelopmentoftheCovid-19pandemicanditsrelatedimpact.
The Fund’s market risk is affected primarily by changes in three components; changes in actual market
prices,interestratevolatilityandforeignexchangemovements.
(i) Pricerisk
Priceriskprimarilyresultsfromexposuretovolatilityofequityprices.TheFundachievesmedium
to long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 70% of the Fund in securities issued by
companies that are incorporated, domiciled or listed, or have a significant economic interest, in
South and South-East Asia countries. The Manager is of the view that the price risk the Fund is
subjecttoisbestreflectedbymovementsinitsbenchmarkofMSCIACASEANIndex.
The table below summarises the impact of increases/decreases from the Fund’s underlying
investmentsin equities on the Fund’snet assetsattributable to unitholdersat31March2021and
2020. The analysis is based on the assumption that the index components within the benchmark
increased/decreasedbyareasonablepossibleshift,withallothervariablesheldconstantandthat
the fair value of Fund’s investments moved according to the historicalcorrelation with the index.
The Manager has used theirview of what would be a “reasonable possible shift” to estimate the
change in market sensitivity analysis below. However, this does not represent a prediction of the
futuremovementinthecorrespondingkeymarkets.

As of 31 March 2021 and 2020, the Fund does not hold substantial monetary assets/liabilities.

countries around the world responding in different ways to address the pandemic. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Given the extent of
the crisis, it is difficult to estimate the impact or duration of the volatility on the portfolio of the
Sub-Fund.TheManageriscloselymonitoringthedevelopmentoftheCovid-19pandemicanditsrelated
impact.
The Sub-Fund’s market risk is affected primarily by changes in three components: changes in actual
marketprices,interestratevolatilityandforeignexchangemovements.
(i) Pricerisk
Price risk primarily results from exposure to volatility of equity prices. The Sub-Fund does not
hold equity securities as of 31 March 2021 and 2020, and therefore is not exposed to significant
amountofriskarisingfromchangesinequityprices.
(ii) Interestraterisk

(ii) Interestraterisk(continued)
It affects the value of fixed income securities more than equities. As interest rate rise, prices of
fixedincomesecuritiesmayfallandviceversa.Therationaleisthatasinterestrateincreases,the
opportunity cost of holding a bond increases since investors are able to realise greater yields by
switching to other investments that reflect the higher interest rate. The Manager regularly
assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates outlook and take appropriate
measuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.
As the Sub-Fund invests in primarily fixed income securities, the values of which are driven by
changes in interest rates, the Sub-Fund is mainly subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates
rise,thevalueofpreviouslyacquiredfixedincomesecuritieswillnormallyfallbecausenewfixed
income securities acquired will pay a higher rate of interest. In contrast, if interest rates fall, then
the value of the previously acquired fixed income securities will normally rise. The Manager
regularly assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates outlook and take
appropriate measures accordingly to control the impact of interest rate risk. In a rising interest
rateenvironment,theSub-Fundwillacquiredebtswithashortermaturityprofiletominimisethe
negative impact to the portfolio. The Sub-Fund’s policy requires the Manager to manage the risk
by measuring the mismatch of the interest rate sensitivity gap of financial assets and liabilities
and calculating the average duration of the portfolio of fixed interest securities. The average
effectivedurationoftheSub-Fund’sportfolioisameasureofthesensitivityofthefairvalueofthe

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Sub-Fund will encounter difficulty in settling a liability, including
redemptionrequests.
The Sub-Fund is exposed to daily cash redemption of units in the Sub-Fund. The Sub-Fund invest the
majority of its assets in investments that are traded in active markets and can be readily disposed of.
Investments which are neither listed nor quoted are restricted to a maximum of 10% of the net asset
value (depends on actual circumstances). As at 31 March 2021, there are no investments in unlisted or
unquotedsecurities(2020:$Nil).

Manager’sResponsibilitiesfortheAuditoftheFinancialStatements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonableassuranceisahighlevelofassurance,butisnotaguaranteethatanauditconductedinaccordancewith
SSAswillalwaysdetectamaterialmisstatementwhenitexists.Misstatementscanarisefromfraudorerrorandare
consideredmaterialif,individuallyorintheaggregate,theycouldreasonablybeexpectedtoinfluencetheeconomic
decisionsofuserstakenonthebasisofthesefinancialstatements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticismthroughouttheaudit.Wealso:
Š Identify and assesstherisksofmaterialmisstatementofthefinancialstatements,whetherduetofraudorerror,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations,ortheoverrideofinternalcontrol.
Š Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund’sinternalcontrol.
Š Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
relateddisclosuresmadebytheManager.
Š Conclude on the appropriateness of the Manager’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast

(b) The overseas income tax represents tax deducted at source on income derived from outside Singapore
andreceivedinSingapore.
The Fund invests in securities issued by entities which are domiciled in foreign countries. Many of these
foreign countries have tax laws which indicate that taxes on gains on disposal of investments may be
applicable to non-residents, such as the Fund. Typically, these capital gains taxes are required to be
determined on a self assessment basis and, therefore, such taxes may not be deducted by the Fund’s brokers
ona“withholding”basis.
TheFundisrequiredtorecogniseataxliabilitywhenitisprobablethatthetaxlawsofforeigncountriesrequirea
tax liability to be assessed on the Fund’s gains on investments sourced from such foreign countries, assuming
the relevant taxing authorities have full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances. The tax liability is then

As at 31 March 2021 and 2020, the Fund has uncertain tax exposure with respect to gains on investments of
which the tax liability is estimated to be nil. While this represents the Managers’ best estimate, the estimated

as changes in economic environment, consumption pattern and investor’s expectation etc. which may
have significant impact on the value of the investments. The Fund’s investments are substantially
dependent on changes in market prices. The Fund’s investments are monitored by the Manager on a
regular basis so as to assess changes in fundamentals and valuation. Although the Manager makes

Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and develop. The situation is dynamic with various cities and
countries around the world responding in different ways to address the pandemic. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Given the extent of
the crisis, it is difficult to estimate the impact or duration of the volatility on the portfolio of the Fund.
TheManageriscloselymonitoringthedevelopmentoftheCovid-19pandemicanditsrelatedimpact.
The Fund’s market risk is affected primarily by changes in three components: changes in actual market
prices,interestratevolatilityandforeignexchangemovements.

(ii) Interestraterisk
Interestrateriskistheriskthatthevalueofafinancialinstrumentwillfluctuateduetochangesin

It affects the value of fixed income securities more than equities. As interest rates rise, prices of
fixedincomesecuritiesmayfallandviceversa.Therationaleisthatasinterestrateincreases,the
opportunity cost of holding a bond increases since investors are able to realise greater yields by
switching to other investments that reflect the higher interest rate. The Manager regularly
assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates outlook and take appropriate
measuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.
As the Fund invests primarily in fixed income securities, the values of which are driven
significantly by changes in interest rates, the Fund is mainly subject to interest rate risk. When
interest rates rise, the value of previously acquired fixed income securities will normally fall
because new fixed income securities acquired will pay a higher rate of interest. In contrast, if
interest rates fall, then the value of the previously acquired fixed income securities will normally
rise. The Manager regularly assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates
outlookandtakeappropriatemeasuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.Ina
rising interest rate environment, the Fund will acquire debts with a shorter maturity profile to
minimisethenegativeimpacttotheportfolio.TheFund’spolicyrequirestheManagertomanage
the risk by measuring the mismatch of the interest rate sensitivity gap of financial assets and

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Unitholders of
Legg Mason Western Asset Asian Bond Trust
(ConstitutedunderaTrustDeedintheRepublicofSingapore)
ResponsibilitiesoftheManagerfortheFinancialStatements
In preparing the financial statements, the Manager is responsible for assessing the Fund’s ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the Manager either intends to terminate the Fund or to cease the Fund’s operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so. Note 1 to the financial statements states that the Fund will terminate on
15September2021.
TheManager’sresponsibilitiesincludeoverseeingtheFund’sfinancialreportingprocess.
Auditor’sResponsibilitiesfortheAuditoftheFinancialStatements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonableassuranceisahighlevelofassurance,butisnotaguaranteethatanauditconductedinaccordancewith
SSAswillalwaysdetectamaterialmisstatementwhenitexists.Misstatementscanarisefromfraudorerrorandare
consideredmaterialif,individuallyorintheaggregate,theycouldreasonablybeexpectedtoinfluencetheeconomic
decisionsofuserstakenonthebasisofthesefinancialstatements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticismthroughouttheaudit.Wealso:
Š Identify and assesstherisksofmaterialmisstatementofthefinancialstatements,whetherduetofraudorerror,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations,ortheoverrideofinternalcontrol.
Š Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund’sinternalcontrol.
Š Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
relateddisclosuresmadebytheManager.
Š ConcludeontheappropriatenessoftheManager’suseofthegoingconcernbasisofaccounting.Whensuchuse
is inappropriate and management uses an alternative basis of accounting, we conclude whether the alternative
basisused by management isacceptable in the circumstances.We also evaluate the adequacy of thedisclosure
describing the alternative basis of accounting and reason for its use. Our conclusions are based on audit
evidenceobtaineduptothedateofourauditor’sreport.
Š Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
andwhetherthefinancialstatementsrepresenttheunderlyingtransactionsandeventsinamannerthatachieves

UndertheDUTScheme,certainincomeoftheDUTFundisnottaxableinaccordancewithSections35(12)
and35(12A)oftheIncomeTaxAct.Suchincomeincludes:
(i) gainsorprofitsderivedfromSingaporeorelsewherefromthedisposalofsecurities;
(ii) interest (otherthan interest forwhich tax hasbeen deducted underSection 45oftheIncomeTax
Act);
(iii) dividendsderivedfromoutsideSingaporeandreceivedinSingapore.
(iv) gains or profits derived from foreign exchange transactions, transactions in future contracts,
transactions in interest rate or currency forwards, swaps or option contracts and transactions in
forwards,swapsoroptioncontractsrelatingtoanysecuritiesoffinancialindex;
(v) discount, prepayment fee, redemption premium and break cost from qualifying debt securities
issuedduringtheprescribedperiod;and
(vi) distributionsfromforeignunittrustsderivedfromoutsideSingaporeandreceivedinSingapore.
(b) The Singapore income tax represents tax deducted at source for Singapore sourced income. The
overseas income tax represents tax deducted at source on income derived from outside Singapore and
receivedinSingapore.
The Fund invests in securities issued by entities which are domiciled in foreign countries. Many of these
foreign countries have tax laws which indicate that taxes on gains on disposal of investments may be
applicable to non-residents, such as the Fund. Typically, these capital gains taxes are required to be
determined on a self assessment basis and, therefore, such taxes may not be deducted by the Fund’s brokers
ona“withholding”basis.
The Fund is required to recognise a tax liability when it is probable that the tax laws of foreign countries
require a tax liability to be assessed on the Fund’s gains oninvestmentssourcedfromsuchforeigncountries,
assuming the relevant taxing authorities have full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances. The tax
liability is then measured at the amount expected to be paid to the relevant taxation authorities using the tax
laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. There is
sometimes uncertainty about the way enacted tax law is applied to offshore investment funds. This creates
uncertaintyaboutwhetherornotataxliabilitywillultimatelybepaidbytheFund.Thereforewhenmeasuring
any uncertain tax liabilities management considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at the
timewhichcouldinfluencethelikelihoodofpayment,includinganyformalorinformalpracticesoftherelevant
taxauthorities.
As at 31 March 2021 and 2020, the Fund has uncertain tax exposure with respect to gains on investments of
which the tax liability is estimated to be nil. While this represents the Manager’s best estimate, the estimated
valuecoulddiffersignificantlyfromtheamountultimatelypayable.

12. Financialriskmanagement
The Fund’s activities expose it to a variety of market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Fund’s overall risk management policy seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects of such risks on the Fund’s financial performance. The Fund may use futures, options and/or
currency forward contractssubject to the terms of theTrustDeedtomoderatecertainriskexposures.Specific
guidelines on exposures to individual security and certain industries are in place for the Fund at any time as

Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and develop. The situation is dynamic with various cities and
countries around the world responding in different ways to address the pandemic. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Given the extent of
the crisis, it is difficult to estimate the impact or duration of the volatility on the portfolio of the Fund.
TheManageriscloselymonitoringthedevelopmentoftheCovid-19pandemicanditsrelatedimpact.
The Fund’s market risk is affected primarily by changes in three components: changes in actual market
prices,interestratevolatilityandforeignexchangemovements.
(i) Pricerisk
Price risk primarily results from exposure to volatility of equity prices. The Fund does not hold
equitysecuritiesasof31March2021and2020,andthereforeisnotexposedtosignificantamount
ofriskarisingfromchangesinequityprices.
(ii) Interestraterisk
Interestrateriskistheriskthatthevalueofafinancialinstrumentwillfluctuateduetochangesin
marketinterestrates.
It affects the value of fixed income securities more than equities. As interest rates rise, prices of
fixedincomesecuritiesmayfallandviceversa.Therationaleisthatasinterestrateincreases,the
opportunity cost of holding a bond increases since investors are able to realise greater yields by
switching to other investments that reflect the higher interest rate. The Manager regularly
assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates outlook and take appropriate
measuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.
As the Fund primarily invests in fixed income securities, the values of which are driven
significantly by changes in interest rates, the Fund is mainly subject to interest rate risk. When
interest rates rise, the value of previously acquired fixed income securities will normally fall
because new fixed income securities acquired will pay a higher rate of interest. In contrast, if
interest rates fall, then the value of the previously acquired fixed income securities will normally
rise. The Manager regularly assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates
outlookandtakeappropriatemeasuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.Ina
rising interest rate environment, the Fund will acquire debts with a shorter maturity profile to
minimisethenegativeimpacttotheportfolio.TheFund’spolicyrequirestheManagertomanage
the risk by measuring the mismatch of the interest rate sensitivity gap of financial assets and
liabilities and calculating the average duration of the portfolio of fixed interest securities. The

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional

Š Identify and assesstherisksofmaterialmisstatementofthefinancialstatements,whetherduetofraudorerror,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations,ortheoverrideofinternalcontrol.
Š Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the

Š Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and

as changes in economic environment, consumption pattern and investor’s expectation etc. which may
have significant impact on the value of the investments. The Fund’s investments are substantially
dependent on changes in market prices. The Fund’s investments are monitored by the Manager on a
regular basis so as to assess changes in fundamentals and valuation. Although the Manager makes

Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and develop. The situation is dynamic with various cities and
countries around the world responding in different ways to address the pandemic. As a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic, global financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Given the extent of
the crisis, it is difficult to estimate the impact or duration of the volatility on the portfolio of the Fund.
TheManageriscloselymonitoringthedevelopmentoftheCovid-19pandemicanditsrelatedimpact.
The Fund’s market risk is affected primary by changes in three components: changes in actual market
prices,interestratevolatilityandforeignexchangemovements.
(i) Pricerisk
Priceriskprimarilyresultsfromexposuretovolatilityofequityprices.TheFunddoesnotholdany
equity as of 31 March 2021 and 2020, and therefore is not exposed to significant amount of risk
arisingfromchangesinequityprices.
(ii) Interestraterisk
Interestrateriskistheriskthatthevalueofafinancialinstrumentwillfluctuateduetochangesin
marketinterestrates.
It affects the value of fixed income securities more directly than equities. As interest rates rise,
prices of fixed income securities may fall and vice versa. The rationale is that as interest rates
increase, the opportunity cost of holding a bond increases since investors are able to realise
greateryieldsbyswitchingtootherinvestmentsthatreflectthehigherinterestrate.TheManager
regularly assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates outlook and take
appropriatemeasuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.
As the Fund invests primarily in fixed income securities, the values of which are driven
significantly by changes in interest rates, the Fund is mainly subject to interest rate risk. When
interest rates rise, the value of previously acquired fixed income securities will normally fall
because new fixed income securities acquired will pay a higher rate of interest. In contrast, if
interest rates fall, then the value of the previously acquired fixed income securities will normally
rise. The Manager regularly assesses the economic condition, monitor changes in interest rates
outlookandtakeappropriatemeasuresaccordinglytocontroltheimpactofinterestraterisk.Ina
rising interest rate environment, the Fund will acquire debts with a shorter maturity profile to
minimisethenegativeimpacttotheportfolio.TheFund’spolicyrequirestheManagertomanage
