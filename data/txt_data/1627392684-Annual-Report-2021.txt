INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
 
To the Members of LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited  
 
Report on the Audit of the Ind AS Financial Statements  
 
   Opinion 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  Ind  AS  financial  statements  of  LIC  Mutual  Fund  Asset 
Management Limited. (“the Company”), which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31, 2021, 
the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash 
Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the 
aforesaid Ind AS financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as 
amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 
31, 2021, its profit including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity 
for the year ended on that date. 
 
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit of the Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those 
Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Ind AS Financial 
Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code 
of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the 
Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Ind AS financial 
statements. 
 
 
 
 
 
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Board Report, but does not include the Ind AS financial 
statements and our auditor's report thereon. 
 
Our opinion on the Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
 
In connection with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained 
prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact.  
 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements 
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of 
the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and 
changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted 
in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act 
read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other 
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Ind AS 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's    
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
 
 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.  
 
   Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Ind AS Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Ind AS financial     statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Ind AS financial statements. 
 
As  part  of  an  audit in accordance  with  SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain   
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also 
 
•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Ind AS financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
 
•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we 
are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate 
internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. 
 
•  Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
 
 
•  Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
 
 
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern 
 
•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Ind AS financial statements, 
including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  Ind  AS  financial  statements  represent  the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, 
related safeguards.

Annexure “B” to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Financial Statements of LIC 
Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited (Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other 
Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) 
 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") 
 
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of LIC Mutual Fund Asset 
Management Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. 
 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the 
timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
 
Auditor's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial 
reporting with reference to these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of  the 
Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively 
in all material respects. 
 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included 
 
 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to 
these  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these 
financial statements. 
 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with Reference to these Financial 
Statements 
A Company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these financial 
statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control over financial reporting with 
reference to these financial statements includes those policies and procedures that(1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made 
only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with Reference to these 
Financial Statements 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override 
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference 
to these financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
over financial reporting with reference to these financial statements may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. 
 
 
 
 
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls over 
financial reporting with reference to these financial statements and such internal financial controls  
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

1.  Company Information and Basis of preparation of financial statements 
1.1.  Company Information 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited was incorporated on April 20, 1994 under 
The Companies Act,1956. The registered and corporate office of the company is situated 
at 4th Floor, Industrial Assurance Building, Opp. Churchgate station, Mumbai – 400020.  
The principal activity of the Company is to act as an Investment management advisor to

The Company also provides portfolio management services ('PMS') to clients under 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (portfolio managers) Regulations, 1993 (as 
amended). 
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupees (INR) which 
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates. 
1.2.  Basis of preparation of financial statements 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (hereinafter referred to as "Ind AS") as notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
pursuant to section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rule, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Amendment Rules, 2016 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of

Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
2.  Significant Accounting Policies 
2.1.  Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires the management to make estimates and 
assumptions considered in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and the reported income 
and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used 
in preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Future results 
could differ from these estimates.  
i)  Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets: 
Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual value of the assets 
annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation to be recorded during any 
reporting period. The useful lives and residual values are as per Schedule II of the 
Companies Act, 2013 or are based on company’s historical experience with similar 
assets  and  considering  anticipated  technological  changes,  whichever  is  more 
appropriate. 
ii)  Income Tax: 
The company reviews at each Balance Sheet date the carrying amount of deferred 
tax assets. The factors used in estimates may defer from actual outcome which could 
lead to an adjustment to the amounts reported in the financial statements.  
iii)  Contingencies: 
Management has estimated the possible outflow of resources at the end of each 
annual reporting financial year in respect of contingencies / claims / litigations against 
the Company as it is not possible to predict the outcome of pending matters with 
accuracy. 
iv) Defined benefit obligation: 
The cost of post-employment benefit is determined using actuarial valuations. The 
actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary 
increases and mortality rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans such 
estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. 
v)  Provisions 
Provisions and liabilities are recognized in the period when it becomes probable that 
there will be a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events and 
the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated. The timing of recognition and 
quantification of the liability require the application of judgement to existing facts and 
circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions 
and liabilities are reviewed regularly and adjusted to take account of changing facts 
and circumstances.

Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
2.2.  Amendments issued by MCA: 
On 24th March 2021, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") through a notification, 
amended Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. The amendments revise Division I, 
II and III of Schedule III and are applicable from 1st April 2021. Key amendments 
relating  to  Division  III which  relate  to  companies  whose  financial  statements  are 
required to comply with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015.  
The amendments are extensive, and the Company will evaluate the same to give effect 
to them as required by law. 
2.3.  Property, plant and equipment. 
Property, Plant & Equipment are stated at cost of acquisition, including any cost 
attributable for bringing the asset to its working condition, less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Gains or losses arising from derecognition 
of property, plant and equipment are measured as difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the cost of the assets less accumulated depreciation upto the date of 
disposal  and  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  when  asset  is 
derecognised. Leasehold Improvements are shown at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation. 
Subsequent cost incurred on an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in 
the  carrying  amount  thereof  when  those  costs  meet  the  recognition  criteria  as 
mentioned above. Repairs and maintenance expenses are recognized in Profit and Loss 
account as and when incurred. 
Depreciation on Property, Plant & Equipment 
Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the straight-line method over the useful 
life of assets estimated by the management. Depreciation for assets purchased/sold 
during the year is proportionately charged. 
As per the requirement of Schedule II of The Companies Act, 2013, the company has 
evaluated the useful lives of the respective Property, Plant & Equipment which are as 
per the provisions of Part C of the Schedule II for calculating the depreciation. The 
estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows: 
Property, Plant and Equipment  Estimated Useful Life 
Furniture and fittings  10 years 
Office equipments  5 years 
Computers  3 years 
Vehicles(a)  5 years 
Leasehold improvement  Over the period of lease or useful life, whichever 
is less 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
(a) based on management estimates, the useful life as given above represents the 
period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence the useful life 
for these assets is different from the useful life as prescribed under Schedule Part C 
of II of the Companies Act, 2013. 
Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
periodically, including at each financial year end.  
2.4. Intangible assets and amortization 
Intangible  assets  comprising  of  system  softwares,  are  stated  at  cost  of  acquisition, 
including  any  cost  attributable  for  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working  condition,  less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. 
Amortization of intangible assets: 
Intangible assets are amortized using straight line method over the useful lives as under: 
 
Intangible asset  Estimated Useful Life 
Computer software  3 years 
 
2.5.  Revenue Recognition 
Revenue  (other  than  those  items  to  which  Ind  AS  109  Financial  Instruments  are 
applicable) is measured at transaction price i.e. the amount of consideration to which the 
company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised services to the 
customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The company consider 
the  terms  of  the  contract  and  its  customary  business  practices  to  determine  the 
transaction price. Where the consideration promised is variable, the Company excludes 
the estimates of variable consideration that are constrained. Ind AS 115 Revenue from 
contracts  with  customers  outlines  a  single  comprehensive  model  of accounting  for 
revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
i) Revenue from Operations 
Investment management fees are accounted on accrual basis in accordance with the 
Investment Management Agreement and are dependent on the net assets value as 
recorded by the schemes of LIC Mutual Fund. 
Portfolio management fees are recognised, on accrual basis, in accordance with the 
terms of agreement with respective clients. 
Revenue from advisory services is accounted, on accrual basis, based on the terms of 
agreement with the clients. 
 
 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
ii)  Other Income 
The profit/(loss) on sale of investments are recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss on the date of trade and determined using the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis for 
individual security. 
Interest income is recognised using the time-proportion method, based on the rate 
implicit in the transaction.  
Dividend is recognised when right to receive dividend is established. 
2.6.  Employee benefits 
i)  Short term employee benefits 
All short term employee benefits such as salaries, incentives, medical benefits which 
are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in 
which the employee renders the related services which entitles him to avail such 
benefits are recognized on an undiscounted basis and charged to the statement of 
profit and loss. 
 
Post-employment benefits: 
i)  Defined contribution plan 
Provident Fund - The Company contributes to recognised provident fund scheme, 
which is defined contribution scheme. The company has no further obligation beyond 
making the contributions. The contributions are recognised on accrual basis and 
charged to Statement of Profit and Loss. 
ii)  Defined benefit plan 
Gratuity - Gratuity for employees is covered by Gratuity Scheme with Life Insurance 
Corporation of India and the contribution thereof is paid/provided for. Provision for 
Gratuity is made on the basis of actuarial valuation on Projected Unit Credit Method 
as at the end of the year. Actuarial gain and losses are recognized in full in the other 
comprehensive income for the period in which they occur. Past service costs both 
vested and unvested is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan 
amendment  or  curtailment  occurs;  and  (b)  when  the  entity  recognises  related 
restructuring costs or termination benefits. 
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the 
present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme 
assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in the future contributions to the scheme. 
2.7.  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
A  provision  is  recognized  when  the  Company  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or 
constructive) as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. 
Provisions are not discounted to its present value and are determined based on best 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or 
a present obligation that arises from the past events where it is either not probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount 
cannot  be  made.  Information  on  contingent  liabilities  is  disclosed  in  the  financial 
statements.  
Contingent assets are not recognised, but disclosed in the financial statements, if any. 
However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is no 
longer a contingent asset, but it is recognized as an asset. 
2.8. Income taxes 
Income Tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in deferred tax 
assets  or  liabilities during  the  year.  Current  and  deferred  taxes  are  recognized  in 
statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognized in the 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax 
are also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. 
Current Income Taxes 
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the Balance 
Sheet after offsetting advance tax paid and income tax provisions arising in the same tax 
jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to settle the assets and 
liabilities on net basis.  
Deferred Income Taxes 
i)  Deferred Income tax is recognized using the Balance Sheet approach.  Deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible and taxable temporary 
differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and effects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of transaction. 
ii)  Deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry 
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
iii)  The carrying amount of deferred income taxes is reviewed at each reporting date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient profit will be available 
to allow all or part of deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
iv) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences 
are expected to be received or settled. 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
v)  Deferred tax assets or liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
 
2.9. Financials Instruments 
i)  Date of recognition 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.   
ii)  Initial measurement of financial instrument 
Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value.  Transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition 
of financial asset or financial liability. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
are recognized immediately in profit or loss. 
iii) Classification of financial instruments 
The company classifies all the financial assets based on business model for managing 
the assets and the assets contractual terms, measured at either: 
a) Financial assets at amortized cost 
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial 
assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise 
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
on principal amount outstanding. 
b) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 
if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by 
both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial 
assets. 
c) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 
Investments in mutual fund units are measured at fair value through profit or loss 
unless it is measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive 
income on initial recognition. 
 
 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
iv) Impairment of financial assets 
The company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated 
with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI debt instruments. The impairment 
methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk. 
v)  De-recognition of financial assets 
A financial asset is de-recognised only when: 
a)  The company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial 
asset or 
b)  Retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows of the financial asset but 
assumed a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. 
vi) Investment in mutual funds 
The company subsequently measures all the mutual fund investments at FVTPL as 
these financial assets do not pass the contractual cash flow test as required by Ind AS 
109 – Financial Instruments, for being designated at amortised cost or FVTOCI, hence 
classified at FVTPL. 
2.10.   Earnings per share 
Basic  earnings  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  the  net  profit  or  loss  after  tax 
attributable  to  equity  shareholders  by  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares 
outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss after tax by the 
weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per 
share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been 
issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. 
2.11.  Other financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value (net of transaction costs incurred). 
Difference    between the fair value and the transaction proceeds on initial recognition is 
recognized as an asset / liability based on underlying reason for the difference. 
 
Subsequently all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. 
 
2.12.  Offsetting financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the balance 
sheet where there is legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events 
and must be enforceable in normal course of business and in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty. 
 
LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Limited 
Notes to Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2021 
 
2.13. Leases 
The Company has applied IND AS 116 using the prospective approach. 
Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date 
at which the leased asset is available for use by the company. For leases of real estate 
for which the company is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease 
components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component. 
 
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. 
Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:  
• Fixed payments   
Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also 
included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are nted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is 
generally the case for leases in the company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is 
used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds 
necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar 
economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. 
 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:   
• The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability  
• Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received  
• any initial direct costs, and   
• Restoration costs. 
 
Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life 
and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the company is reasonably certain to 
exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying 
asset’s useful life.  
Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value 
assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. 
   
2.14. Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

2.15.  Segment Reporting 
The company’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of 
the  company  that  are  evaluated  regularly  by  the  Executive  Committee  (the  ‘Chief 
Operating Decision Maker’ as defined in lnd AS 108- ‘Operating Segments’), in deciding 
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. These have been identified 
taking into account the nature of products and services, the differing risks and returns 
and the internal business reporting systems. Basis of such evaluation, the company 
concluded it operates in a single reportable segment. 
 
2.16.  Distribution and Scheme Overrun Expenses 
i) New Fund Offer Expenses 
 
Expenses relating to the new fund offer are charged to Statement of Profit and Loss in 
the year in which such expenses are incurred.

death, the maturity/loyalty bonus stands forfeited.

I.  Fair value hierarchy
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
This section explains the judgements and estimate made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a)
recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial
statements. To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the company has classified its
financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the Indian Accounting standard. An explanation of each level is given below.
Level 1 : Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. For example: listed equity instruments that
have quoted market price.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, units of mutual fund) is
determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is
the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.
II.  Valuation techniques used to determine fair value
Significant valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
ThefairvaluesforinvestmentinmutualfundarebasedontheNetAssetValue("NAV")declaredbyrespectiveschemesandfairvalue
of security deposits are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalent, Bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unquoted
mutual fund units, other financial assets, trade payables, other financial liabilities are considered to beapproximately equal to thefair
value.
III.  Valuation Process
Thefinance department performs thecalculations of financial assets and liabilities required for financial reportingpurposes. This team
reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Discussions of valuation processes and results are held between the CFO and the
finance team at least once in a month.
Quoted mutual fund investment have been categorised into level 1 (recurring fair value measurement) and unquoted mutual fund
investments are categorised into level 2 of fair value hierarchy. Unlisted equity shares are included in level 3.
IV.  Fair value of financial instrument measured at amortised cost 
Fair value of Financial asset and liabilities are equal to their carrying amount.
Note :
During the periods mentioned above, there have been no transfer amongst the levels of hierarchy.
