Foreword
Jean-Jacques Barbéris
Executive Committee Member,  
Head of ESG
As a responsible asset manager since its creation in 2010, Amundi has been 
deeply committed to integrating Environmental, Social and Governance factors 
in  its  investment  processes  and  supporting  sustainable  transitions  through 
an  ambitious  stewardship  policy,  sustainable  investing  strategies  geared 
towards climate mitigation and social cohesion, and sustainable capital market 
development.
Climate Change is arguably the greatest challenge of our times. Exacerbated 
by human activities, it presents itself as one of the greatest systemic risks for 
society with long-lasting impact for investors and financial actors. One of the 
first meetings organized to address this challenge took place at The Rockefeller 
Foundation Bellagio Center in April 2011, organized by Columbia University and 
Amundi sponsored Sovereign Wealth Fund Research Initiative. 
A key outcome of this meeting was the decision by some participants to take 
the historic step to start decarbonizing portfolios. The meeting eventually led 
to the creation in 2014 of the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, co-founded by 
Amundi, to align Institutional Investment portfolios with a low carbon economy.
Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, we have strengthened our ambition to support 
climate action across geographies and asset classes. Our success and continued 
progress on this front has been possible through the strategic partnerships forged 
with the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation, the European 
Investment Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and through the 
support of our clients across the world.

Acknowledging that there is an urgent need to accelerate the transition towards 
global net zero emissions, Amundi was proud to join the Net Zero Asset Managers 
Initiative this year, committing to supporting the goal of net zero emissions by 
2050.
By joining the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative Amundi not only embraces global 
carbon neutrality objectives, but is actively taking action to accelerate investing 
aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. This is a key milestone in 
Amundi’s commitment to climate leadership, and as we embark on this journey 
with reinforced climate ambition, here are the key convictions that will guide our 
action:
– The financial sector is a key catalyst for action - While maintaining a 
stringent sector policy to phase out coal, we will focus on supporting net-zero 
aligned investment across sectors and regions, and on ensuring investors 
are equipped with efficient and ambitious climate investment strategies 
supporting global neutrality. 
– Change must be embraced at every layer of the organization - Amundi will 
not only align its own operations with global carbon neutrality objectives, 
but will ensure that this mission is shared throughout the organization, 
empowering staff to be actors of change.
– Transition will need to be socially just and respectful of our environment 
- COP26 will be held in a context marked by the social and economic fallout 
from the sanitary crisis. We are convinced of the need to achieve a low-carbon 
transition that is socially acceptable, and have co-founded “Investors for a 
Just Transition”, the first investor coalition on the just transition, to support 
collaborative efforts addressing this complex challenge. 
– Knowledge, data and analytics are significant drivers of change - Aligning 
financial flows with carbon neutrality objectives requires significant 
improvement in our ability to integrate climate change risk, transition 
opportunities, and adverse impact on sustainability factors, when allocating 
capital. From value chain carbon data, to implied temperature ratings and 
exposure to physical risks, companies and investors have a common interest  
in building meaningful and reliable analytics.
– Engaging companies on a climate-neutral path will remain a key pillar of our 
climate strategy. We fully integrate the emissions’ trajectory of the companies 
we invest in in our ESG analysis. Amundi also encourages companies to have 
increased transparency on their strategy to reduce emissions, and deeper 
public commitments on carbon emissions reduction plans, by notably 
declaring an alignment objective with the Paris agreements under the 
Science-Based Targets framework.
This report details Amundi’s ambitions, analysis, practices and operational setup 
to tackle climate change. It is also meant to become a key reference document to 
present Amundi’s ESG and Climate initiatives to all stakeholders.
We wish you a good read and look forward for the 2021 edition.

Governance
2020 Climate Report |7
Governance
Acting as a responsible financial institution is a core commitment of Amundi’s 
strategy.  This  commitment  is  reflected  in  its  responsible  management 
approach  and  is  integrated  throughout  its  governance  structure.  The 
accountability and responsibilities for meeting its ESG – including climate – 
objectives are therefore integrated into executive and manage ment roles as 
well as remuneration policies. 
In doing so, Amundi has integrated ESG into the core of its management approach and has introduced 
a dedicated governance structure that has been designed to implement and monitor Responsible 
Investment within the Group with a strong consideration of climate change impacts. 
As such, ESG at Amundi is governed through dedicated committees reporting to the board and executive 
committee. It has a dedicated Business Line with 4 teams to limit the exposures of its portfolios to ESG 
and climate-related risks and to design strategies that aim to pursue climate-related opportunities.

Strategy
Climate change and ESG-related considerations are central to all decisions 
taken by Amundi. This is driven by its conviction that companies and investors 
have a responsibility in building a more sustainable society and that ESG 
has a positive impact on long-term financial performance through strategic 
management of ESG-related risks and opportunities. 
As such, since its creation in 2010, Amundi has been deeply committed to integrating Environmental, 
Social and Governance factors in its investment processes and supporting sustainable transitions 
through an ambitious engagement policy, sustainable capital market development and the mobilization 
of capital globally. Amundi has placed ESG and climate-related financial risks and opportunities at the 
heart of its raison d’être which is to be a trusted partner working every day in the interest of its clients 
and society. 
Over the past decade, Amundi has been an active and long-standing player in Responsible Investing. 
In 2006, Amundi became a co-founding signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). In 
the early 2010s, Amundi collaborated with a major index provider to launch some of the earliest low-
carbon indices. In 2014, Amundi co-founded the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, alongside the United 
Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), to support this objective. In recent years, the 
development of internal climate analytics and research teams has strengthened Amundi's ability to design 
climate business solutions for its clients and expand the availability of ESG-related funds.

Risks
Rooted in Amundi’s belief that considering long-term risks that can affect 
performance is a matter of fiduciary duty, assessment of climate risks at Amundi 
consists of a robust and ongoing process of stakeholder consultation, research, 
and application. Having identified climate change as an increasingly material 
impact on portfolio assets, Amundi has set ambitious targets for 2021 to 
implement the widespread integration of ESG criteria in its investment practices.
The inclusion of ESG risk factors in products and strategy is a key matter. In the past years, Amundi has 
both strengthened and broadened its approach to embedding the identification and assessment of 
physical and transition climate-related risks into the investment strategy. As a testament to Amundi’s 
dedication as a responsible investor, 100% of open-ended funds now include ESG criteria (when an 
ESG-rating methodoloy can be applied). To strengthen this commitment further, Amundi’s ambition for 
the end of 2021 is for these funds to outperform their respective portfolio benchmark universe in terms 
of ESG rating. In addition, Amundi has exceeded its objective to increase the number of issuers covered 
in its ESG analysis from 5,000 to 8,000: the number of issuers covered at the end of 2020 was 10,000. 
Furthermore, integrating ESG criteria for the general risk management processes is a key matter for 
Amundi. This process relies on a dedicated ESG business line to ensure that ESG approaches follow best 
practices in a fast-moving space, providing guidance on rating, assessment and scoring methodologies. 
Beyond these dedicated teams, Amundi has embedded ESG analysis directly into its portfolio management 
systems, across all investment platforms used by Portfolio Managers and investment analysts. In addition, 
ESG criteria are also embedded within Amundi’s control frameworks, with the Risk teams playing a key role 
in approving investment strategies and corresponding constraints.

Metrics and Targets
Amundi has determined metrics and targets to effectively identify, qualify 
and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Using a wide range of 
metrics, Amundi is able to set targets in the short, medium, and long-term. 
In the past year, Amundi has worked to increase the variety of metrics used to integrate climate-related 
risks and opportunities. These include portfolio temperature scores and Paris Agreement alignment 
metrics, in addition to green and brown share metrics. As complementary tools to carbon footprint 
transition risk calculations, introducing these new indicators will provide Amundi a more forward-
looking and complete perspective of the climate-related investment portfolio performance. Amundi is 
indeed continuing to refine its approach by using a wide range of data providers and methodologies, 
as well as participating in emerging methodologies such as the new temperature scores developed by 
CDP and the WWF.

Methodology for calculating the coal exposure of portfolios 
under management 
Based on data supplied by Trucost, Amundi identifies the issuers having activity (electricity generation, 
extraction) linked to thermal coal.
In the absence of Trucost data, a rate of 0% is allocated to companies not identified as being linked 
to coal (as a result of the sector in particular) or otherwise the percentage declared by the company 
(public report, website or direct information).
Two indicators are calculated, the methodology of which is detailed below:
Weighted exposure of portfolios in billions of euros
For each of the issuers identified, its coal exposure (i.e. the percentage of revenue from coal-related 
activities) is multiplied by the amount invested in the company in question:
ni  Company’s exposure (€) x X% of coal in the sales revenue of the company
i i
Proportion of portfolios exposed to thermal coal as %
The weighted exposure of portfolios is compared to the total amount of Amundi Group investments  
in order to calculate the share of portfolios exposed to thermal coal:
ni  Company’s exposure (€) x X% of coal in the sales revenue of the company
i i
Total amount of Amundi Group investments
These methodologies apply to the perimeter of assets covered
