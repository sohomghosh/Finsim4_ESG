II - MANAGEMENT REPORT 
 
a)   Investment guidelines 
 
■  Economic and financial environment 
 
While global growth slowed in 2019, recording its weakest growth since the economic and financial crisis of 
2008/2009, it was hit hard by the coronavirus epidemic in the first quarter of 2020. It came at a time when global 
activity showed encouraging signs of stabilisation after being affected by the China-US trade war and the 
prolonged uncertainty associated with Brexit. The Covid-19 pandemic dashed the hopes raised by the signing of 
the "Phase 1" trade agreement between the United States and China on 15 January and the signing of the divorce 
agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union on 24 January, allowing Brexit to take place on 
31 January at midnight and the opening of a transition period until the end of 2020. Government containment 
efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19 brought a sharp and abrupt halt to global activity. In the face of an 
unprecedented shock, the authorities responded swiftly and overwhelmingly to the health and economic crisis. 
Governments announced healthcare measures and broad economic support plans to prevent a surge in corporate 
failures. Central banks lowered their interest rates and/or announced massive purchases of financial assets. In 
this way, they confronted governments to absorb the anticipated sharp rise in public debt and to ensure that 
financing conditions were maintained that were highly advantageous to households, businesses, banks and 
governments. These measures are needed to mitigate the impact of the shock on activity and enable a faster 
recovery when the health crisis is over, but they are insufficient to prevent the global economy from plunging into 
a deep recession. Its magnitude will depend on the duration and severity of the health crisis and the way out of 
it. According to the IMF, the global economy is expected to experience its worst recession since the Great 
Depression. Deteriorating growth prospects and central banks' adoption of more accommodative monetary 
policies contributed to the sharp rebound in bond rates throughout the year. Stock markets, which had been driven 
by the prospect and then the announcement of a Phase 1 trade agreement between China and the US since 
October 2019, literally collapsed from the end of February to record a sharp decline for the year as a whole. 
 
The Covid-19 epidemic began in China in December 2019, spreading to Europe during the second half of 
February 2020, affecting Italy, before spreading to Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the 
United States during March. The containment measures taken by the authorities to try to limit the spread of the 
epidemic and the number of victims have resulted in a collapse in activity, particularly in the service sector due to 
the significant impact of social distancing measures in catering, hospitality, tourism, air transport and trade. This 
has amplified the contraction in the manufacturing sector, which was already weakened by the impact of the trade 
war on world trade, owing to plant closures and major disruptions in global supply chains. The sharp and abrupt 
halt in activity also resulted in a collapse of global trade, visible through the plunge in the sea-freight index and 
new foreign orders. Economies face a supply shock and then a demand shock from containment measures that 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
8 
 
will have a significant impact on global growth, as all countries are allocated months, if not weeks, of intervals. 
Limited data were available at the end of March to measure the initial effects of the epidemic on growth. However, 
INSEE estimates for France may provide a first indication for developed countries. The institute estimates that 
the French economy was running at 65% of its capacity at the end of March, and that a month of containment 
would reduce annual growth by 3% of GDP, and that two months of containment would reduce it by 6%, which is 
considerable. 
 
The United States was hit by the outbreak of coronavirus in March 2020, as growth reached the end of 
the cycle and showed signs of slowdown, notably related to the impact of the trade war. The most affected 
states have adopted containment measures such as those in New York and California. This has had an 
unprecedented  impact  on  activity  and  consequently  on  the  labour  market.  The  dramatic  rise  in  weekly 
unemployment claims during the last two weeks of March provided were the first indication. They amounted to 
3.3 million the week of 21 March and 6.65 million the week of 28 March, a far cry from the previous historical peak 
of 695,000 reached the week of 1 October 1982. Following almost a year of stabilisation, this bodes for a dramatic 
rise in the unemployment rate to a 50-year low and a sharp recession. The impact will be greater in April, given 
the extension of social distancing measures until the end of the month and their adoption in a larger number of 
states. In the face of the health and economic crisis, the government has adopted a plan to support the economy 
with an historic amount of $300 billion for households and businesses (representing about 11% of GDP). Given 
the scale of the crisis, a new plan is already under discussion. 
 
In the eurozone, growth, which had slowed down to stabilise at a low level in early 2020, was severely 
affected by the Covid-19 epidemic. As a result, the eurozone is entering a deep recession after coming close 
to recession in some countries in the past year, such as Italy and Germany. Germany has been hit heavily by 
growing trade tensions between the US and China, owing to its larger manufacturing sector and its greater 
reliance on foreign trade. The German economy thus narrowly escaped a technical recession in 2019, which was 
also affected by the continuing problems in the automotive sector and the fears of Brexit. France performed well 
because of a budgetary policy that favours domestic demand and reduced exposure to foreign trade. While growth 
in the eurozone seemed to be stabilising at around 1% in 2020, the halt in activity, linked to the containment 
measures adopted during the second half of March (since 9 March in Italy), foreshadowed a deep recession. The 
activity index of the PMI/Markit survey literally plunged in March to record its biggest monthly decline by far, and 
to a record-low, much lower than that seen during the economic and financial crisis of 2008/2009. All countries 
were affected, particularly Italy as it was the first economy to be hit by coronavirus and to put in place containment 
measures. The Bank of France has given a first estimate of the impact of social distancing measures adopted 
since 17 March at noon: French GDP could contract by 6% by the first quarter. The decline will be even stronger 
in the second quarter due to the extension of these measures at least until the end of April. 
 
In the United Kingdom, the coronavirus epidemic has upstaged Brexit concerns. The three successive 
deferrals of the Brexit date, initially set on 29 March 2019, prolonged the uncertainty and weighed further on 
corporate investment and growth. Theresa May was forced to resign, and the overwhelming victory of Boris 
Johnson's Conservative Party in the early general election on 12 December allowed the UK-EU withdrawal 
agreement, which was partly renegotiated, to be ratified and the UK was set to leave the European Union at 
midnight on 31 January. A transitional period opened until the end of December 2020, unless it was extended, 
during which economic relations between the UK and the European Union will remain unchanged. The signing of 
the withdrawal agreement is only a first step in the process of leaving the European Union. The second will be far 
more complex, because it is about determining their future relationships, and Boris Johnson's statements in 
February raised fears of a hard Brexit in late 2020. In March, while the containment measures taken by the 
authorities were rather late in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus, the impact on activity was very significant, 
as revealed in the latest PMI/Markit survey. The index for the whole economy has fallen to a historical low due 
mainly to the drop in service sector activity. 
 
To deal with the health and economic crisis, European Union governments have adopted economic 
support plans totalling 3% of the EU's GDP and have provided loan guarantees and deferrals of charges and 
taxes equivalent to 16% of GDP. Given the exceptional nature of the health crisis, the Eurogroup temporarily 
suspended the rules of the stability and growth pact for the first time, including a budget deficit of less than 3% of 
GDP, and the European Commission eased state aid rules for firms in difficulty. Discussions will resume in April 
on the adoption of broader and more substantial government measures at EU level.

In Japan, while growth was weakened by the trade war between China and the United States, it was 
affected by the rise in the VAT rate and the impact of Covid-19. The Government decided to implement the 
increase in the VAT rate (from 8% to 10%) on 1 October. This led to a collapse in household consumption at the 
end of the year, leading the government to adopt a massive stimulus package, owing to the Bank of Japan's 
limited room for manoeuvre. As a result, GDP recorded its largest decline in five years in the last quarter of 2019, 
when the VAT rate rose by 7.1% annually in the quarter. The consequences of the Covid-19 crisis will deepen its 
contraction in the first half of 2020. This led the government to announce measures to reduce the epidemic's 
impact on business, and the Bank of Japan injected liquidity through purchases of financial assets. 
 
Growth slowing in emerging economies was hit hard by the consequences of Covid-19. In China, this 
epidemic occurred as the economy underwent its structural slowdown to record its weakest growth since 
1992 (6% year-over-year in the 4th quarter). This results from the rebalancing of growth in favour of consumption 
and services, at the expense of investment and manufacturing. Moreover, the slowdown was exacerbated by the 
clear shift of trend in exports in the wake of America's sharp tariff rise. In December, the coronavirus epidemic 
broke out in China in the city of Wuhan, an industrial area home to many multinational companies. Containment 
measures were taken rather late in January. Such measures were radical and resulted in a paralysis of much of 
the activity affecting global supply chains and international trade. The impact on Chinese activity was severe in 
January and February, justifying the adoption of large-scale measures by the government and the central bank. 
In March, the gradual lifting of containment outside Wuhan led to a rebound in surveys of business leaders, but 
recovery is slow. The slowdown in China's economy and then the collapse of global activity in early 2020 
had a significant impact on emerging countries. The fall in world trade, commodity prices and tourism in early 
2020 led central banks to cut interest rates sharply and governments to adopt massive support schemes. In 
addition to the impact of the health crisis on growth, emerging countries have experienced massive capital 
outflows from investors due to high risk aversion, particularly in heavily indebted countries. The IMF and the World 
Bank have provided financial assistance to emerging countries to combat Covid-19 and called for a suspension 
of debt payments from heavily indebted poor countries. The Fed has reactivated swap lines with other central 
banks and adopted other measures to facilitate access to increasingly difficult dollar financing. 
 
Moreover, emerging oil-producing countries were severely weakened by the March 2020 drop in the price 
of black gold, owing to declining global demand and the absence of an agreement between Saudi Arabia 
and Russia to reduce oil production. In the absence of an agreement at the OPEC+ meeting on 6 March, Saudi 
Arabia launched a price war that resulted in a collapse in oil prices, particularly weakening heavily indebted US 
shale producers. Between 5 March and 31 March 2020, Brent's barrel price dropped by 56%, from $51.3 to $22.6, 
and returned to its lowest level since early 2002. It registered a fall of 67% over a year. 
 
This sharp decline in oil prices suggests a substantial slowdown in inflation. The latter remained below the 
central  bank target, owing  to  moderate  internal  demand  dynamics. In  the  United  States,  the  household 
expenditure deflator in February 2020 was 1.8% for the overall and underlying indices (excluding food and 
energy). In the eurozone, inflation stood at 0.7% in March 2020 and 1% for the underlying index, far short of the 
ECB's target of near but below 2% inflation. 
 
In the face of risks affecting growth, central banks have become more accommodating. The Federal 
Reserve (Fed) made a 180-degree about-turn in 2019. While US growth continued at a moderate pace, it cut 
rates by 25 basis points three times: 31 July, 18 September and 30 October. The range of changes in Fed 
Fund interest rates has been reduced to [1.50; 1.75%]. It acted preventively in the face of the risks 
associated with the intensification of trade tensions and slowdown in global growth in the context of 
inflation that has fallen below the 2% target. In March 2020, the collapse of activity due to Covid-19 led it to 
lower its interest rates swiftly and sharply: -50 basis points (bps) on 3 March, and -100 bps on 15 March, to 
bring the Fed Funds rate range back to between [0 and 0.25%]. It has also resumed its purchases of bonds 
and mortgages for an unlimited duration and amount by integrating corporate bonds for the first time. It has 
also adopted a range of measures designed to provide the liquidity needed to run the economy. Finally, 
to avoid a shortage of dollars at the international level, the Fed reactivated swap agreements with major 
central banks and adopted a new initiative on 31 March. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also made 
monetary policy even more accommodative in the face of growth risks and persistently low inflation. On 12 
September, it adopted a whole set of measures. The deposit rate was reduced by 10 basis points to -
0.50%, and a tiering mechanism was adopted with the intention of reducing the negative impact on banks. 
The ECB also decided to resume its purchases of financial assets, which it had stopped in December 
2018, at the rate of €20 billion per month from 1 November 2019. In the face of the health crisis, the ECB 
has taken far-reaching steps. The main ones were the announcement of an additional envelope of €120 
billion, until at least the end of 2020, intended mainly for the purchase of corporate bonds. It has also 
launched the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) for an amount of €750 billion, which is 
intended to run at least until the end of 2020. It will be used with great flexibility, as evidenced by the 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
10 
 
removal of the maximum holding limit of 33% per issuer and per issue set in previous programmes. The 
ECB has clearly signalled its strong and unlimited commitment to preserving the integrity of the 
eurozone. The central bank is thus assisting governments to absorb the anticipated sharp rise in public 
debt and keep interest rates low for all eurozone countries, even those with high public debt, such as 
Italy and Greece. 
 
Finally, in an attempt to reduce the impact of the health crisis on growth, the Bank of England lowered its interest 
rate by 65 basis points in March 2020 to 0.1%. It also announced a resumption of purchases of financial assets 
worth an additional £200 billion, and adopted measures to facilitate liquidity access for firms facing cash-flow 
difficulties. 
 
Financial markets 
 
Sovereign bond rates have eased significantly over the past year due to the rapid deterioration in 
prospects for global growth and the adoption of more accommodative monetary policies. 
 
The rate-lowering movement took place in two stages, interrupted by a phase of slight upswing in the last 
quarter of 2019. 
The relaxation that started in October 2018 continued until the end of August 2019. It was driven by rising 
uncertainty stemming from the intensification of the trade war between China and the United States, as 
well as the rapid deterioration of global business prospects. It continued with the anticipation and then the 
announcement of a more accommodative monetary policy by the Fed and the ECB. In August 2019, bond markets 
also benefited from a flight to quality related to the sharp escalation of the trade war. Investors preferred to take 
refuge in safer assets (sovereign bonds) at the expense of riskier securities (equities). In Italy, investors were 
reassured in August by the collapse of the ruling coalition and the exit of the far-right League party led by Matteo 
Salvini. The formation of a new government between the 5 Star Movement and the Democratic Party has reduced 
fears of financial slippage, which has led to a sharp relaxation of Italian rates. 
 
From September to December, long rates tended to strengthen slightly and remain low. Profit-taking and 
then a reduction in fears about the global economy were at the root of this. Investors were reassured by the 
announcement, on 11 October, of a possible Phase 1 agreement between China and the United States, and by 
the stabilisation of market surveys. 
 
From the end of January 2020, long rates started a strong relaxation movement. The announcement on 22 
January of the quarantine of Wuhan (11 million people), where the coronavirus outbreak began in December, 
generated fears about Chinese growth and, by implication, global growth. Subsequently, the rapid and strong 
spread of the coronavirus epidemic outside China generated a genuine panic in financial markets and amplified 
interest-rate relaxation. Their decline worsened on 9 March, following the collapse of stock markets caused by 
the historic fall in oil prices. This has brought American, German and British rates to record lows, with the US 10-
year rate at 0.50%, the British 10-year rate at 0.17%, and the German 10-year rate at -0.84%. The French 10-
year rate is back on the lowest historical rate reached in August 2019, at -0.42%. Subsequently, bond markets 
proved volatile despite aggressive actions by central banks, particularly the Fed. In the eurozone, the ECB's 
announcements of 12 March, including an additional €120 billion intended mainly for the purchase of corporate 
bonds, did not have the expected effect on the markets. Rates have been strained following a miscommunication 
by Christine Lagarde, who has been the head of the ECB since November, that the central bank's mission is not 
to reduce interest-rate spreads in some countries relative to Germany (spreads). Diametrically opposed to his 
predecessor Mario Draghi's famous mantra "whatever it takes", it has raised doubts about the central bank's 
commitment to do everything to preserve the eurozone's integrity. Peripheral countries' rates, led by Greece and 
Italy, have been sharply stretched, causing all sovereign rates to follow. This communication error was quickly 
corrected, in particular with the announcement of the pandemic emergency plan on 18 March shortly before 
midnight, and a strong message from the ECB on its unlimited determination to preserve the integrity of the 
eurozone. These measures allowed rates to relax and return to mid-March levels. Italy's 10-year spread over 
Germany, which peaked at 320 basis points in the session on 18 March, quickly returned to mid-March levels. 
 
In total, the 10-year US rate fell by 175 basis points over the entire year, to close at 0.67% on 31 March. The 
German 10-year rate fell by 39 bps, to close at -0.46%, and the French 10-year rate by 31 bps, to close at -0.05%. 
The rates of the peripheral countries were very popular before the Covid-19 crisis by investors seeking returns. 
The Greek 10-year rate fell by 200 bps over the past year, and the Italian 10-year rate by nearly 100 bps, closing 
at 2.11% and 1.55% respectively on 31 March 2020.

Equity markets have plummeted in the prospect of a strong global recession following the Covid-19 
epidemic. 
 
The equity markets have followed three distinct phases over the past year. 
 
Until September 2019, they remained uncertain about trade tensions between China and the US. They 
have thus alternated between phases of decline, when tariff increases were announced, and rise, when the two 
powers resumed negotiations. 
 
From  11  October,  the  stock  markets  rose  sharply  until  mid-February  2020.  This  followed  the 
announcement of a partial trade agreement between China and the US, which will be ratified on 15 January, 
and the adoption of more accommodative monetary policies by the Fed and the ECB. Markets were also 
reassured in January by signs of stabilising global activity through market surveys. The US Standard & Poor's 
index thus peaked in mid-February at a new record high, and the CAC 40 index was above the 6,000-point limit, 
for only the third time in 20 years. 
 
The announcement, over the weekend of 22 February, of a strong and rapid spread of the coronavirus 
epidemic outside China, particularly in Iran and Italy, generated panic in the financial markets. Equity 
markets then started a real downfall, owing to fears of a global recession and investors' flight from risky markets 
to markets deemed safer, such as government bonds. Volatility in equity markets has risen sharply to one of its 
highest levels in many years. The oil-price war, launched on 8 March by Saudi Arabia, the miscommunication by 
Christine Lagarde on 12 March, which was quickly corrected, and the announcement of containment measures 
in several European countries, have accentuated the plunge in the indices. Between 21 February and 23 March, 
the Standard & Poor's index fell by 33%, the Eurostoxx 50 index by 34.6% and the CAC 40 by 35.1%. Aggressive 
and rapid interventions by central banks, including the resumption of purchases of financial assets, and massive 
support plans announced by governments have enabled stock markets to resume somewhat during the last six 
sessions in March to reduce only a small portion of their heavy losses. 
 
Throughout the year, the Standard & Poor's index fell by 8.8%, the Eurostoxx 50 index by 16.9% and the CAC 
40 index by 17.8%. In the United Kingdom, the Footsie 100 index fell by 22.1%, with the health crisis adding to 
the persistent uncertainty of Brexit. In Japan, the Nikkei index fell by 10.8%. 
 
■  Management policy 
 
The health crisis resulted in severe volatility on the financial markets in the last few days of the last financial year 
and into the new financial year; liquidity has diminished sharply and volatility has surged considerably. In 
accordance with our swing pricing policy and in order to protect the Ostrum Sovereign Euro unitholders, we have 
been forced to adjust both our trigger thresholds and the margins on net asset values. This could be seen as 
volatility in net asset values; but it only appears that way, because an investor that remained invested over the 
period would not be affected at all. Indeed, these changes in net asset value apply only on the day when strong 
movements of liabilities impact the SICAV. 
 
According to our allocation calculations, the gross performance of the SICAV compared to its index over the period 
breaks down as follows: 
 
Performance  Fund  Index  Difference 
Total (Gross)  4.24%  4.48%  -0.25% 
Duration      +0.13% 
Curve     +0.40% 
Country     -0.39% 
Other effects     -0.14% 
 
Modified duration: 
 
At the beginning of June, we increased our duration at the level of -0.20% (German 10-year rate) to return to 
neutrality at the level of -0.30%. We have also maintained our strategy to flatten the German curve. 
We increased our duration in July to reach an exposure of 103.6% on 31 July. We have maintained this 
overexposure between 103% and 106% until October. Germany's 10-year rate reached a new record-low of -
0.44% at the end of July, driving the 2-10-year rate spread to flatten to 33 bps on 31 July. We have also maintained 
our strategy to flatten the euro curve.

The European and American rate cuts were fuelled by the trade war between China and the United States, and 
the speeches of central bankers at the Sintra conferences in July and the Jackson Hole conferences in August 
suggest that interest rates will be lowered. The German rate again sought a lower rate at -0.70% in August, rising 
again in September and ending the third quarter at -0.57%. 
At the beginning of November, we reduced our duration from 104% to close the year to at 102%. The German 
10-year rate rose from -0.57% at the end of September to -0.18%. The risk of a global recession has receded. 
Global manufacturing activity has stabilised, and uncertainty about global trade prospects has eased with the 
announcement of a US-China "Phase 1" trade agreement scheduled for 15 January. The hike comes after central 
banks' status quo following three Fed rate cuts since July, and no further easing by the ECB after Christine 
Lagarde's first meeting. 
We increased our duration to 105% at the end of the month on the back of fears that global growth would slow 
following the emergence of coronavirus in China and the confinement of an artery of the Chinese economy. The 
German rate fell again to close the month at -0.43%. 
 
We increased our duration throughout the month to accompany our anticipation of a rate drop on the impact of 
coronavirus on the European economy and with the second objective of covering our peripheral exposures. Our 
duration was 110% at the end of February, when the German 10-year rate was -0.60%. 
We increased our duration again in early March to accompany the decline in rates upstream of the coronavirus 
impacts on the European economy and also to hedge our peripheral exposures. Beyond 9 March, hedging 
through the purchase of German debt stopped working. Investors abandoned all financial products to build up 
liquidity. The rate curves steepened. We therefore reduced our duration mid-month to increase it again at the end 
of the month at higher rate levels. The German 10-year rate thus rose from -0.60% to -0.47% with a lower rate of 
-0.85% and a higher rate of -0.19%. 
 
Management of the SICAV's overall modified duration, in proportion to the index, and rate changes: 
 
These duration and curve strategies positively impacted the relative performance of the SICAV at 53 bps. 
 
Country exposure: 
 
Throughout the 2019 period, we looked for opportunities to increase our yield exposures. 
In June, we reinforced our peripheral exposures by buying Spanish debt. We also bought Portuguese debt. We 
also entered into a diversification strategy by buying 1% of Greece 3.5% 30/01/2023 at the rate of 1.05%. 
At the beginning of July, we ended our underexposure to Italian debt by entering the Italy 2022 portfolio. In Spain, 
we reduced our exposure to agencies by increasing maturities by buying Spain 2029 and selling FADE 2020. 
At the end of July, the distortion of the curve led us to refocus on the long-term securities that make up the 
benchmark. For example, we bought securities up to maturity in 2117, bought from Belgium and France 2050 
maturities and sold from Germany 2046. 
After S&P raised Spain's rating, we took advantage of tension over the 30-year spread against Germany to 
increase our weighting on long-term Spanish and Portuguese debt. At the end of September, our positive view of 
the German agencies led us to buy from the KFW 0% 30/09/2026 by selling from the DBR 0% 15/08/2026. The 
spread provided 30 bps of additional throughput. 
At the beginning of the last quarter of 2019, we increased the peripheral allocation by selling 9.2M from Spain 
2027 at the rate of 0.02%, a sale from Spain 2046 at the rate of 1.05% and a sale from Portugal at the rate of 
1.06%. We reinvested cash in German debt 2029 and 2050 at a rate of -0.41% and 0.09%. 
In November, the resumption of QE may have been the trigger for sales of peripheral loans in addition to profit-
taking. Surveys show that investors have reduced their position on the lowest-rated debts. In this context of 
peripheral debt spread, we maintained our peripheral allocation over the period. 
At the end of the year, we reduced our exposure to Austrian, Belgian and French debt by selling long-term 
maturities to refocus on German debt. During the period, we maintained our exposure to peripheral debt, which 
recovered to October levels relative to Germany. 
At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, we moved to neutrality on French debt by purchasing long-term 
maturities. We also increased our exposure to peripheral debt by buying Spanish and Greek government bonds. 
At the end of February, we halved our overweighting of Spanish debt following the rapid spread of the Chinese 
virus and its consequences on the economies of the eurozone countries. 
In March 2020, Christine Lagarde's first speech was not reassuring; rates rose, our hedging was no longer 
functioning, and we were underexposed to Spanish debt on top of our Portuguese and Greek exposures, with 
Spanish debt being the most liquid. Christine Lagarde then announced on 18 March a $750 billion plan, which 
reassured the financial markets. We have in fact ended our Spanish underexposure.

Outlook: 
 
After a brutal start to the year with rising geopolitical tensions, global uncertainty is now reigning. The international 
community is closely monitoring the health situation, but it remains unstable. Covid-19 has had a strong recessive 
impact on the global economy. Financial markets have evolved as the virus evolves and the authorities' responses 
have been met. 
 
The rapid spread of the virus throughout the world has caused serious concerns and uncertainties in financial 
markets. 
The VIX index has reached one of its highest levels in recent years. Yields on government bonds have reached 
historic lows, and global stock-market indices that had resisted the outbreak suddenly plummeted, owing to the 
virus's impact on a large number of sectors: air transport, tourism, automobiles, electronics, energy and consumer 
services. 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic caused global activity to collapse. Recession is taking hold. Confinement measures have 
had a high economic cost. The global employment outlook is rapidly deteriorating. In the United States, three 
million Americans are now unemployed, i.e. 2% of jobs are disappearing. 
 
The fiscal response from central banks, as well as governments, has been immediate: the question now is 
whether all of these measures will be sufficient.

For more information, please consult the KIID for this UCI and specifically the "Risk and reward profile" section 
or its prospectus, available on request from the Management Company. 
 
■  Cash management 
 
The Portfolio Management Company has established a liquidity management policy for its open-ended UCIs, 
based on measures and indicators of illiquidity and impact on portfolios in the event of forced sales following 
massive  redemptions  by  investors.  Measurements  are  taken  at  a  frequency  appropriate  to  the  type  of 
management, according to various simulated redemption scenarios, and are compared to predefined alert 
thresholds. Collateral liquidity is monitored weekly using identical parameters. 
 
Those UCIs identified as being in a sensitive situation, having recorded low liquidity levels or impact pursuant to 
a forced sale, are subject to additional analyses on their liabilities, with the frequency of these tests changing 
depending on the management techniques used and/or the markets in which the UCIs invest. At the very least, 
the results of these analyses are presented during a governance committee meeting. 
 
The Management Company thus relies on a monitoring and supervisory scheme that ensures fair treatment of 
investors. 
Any change to this policy during the year that has an effect on the UCI documentation will be indicated in the 
section of this document on "significant changes". 
 
■  Handling of non-liquid assets 
 
This UCI is not affected. 
 
d)  Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") criteria 
 
Committed to sustainable development and responsible financing for over 30 years, Ostrum Asset Management 
positions itself as an ESG leader by fully integrating non-financial dimensions into all of its management processes 
and offering its clients responsible investment solutions that meet the specificities of their ESG philosophies and 
ambitions. 
Ostrum Asset Management has been a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment 
(UN-PRI1) since 2008. On the occasion of this 11th anniversary, the quality and ambition of our approach to 
responsible investment were once again recognised and praised by excellent ratings (A+ scores for all classes 
of assets under management) on all the modules to which we are subject.

At Ostrum AM, we are committed to understanding the issues of responsible development and their impact on 
the different issuers. Moreover, Ostrum AM has placed Commitment at the heart of its Responsible Investor 
approach, which is why we actively participate in the general meetings and strive to maintain constructive 
discussions with our stakeholders. 
Thus, Ostrum AM's ambition for responsible management naturally leads to an increasing number of employees, 
with different levels of responsibility and activities, involved in the implementation of this same ambition. 
 
I.  EXCLUSION POLICIES APPLIED TO OUR WHOLE 
INVESTMENT UNIVERSE 
 
As a responsible asset manager, Ostrum Asset Management refuses to support sectors or issuers that fail to 
observe certain fundamental principles of responsibility. This is in fact crucial to ensuring the credibility of our 
responsible approach and our fiduciary responsibility towards our customers. Accordingly, we have drafted 
various exclusion policies deployed across all our investment universes, as illustrated below. 
 
Excluding controversial companies by establishing sector-specific exclusion policies 
As part of its commitment to CSR, Ostrum Asset Management has defined and implemented various sector-
specific policies within its direct scope of investment: 
 
•  Blacklisted states: Ostrum AM does not invest in countries that are subject to US or European embargoes 
or identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as having strategic deficiencies in their anti-money 
laundering and terrorist financing systems. We also exclude sovereign issuers whose SDG Index score (see 
below) is less than 46. 
 
•  Cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines. In accordance with the Ottawa Convention and the Oslo Treaty 
signed by numerous countries, including France, Ostrum Asset Management excludes from all its portfolios 
any parties involved in the production, use, stockpiling, sale and transfer of anti-personnel mines and cluster 
bombs. 
 
•  Policy on the coal sector and mountaintop removal. In line with its parent company Natixis, and in the 
context of its work to promote the energy transition, Ostrum AM excludes from its investment universe 
companies that are heavily invested in the production and mining of coal or companies that use so-called 
"mountaintop removal" (MTR) coal extraction methods. 
 
•  Tobacco: Ostrum Asset Management is committed to no longer supporting the highly controversial tobacco 
sector as its social, societal and environmental impacts are particularly negative and to do so would run 
contrary to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This policy has been in effect since 30 June 
2018. 
 
•  Worst Offenders: Ostrum AM undertakes to exclude from its investments any equities or bonds of private 
companies that have committed proven and serious infringements of a set of core standards of responsibility. 
As such, we exclude all listed and unlisted companies that fail to comply with the principles of the UN Global 
Compact and/or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
 
II.  ESG FACTORS INCORPORATED INTO CLOSE TO 100% OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT 
 
We have decided to systematically integrate the ESG criteria (in almost all of our management) when we believe 
that they will add value to our financial analysis. We are convinced that material non-financial elements provide 
additional information that may influence the risk profile of issuers. 
Ostrum AM has decided to implement ESG integration throughout its investment processes because we are 
convinced that some non-financial elements influence the risk profile of issuers. 
These elements are thus considered "material" because they have an impact in terms of the risk or performance 
of the securities held in portfolios. Considering such ESG criteria is therefore relevant to all investment processes. 
These elements must be taken into account in the fundamental analysis and risk assessment of issuers. 
Integrating material non-financial elements into almost all investment processes has enabled Ostrum AM to obtain 
excellent PRI scores (A/A+ scores for all asset classes under management). 
 
ESG IN FIXED INCOME 
 
We incorporate ESG criteria into all our main bond investment processes by reviewing relevant ESG criteria as 
part of our fundamental issuer analysis. 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
21 
 
1.  AS REGARDS CREDIT ISSUERS 
 
The ESG incorporation process is based on our belief that material ESG factors, just like any other material factor, 
can have an impact on an issuer's credit risk and accordingly influence its fundamental rating. 
 
An ESG factor is considered "material" when it has a positive or negative impact on the credit risk profile of an 
issuer in addition to being reasonably likely to occur over the investment horizon (which is close to three years, 
just like our fundamental ratings). 
 
Our approach is a qualitative one. It is based on the in-depth knowledge of our credit analysts: they are best 
placed to assess the material factors impacting issuer credit risk in the sectors in which they have expertise. 
 
Governance is systematically reviewed and incorporated into the "Management, Strategy and Governance" 
section of our analysis reports. Social and Environmental factors are considered at each stage, namely in terms 
of industry, business model and financial analysis, and are thus included in the credit analysis score. 
 
NB: Within our investment universe, one third of "avoid" issuers are there for governance reasons. This shows 
our belief regarding the crucial role of ESG criteria in assessing a company's future risk profile. 
 
The credit incorporation process is a combination of an "issuer-by-issuer" approach and a sector-based approach: 
 
•  "Issuer-by-issuer" approach 
 
The  analyst's  judgement  is  key:  reviewing  all  non-financial  inputs  is  essential  in  order  to  assess  the 
strength/weakness of a specific issuer with respect to an identified ESG factor. 
In order to incorporate ESG criteria in a uniform manner, we developed risk/opportunity categorisation for each 
pillar (E/S/G). Analysts must thus keep this categorisation in mind and incorporate it into their assessment of 
issuer credit risk. 
For example, we identified that material environmental issues are typically linked to two risks: environmental 
"accidents" (man-made environmental disasters), or alternatively "transition" risks stemming from changes in the 
regulatory  framework  aimed  at  reducing  environmental  risks.  A  typical  transition  risk  for  automotive 
manufacturers, for example, stems from new air quality regulations (CO2 emission regulations in Europe, nitrogen 
oxide emissions in the United States, and fuel consumption in China). It means additional R&D expenditure, 
additional costs from new components, possible fines, etc. 
 
•  "Sector-based" approach 
 
We regularly organise ESG workshops with credit analysts that identify the material key ESG factors potentially 
impacting a particular sector (and hence our ratings). These factors are documented and allow material risks to 
be mapped. 
Anticipating future ESG risks is a key part of our approach, given that we also invest for the long term and are 
interested in the futures of the companies we finance. In certain instances, we know that certain ESG risks are 
not necessarily material in the short term but will be so over the next 10 years (such as those resulting from 
climate change). 
That is why we have identified specific ESG issues that are not material now or in the medium term, but will be 
so over the long term. We are therefore monitoring them from now on. We believe that this is a key differentiator 
in our proprietary credit research. 
 
The output of our sector risk mapping consists of eight "one-pagers" summarising the key risks/opportunities: 
1.  Media – Telecommunications – Technology – Leisure 
2.  Pharmaceutical & Health 
3.  Consumer Goods & Retail 
4.  Basic Industries (Metal & Mining, Chemicals, Paper/Packaging) 
5.  Automotive & Transport 
6.  Capital  Goods  (Diversified  Manufacturing  Industries,  Aerospace  &  Defence,  Construction 
Machinery, Construction Materials) 
7.  Utilities – Energy – Oil & Gas 
8.  Financial (Banking – Insurance – Real Estate) 
 
We measure ESG risk intensity based on the relevance of ESG elements to the industry or company itself. If 
these ESG elements are relevant, we measure their impact on the company's risk profile. 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
22 
 
We classify ESG impact using a scale outlined below: 
•  ESG0: ESG elements "not relevant" to the industry or company 
•  ESG1: ESG elements "relevant" to the industry or company, low impact on the company's credit 
risk 
•  ESG2: ESG elements "relevant" to the industry or company, limited direct impact, or while ESG 
risks/opportunities are significant, the company is managing them well, so the impact on credit risk

a.  Sovereign Risk Assessment Model 
 
A proprietary valuation model, offering medium-term forecasts over one to two years and updated every three 
months if necessary, was recently developed by our team of quantitative engineers. This model allows possible 
changes in the risk assessment for both developed and emerging countries to be identified using an internal rating 
scale. 
The changes predicted in the risk assessment are monitored for each country (+/- rating category). This innovative 
machine learning model is another source of information for managers and is used to construct sovereign 
portfolios, and is thus central to the investment process. This model is based on the following elements: 
 
•  Economy:  internal  vulnerability  variables  (such  as  the  unemployment  rate)  and  external 
vulnerability variables (such as the primary balance). Source: Standard & Poor's 
 
•  Material non-financial information: ESG variables such as anti-corruption monitoring, political 
stability, CO2 emissions, etc. Sources: World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme. 
 
b.  Sovereign Debt Selection (SDS) Sector Team 
 
Our sovereign investment experts take a historical view of ESG factors and of their impact on the risk assessment 
of eurozone countries. 
 
The SDS team produces bottom-up views on the relative value of government bonds for each country in the 
eurozone. The objective is to identify those sovereign debts to which the managers wish to be exposed over a 
defined investment horizon. 
 
SDS members analyse both performance factors (opinions on spreads and flows) and risk factors (financial risks, 
such as macroeconomic and regulatory, as well as non-financial factors). 
 
In this sense, our teams assess each strand of ESG by country: 
•   The Environment strand is assessed against: trends in CO2 emissions per capita (World Bank 
source), energy intensity (World Bank) and a country's vulnerability to climate change and its ability to adapt 
to it (ND-Gain Index). 
•  The Social pillar is assessed by looking at the Human Development Index adjusted for inequality 
(United Nations Development Programme) 
•   Governance is assessed by the World Bank's World Governance Indicators (WGI): Political 
Stability, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, Voice and Accountability, and Control 
of Corruption. 
 
Some variables similar to those of the sovereign risk model are therefore reviewed by the SDS team. Thanks to 
the various discussions that take place within the SDS sector team (the deadline for downgrading a country's 
assessment, for example), they are complemented by the analyses and interpretations of the management teams 
and are reviewed in respect of the investment horizon. As a result, by combining the financial and non-financial 
elements, the Sovereign Debt Selection Team produces opinions on the sovereign debts of the eurozone on the 
basis of their maturity terms (1-3; 3-7; 7-15; 15+ years) with a rating (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2). 
 
Finally, in our emerging-debt investment process, portfolio managers historically consider and integrate material 
non-financial elements into their risk assessments for each emerging-market country (in addition to financial 
elements).

III.  Voting and engagement 
 
Ostrum AM encourages its portfolio companies to improve their practices by participating in general meetings 
and engaging in constructive dialogue with the companies. 
 
It has two major levers to bring about this positive change: 
 
-  The exercise of shareholder voting rights at general meetings for all investments, in line with our active 
policy and the highest standards and taking into account social and environmental issues. Motivated by 
a desire to improve the transparency of its efforts as a shareholder, Ostrum AM has developed a platform 
that aggregates all its votes by company and by fund. 
 
 
-  A process of engagement that involves long-term dialogue with the companies in which it invests to get 
a better understanding of their practices and support the adoption of higher ESG standards. 
 
Our internal research model, built around in-depth knowledge and ongoing dialogue with the portfolio companies, 
simultaneously incorporates ESG factors within the financial analysis (proprietary tools for assessing quality and 
growth), the assessment of ESG risk (internal analysis model), valuation (proprietary tool) and the exercise of 
voting rights (Ostrum voting policy and internal governance analysis). 
 
IV.  CO2 and energy transition 
 
Carbon strategies materialise first and foremost by the CO2 valuation of portfolios. At Ostrum AM, we make 
available to our eligible customers, through our annual "LTE" reporting, the carbon footprint of the portfolio in 
which they are invested. In addition, in line with its parent company Natixis, and in the context of its work to 
promote the energy transition, Ostrum AM excludes from its investment universe companies that are heavily 
invested in the production and mining of coal or companies that use so-called "mountaintop removal" coal 
extraction methods. 
 
Companies with a significant impact on the climate are subject to particular scrutiny: energy producers, carbon-
intensive sectors (heavy industry, construction and transport) and suppliers of low-carbon devices and solutions.

■  Remuneration policy 
 
INVESTMENT MANAGERS INTERNATIONAL (NIMI) remuneration policy 
 
This NIMI remuneration policy consists of general principles applicable to all employees (see point I), specific 
principles applicable to employees identified by AIFM and UCITS V (see point II), and a governance mechanism 
applicable to all employees (see point III). 
 
It falls within the framework of the remuneration policy defined by Natixis and is established in compliance with 
the provisions relating to the remuneration stipulated in the following regulatory texts, as well as the guidelines 
of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the positions of the Autorité des Marchés 
Financiers (AMF) (French Financial Markets Authority) resulting therefrom: 
 
•   Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative 
Investment Fund Managers, transposed into the Monetary and Financial Code by Order No. 2013-676 
of 27 July 2013 ("AIFM Directive"). 
 
•   Directive 2014/91/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on undertakings 
for collective investment in transferable securities, transposed into the Monetary and Financial Code 
by Order No. 2016-312 of 17 March 2016 ("UCITS V Directive"). 
 
•   Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in 
financial instruments, transposed into the Monetary and Financial Code by Order No. 2016-827 of 
23 June 2016, supplemented by the Delegated Regulation 2017/565/EU of 25 April 2016 ("MIFII 
Directive"). 
 
1.  General principles of the remuneration policy 
 
The remuneration policy is a strategic aspect of the NIMI policy. As a tool to enhance employee motivation and 
commitment, it aims to be competitive and attractive in relation to the rest of the industry while fully complying 
with key financial indicators and regulations. 
 
The NIMI remuneration policy, which applies to all employees, incorporates the alignment of the interests of its 
employees with those of investors into its fundamental principles: 
 
•   It is consistent and promotes sound and efficient risk management and does not encourage risk-
taking, which would be incompatible with the risk profiles, regulations or documents constituting the 
products managed. 
 
•   It is in line with the economic strategy, objectives, values and interests of the Management Company 
and the products it manages, as well as those of investors, and includes measures aimed at preventing 
conflicts of interest. 
 
The remuneration policy covers all components of remuneration, which include fixed remuneration and, where 
applicable, variable remuneration. 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
27 
 
Fixed remuneration rewards skills, professional experience and level of responsibility. It takes into account market 
conditions. 
 
Variable remuneration depends on assessment of collective performance — measured for the Management 
Company and the products managed — and individual performance. It considers quantitative and qualitative 
elements, which can be established on an annual or multi-year basis. 
 
a.  Definition of performance 
 
The objective and transparent assessment of annual and multi-year performance based on predefined objectives 
is a prerequisite for applying the NIMI remuneration policy. It ensures the fair and selective treatment of 
employees. This assessment is shared between the employee and their manager during an individual appraisal 
interview. The contribution and performance level of each employee are assessed with regard to their duties, 
assignments and level of responsibility in the Management Company. In this context, the remuneration policy 
distinguishes several categories of staff: 
 
•   The Management Committee is assessed on its contribution to the definition and implementation of the 
Management Company's strategy, this strategy being part of that of the international distribution platform 
and that of Dynamic Solutions. The Management Committee is also assessed on its ability to expand 
the performance of product and service offerings, on the performance of the distribution activity and, 
more generally, on the development of the group's multi-boutique model, as well as on the risk-adjusted 
financial performance within its scope of supervision. For this category, performance is assessed 
annually through quantitative indicators linked to changes in NIMI's financial results and supervised 
activities, as well as a contribution to the overall performance of Natixis IM. Performance is also 
assessed through the achievement of qualitative objectives, such as the quality of management and/or 
responsibility for/contribution to cross-functional projects. 
 
•   Support functions are assessed on their ability to proactively support the strategic challenges of the 
Management Company. Individual performance is assessed annually through the achievement of 
qualitative objectives, such as the quality of recurring activity and the degree of participation in cross-
functional projects or strategic/regulatory plans. These objectives are defined annually in accordance 
with those of NIMI, those of the international distribution platform and, where applicable, those of 
Dynamic Solutions. 
 
•   Assessment of the performance of control functions is based on the evaluation of qualitative criteria only, 
such as participation in cross-functional projects or in strategic/regulatory plans, defined annually, to 
avoid compromising their independence or creating conflicts of interest with the activities they control. 
 
•   The performance of management functions is assessed according to a quantitative criterion linked to 
the generation of value through allocation, supplemented by one or more qualitative criteria. This 
quantitative criterion reflects the development issues of the management performance sought by 
investors without causing excessive risk-taking, which may have an impact on the risk profile of NIMI 
and the products managed. This quantitative criterion is calculated over a predefined period in line with 
the risk-adjusted performance horizon of the funds managed and of the Management Company. 
 
•   The  assessment  of  the  performance  of  the  distribution  functions  is  based  on  the evaluation of 
quantitative and qualitative criteria. The quantitative criteria are based on gross inflows, net inflows, 
turnover,  the  profitability  of  outstandings  and  their  changes.  The  qualitative  criteria  include  the 
diversification and development of the business (new clients, new affiliates, new expertise, etc.) and the 
joint consideration of the interests of NIMI and those of clients. 
 
The performance assessment incorporates, for all categories of staff, qualitative criteria. These qualitative criteria 
always include compliance with regulations and internal procedures in terms of risk management and NIMI 
compliance. 
 
They may also relate to the quality of the relationship with clients, including the level of expertise and advice 
provided, the contribution to the reliability of a process, the participation in a cross-functional project, the 
contribution to the development of new expertise, participation in the development of operational efficiency or any 
other subjects defined as a variation of NIMI's strategic objectives. 
 
For every category of staff, all quantitative and qualitative objectives are defined and communicated individually 
at the start of the year, in line with NIMI's strategic objectives.

b.  Components of remuneration 
 
i.  Fixed remuneration 
 
NIMI strives to maintain a level of fixed remuneration that is sufficient to compensate the professional activity of 
employees. 
 
Fixed remuneration rewards the skills, professional experience and level of responsibility expected of an 
employee in performing their duties. 
 
The  positioning  of  fixed  remuneration  is  reviewed  periodically  to  ensure  its  consistency  with  regard  to 
geographical and professional market practices. 
 
The revaluation of fixed salaries is analysed once a year as part of the annual remuneration review. Outside these 
periods, only cases of promotion, professional mobility or exceptional individual situations can give rise to a 
revaluation. 
 
ii.  Variable remuneration 
 
Variable remuneration packages are defined based on NIMI's annual results, the international distribution 
platform, dynamic solutions and qualitative elements, such as the practices of competitors, the general market 
conditions under which the results were obtained and factors that may have temporarily affected the performance 
of the business. 
 
Variable remuneration, which can be allocated, if necessary, compensates individual annual performance as part 
of collective performance. 
 
NIMI's collective variable remuneration consists of a profit-sharing and incentive scheme, associated with a 
company savings plan (PEE) and a company collective retirement savings plan (PERCO). Employees can benefit 
from a matching scheme under these plans. 
 
This collective variable remuneration has no incentive effect on the management of NIMI's risks and the products 
managed and is beyond the scope of application of the AIFM or UCITS V Directives. 
 
In accordance with the global variable remuneration envelopes, individual variable remuneration is allocated, as 
part of the annual remuneration review, in an objective discretionary manner with regard to the assessment of 
individual performance and the manner in which that performance is achieved. Variable remuneration awarded 
to employees is affected by inappropriate risk and compliance management or non-compliance with regulations 
and internal procedures over the year considered (see I-1. above). 
 
The identified employees are subject to specific obligations in terms of adherence to the rules on risks and 
compliance. A breach of these obligations may result in the partial reduction or removal of the individual variable 
remuneration awarded. 
 
In the event of a significant loss or decline in its results, NIMI can also decide to reduce or entirely cancel the 
amounts allocated to individual variable remuneration, as well as, if applicable, any maturities in the process of 
being acquired by way of variable remuneration that have already been awarded and deferred. 
 
There are no contractual guarantees for variable remuneration, with the occasional exception of variable 
remuneration awarded for the first year of work as part of external recruitment. 
 
"Golden parachute" agreements are forbidden. Payments related to the early termination of an employment 
contract are defined in accordance with legal provisions (legal and contractual indemnities) and the performance 
of the beneficiary, their membership activity and the performance of the entire Management Company over the 
period; they are designed to avoid rewarding failure. 
 
Variable remuneration is not paid through instruments or methods that facilitate circumvention of the requirements 
established in the regulations. 
 
iii.  Key employee retention scheme 
 
NIMI wants to ensure that its investors have confidence in the stability of its teams. 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
29 
 
 
To achieve this, a system of deferred remuneration has been built into its remuneration policies. 
 
Beyond a certain variable threshold, this scheme leads to the allocation of a proportion of  the variable 
remuneration in the form of a cash payment indexed to the evolution of the consolidated financial performance of 
Natixis IM measured by its earnings before tax (EBT), recorded each year for a period of at least three years. The 
proportion of variable remuneration thus deferred is vested in equal tranches for a period of at least three years 
and links employees to the performance of Natixis IM. The deferred variable remuneration rate results from the 
application of a table of deferred amounts. 
 
This scheme is subject to conditions involving the presence and absence of behaviour outside the norm that may 
have an impact on NIMI's level of risk. Vesting of these tranches may be subject to a repayment commitment, in 
full or in part, to ensure ex-post risk adjustment. 
 
iv.  Balance between fixed and variable remuneration 
 
NIMI ensures that there is an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable components of the total 
remuneration received and that the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total 
remuneration so that a fully flexible policy can be exercised with regard to variable components of remuneration, 
including the possibility of paying no variable component. All individual situations, for which variable remuneration 
represents fixed remuneration more than once and which can be explained by market practice or an exceptional 
level of responsibility, performance and behaviour, are documented by the Human Resources Department as part 
of the annual remuneration review. 
 
2.  Breakdown of the system applicable to the population identified as AIFM or UCITS V 
 
a.  Identified population 
 
In accordance with regulatory provisions, the identified employees of NIMI consists of the categories of staff that 
include general management, risk-takers and persons exercising a control function, as well as any employee 
who, in view of their total remuneration, is located in the same remuneration bracket as general management and 
risk-takers, whose professional activities have a significant impact on the risk profile of the Management Company 
and the products managed by it. These persons are identified according to their professional activity, their level 
of responsibility or their level of total remuneration. 
 
To maintain consistency and alignment, NIMI has decided to implement the system applicable to identified 
employees across the full scope of products managed (mandates, UCITS and AIFs). 
 
The following employee categories are identified: 
 
•  Members of the management body 
 
•  Staff members responsible for portfolio management 
 
•  Managers of control functions (risks, compliance and internal control) 
 
•  Those responsible for support or administrative activities 
 
•  Other risk-takers 
 
•  Employees who, in view of their total remuneration, are in the same remuneration bracket as general 
management and risk-takers. 
 
Each year, before the annual remuneration review, the Human Resources Department determines and formalises 
the identification methodology and scope of the identified employees of NIMI, in conjunction with the Internal 
Control Officer. 
 
The scope of all the identified employees is then validated by NIMI's General Management team, then presented 
to the Natixis Remuneration Committee. 
 
The entire identification process is documented and archived by the Human Resources Department. The 
employees concerned are also informed of their status. 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
30 
 
b.  System applicable to variable remuneration allocated to the identified population 
 
In accordance with regulations and to ensure alignment between employees and investors and the Management 
Company, the variable remuneration of identified employees, as soon as it exceeds a certain threshold, is partly 
deferred and partly awarded in the form of a financial instrument over a period of at least three years, acquired 
pro rata temporis. 
 
The proportion of variable remuneration, which is deferred over three years, increases with the amount of variable 
remuneration awarded and can reach 60% for the highest NIMI remunerations. Currently, application methods 
for the deferred payment are as follows: 
 
•  Between €200,000 and €499,000: 50% deferred 
 
•  From €500,000: 60% deferred 
 
The thresholds for triggering deferred variable remuneration are subject to change depending on regulations or 
changes in internal policies. In this case, the new thresholds defined are subject to the approval of the NIMI 
General Management Committee and the Natixis Remuneration Committee. 
 
Up to 50% of variable remuneration is also allocated in financial instruments in the form of indexed cash payments: 
 
•   For teams participating directly in portfolio management, on the performance of a portfolio of products 
managed by NIMI 
 
•   For teams that are not directly involved in portfolio management, on the evolution of the consolidated 
financial performance of Natixis IM measured by its earnings before tax (EBT), recorded each year over a 
period of at least three years 
 
The vesting of the variable remuneration proportion, which is deferred, is subject to conditions involving 
attendance and the consolidated financial performance of Natixis IM and the absence of behaviour out of the 
norm that may have an impact on the level of risk of NIMI or managed products. 
 
This vesting is also subject to obligations in terms of adherence to the rules on risks and compliance. Failure to 
comply with these obligations can result in a partial or total decrease in the vesting. It can also be subject to a full 
or partial repayment commitment to ensure ex-post risk adjustment. 
 
Employees benefiting from deferred variable remuneration are prohibited from using individual hedging or 
insurance strategies over the entire vesting period. 
 
The terms and conditions for the determination, valuation, allocation, acquisition and payment of deferred variable 
remuneration in an equivalent financial instrument are detailed in the Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) of NIMI 
and Natixis IM. 
 
3.  Governance 
 
The general and specific principles of the remuneration policy are defined and formalised by the Human 
Resources Department of NIMI in line with the policy applicable within the international distribution platform. 
 
The Internal Control Department and the Risk Department of NIMI have an active role in the development, 
continuous monitoring and evaluation of the remuneration policy. They are thus involved in determining the overall 
strategy applicable to the Management Company to promote the development of effective risk management. As 
such, they are involved in determining the scope of identified employees. They are also responsible for assessing 
the impact of the variable remuneration structure on the risk profile of managers. 
 
The NIMI remuneration policy is approved by the NIMI Board of Directors. 
 
The general and specific principles, the rules of application and figures summarising the remuneration policy, 
including the identified employees, are approved successively by the members of the NIMI Management 
Committee, the General Management of Natixis IM and the General Management of Natixis. 
 
NIMI, which does not have a Remuneration Committee but belongs to the Natixis Group, reports to the Natixis 
Remuneration Committee. 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
31 
 
The Natixis Remuneration Committee was established and acts in accordance with regulations: 
 
•   Both in its composition: independence and expertise of its members 
 
•   And in the exercise of its duties, which in management companies more specifically includes the following 
roles: 
 
o    Advice and assistance to the Board of Directors for the development and implementation of the 
Management Company's remuneration policy 
 
o    Assistance to the Board of Directors in overseeing the development and operation of the Management 
Company's remuneration system 
 
o    Particular attention is paid to the assessment of the mechanisms adopted to ensure that the 
remuneration  system  considers  all  the  categories  of  risks,  liquidity  and  levels  of  assets  under 
management in an appropriate manner and to ensure compatibility of the remuneration policy with the 
economic strategy, objectives, values and interests of the Management Company and the products 
managed, as well as with those of investors. 
 
In this context, the general and specific principles, compliance of NIMI's remuneration policy with applicable 
regulations, application methods and summary figures of its remuneration policy, including the identified 
population and the highest remuneration, are submitted to the Natixis Remuneration Committee for review, 
then approved by its Board of Directors. 
 
The remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer of NIMI is determined by the General Management of 
Natixis IM and Natixis, then presented to the Remuneration Committee of Natixis before being approved 
by the Board of Directors of Natixis. 
 
The  remuneration  of  NIMI's  Risk  and  Compliance  Directors  is  reviewed,  within  the  framework  of 
independent reviews performed by the risk and compliance departments, by the Risk and Compliance 
Directors of Natixis IM. They are then submitted to the Natixis Remuneration Committee. 
 
The general and specific principles of the remuneration policy are communicated internally to all employees 
and members of the Works Council. 
 
This entire review, validation and communication process takes place every year. It includes any regulatory 
and contextual changes and is consistent with the remuneration policy of Natixis. 
 
Finally, the entire NIMI remuneration policy is subject to an annual centralised and independent review by 
the Internal Audit Department of Natixis IM. 
 
When NIMI delegates the financial management of one of the portfolios for which it is the Management 
Company to another management company, it ensures that the delegated company complies with the 
regulations in force.

OSTRUM ASSET MANAGEMENT remuneration policy 
 
This OSTRUM AM remuneration policy consists of (i) general principles applicable to all employees defined in 
point 1, (ii) specific principles applicable to employees regulated by AIFM and UCITS V defined in point 2 and (iii) 
a governance mechanism applicable to all employees defined in point 3. 
It falls within the principles defined by Natixis. 
 
1. General principles of the remuneration policy 
 
The remuneration policy is a strategic aspect of OSTRUM AM's policy. As a tool to enhance employee motivation 
and commitment, it aims to be competitive and attractive in relation to the rest of the industry while fully complying 
with key financial indicators and regulations. It is defined in such a way as to avoid generating situations that are 
likely to create conflicts of interest between OSTRUM AM's employees and customers. 
 
The policy covers all components of remuneration. It distinguishes between fixed remuneration based on an 
evaluation of the skills required for the post and determined using market rates, and variable remuneration based 
on an evaluation of defined individual or collective performance criteria. 
 
This performance assessment is based on quantitative and qualitative annual and multi-year performance criteria. 
Its fundamental principles incorporate the alignment of the interests of investors, employees and OSTRUM AM. 
It applies to all OSTRUM AM staff. 
 
The remuneration policy is reviewed and approved each year to incorporate any regulatory and contextual 
changes, in line with the Natixis remuneration policy. As part of the monitoring and evaluation of the remuneration 
policy, the Compliance and Internal Control Officer at OSTRUM AM approves the policy prior to its deployment. 
It is subject to an annual internal audit. 
 
A report on the general principles of the remuneration policy is prepared annually for the members of the Works 
Council, the Board of Directors and all staff. 
 
a.    Definition of performance 
 
The objective and transparent assessment of annual and multi-year performance is a prerequisite for applying 
OSTRUM AM's remuneration policy. It ensures fair and selective treatment of the company's employees. This 
assessment is shared between the employee and their manager during an individual appraisal interview. 
 
Each employee's contribution and performance are assessed in accordance with their duties, tasks and level of 
responsibility in the company. In this context, the remuneration policy distinguishes several categories of staff: 
 
-  The executive committee is evaluated on its contribution to the definition and implementation of the 
company's strategy and on its ability to increase performance in terms of product and service offerings 
and financial results. For this category, performance is assessed annually based on the performance of 
activities supervised through quantitative indicators, changes in OSTRUM AM's financial results and 
supervised activities, as well as a contribution to overall performance, reflected by the achievement of 
qualitative objectives such as managerial objectives or in terms of responsibility/contribution to cross-
functional projects. 
 
-  Support functions are appraised on the basis of their contribution to furthering the company's strategic 
goals. Individual performance is reflected annually by achievement of qualitative objectives such as the 
quality of recurring business activity or participation in cross-functional projects or strategic/regulatory 
plans. These objectives are defined and communicated at the start of each year in the form of OSTRUM 
AM's strategic objectives. 
 
-  Assessment of the performance of the control functions is based on the evaluation of qualitative criteria 
only, such as participation in cross-functional projects or strategic/regulatory plans, defined annually, in 
order not to compromise their independence or create conflicts of interest. 
 
-  The performance of management functions is assessed on the basis of two quantitative criteria: the 
information ratio or Sharpe ratio (for absolute return portfolios) and competitive ranking, together with 
one or more qualitative criteria. 
 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
33 
 
Quantitative criteria reflect the development issues of the management performance sought by investors 
without causing excessive risk-taking, which may have an impact on the risk profile of OSTRUM AM and 
the products managed. 
These quantitative criteria are calculated over a period of one year and three years to demonstrate the 
company's performance over time and to limit the impact of a one-off performance. 
 
Performance evaluation always incorporates qualitative criteria. These include improving the reliability of a 
process, participating in a cross-disciplinary project, contributing to the development of new expertise, contributing 
to the development of operational efficiencies or any other aspects defined by the strategic objectives set out by 
OSTRUM AM. 
 
These qualitative objectives are defined and communicated at the start of each year. 
 
These qualitative criteria also incorporate compliance with OSTRUM AM's risk and compliance rules. 
 
b.  Component of remuneration 
 
i. Fixed remuneration 
 
OSTRUM AM endeavours to maintain a fixed level of  remuneration sufficient to remunerate employees' 
professional activities, in order to guarantee a balanced proportion between fixed and variable remuneration. 
 
Fixed remuneration reflects the skills and expertise expected of an employee in performing their duties. 
 
The  positioning  of  fixed  remuneration  is  reviewed  periodically  to  ensure  its  consistency  with  regard  to 
geographical and professional market practices. 
Revaluations of fixed salaries and the allocation of variable remuneration are analysed once a year as part of the 
annual remuneration review. Outside these periods, only cases of promotion, internal mobility or exceptional 
individual situations may give rise to a revaluation. 
 
ii. Variable remuneration 
 
Variable remuneration packages are defined on the basis of the annual results of OSTRUM AM as well as on the 
basis of qualitative analysis information, including the practices of competitors, the general market conditions in 
which the results were obtained, and factors that may have temporarily affected the performance of the business. 
 
Variable remuneration rewards annual collective or individual performance. 
 
The collective variable remuneration of OSTRUM AM consists of optional and mandatory employee profit-sharing 
schemes, associated with an employee savings plan (plan d'épargne salariale, or PES) and a collective retirement 
savings plan (plan d'épargne pour la retraite collectif, or PERCO), allowing employees to benefit from an employer 
matching contribution. 
 
This collective variable remuneration has no incentive effect on OSTRUM AM's risk management and/or the 
products managed and is not covered by the AIFM or UCITS V directives. 
 
Individual variable remuneration is awarded on a discretionary basis in light of an evaluation of individual 
performance and the manner in which objectives were achieved. The variable remuneration awarded to 
employees is affected by any non-compliant risk-taking or failure to comply with internal procedures during the 
year under review. 
 
Regulated employees and front-office employees are subject to specific obligations in terms of adherence to the 
rules on risks and compliance. A breach of these obligations may result in the partial reduction or removal of the 
individual variable remuneration awarded. 
 
In the event of a significant loss or decline in its results, OSTRUM AM may also decide that amounts allocated to 
individual remuneration and, where appropriate, payments in the process of being made, may not be distributed 
or may be reduced for one or more years. 
 
No contractual guarantee exists for variable remuneration, with the occasional exception of variable remuneration 
awarded after the first year in the job as part of recruitment from outside the company. 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
34 
 
Schemes such as "golden parachutes" are forbidden. Payments relating to the early termination of an employment 
contract are defined according to the legal provisions (legal and contractual indemnities) and the performance of 
the beneficiary, the area of the business to which they belong and the company as a whole. 
 
iii. Key employee retention scheme 
 
OSTRUM AM wants to ensure that its investors benefit from the continuity of service of its most talented 
employees, or those identified as key in terms of their commitment or contribution to results. 
 
To achieve this, a system of deferred remuneration has been built into its remuneration policies. 
 
This system enables an additional variable remuneration amount to be awarded in the form of cash indexed to 
the performance of an equally weighted portfolio of products managed by OSTRUM AM. It is vested in equal 
tranches over a minimum period of three years, thereby giving employees a vested interest in the performance 
of OSTRUM AM. It is subject to conditions of continued employment and the absence of conduct inconsistent 
with the company's standards, which may affect the level of risk of OSTRUM AM and/or the products managed. 
Vesting of these tranches may be subject to a repayment commitment so as to ensure ex-post risk adjustment. 
Amounts are awarded in light of performance evaluations and individual professional commitment over the year 
in question. 
 
2. Implementation of the scheme applicable to regulated employees 
 
a.     Identification of regulated employees 
 
In accordance with the regulatory provisions, the Human Resources Department (HRD) and the Compliance and 
Internal Control Officer determine and formalise the scope of OSTRUM AM's regulated employees at the 
beginning of the year. 
 
Employees are identified according to their professional activities when these involve financial management 
and/or employees who may have a significant individual impact on the risk profile of OSTRUM AM and/or the 
products managed due to their decisions, or due to their level of total remuneration. 
 
In order to maintain consistency and alignment, OSTRUM AM has decided to implement the system applicable 
to regulated employees across the full scope of products managed (mandates, UCITS and AIFs). 
 
Members of the Executive Committee are automatically included in the scope of regulated employees, as are 
management roles for administrative or support functions (financial and operations managers) and control 
management functions (risk, compliance and control managers). 
 
The scope of the regulated population is approved by general management and archived by the Human 
Resources Department. The employees concerned are notified of their status. 
 
The  scope  of  OSTRUM  AM's  regulated  employee  population  is  presented  to  the  Natixis  Remuneration 
Committee. 
 
The scope of the regulated population may be reviewed during the year in the event that an external candidate is 
recruited or there is an internal appointment, or when new activities or new management processes are launched. 
 
b.     Mechanism applicable to variable remuneration awarded to regulated employees 
 
The variable remuneration of regulated employees is subject to deferred terms, and awarded half in cash and 
half in the form of an equivalent financial instrument. 
 
The threshold for triggering deferred remuneration is set at €200,000 starting from 2018. It may be reviewed 
(downwards only) based on regulatory directives or changes to HR policies. In this case, the new threshold is 
approved by the Executive Committee of OSTRUM AM and the Natixis Remuneration Committee. For the highest 
levels of remuneration at OSTRUM AM, the deferred proportion in the form of an equivalent financial instrument 
may reach 60%. 
 
 
 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
35 
 
In  order  to  guarantee  alignment  between  employees  and  investors,  the  deferred  variable  remuneration 
component is granted in the form of cash indexed to the performance of a portfolio of products managed by 
OSTRUM AM. It vests after a minimum period of three annual deferral periods, subject to continued employment 
conditions and the absence of conduct inconsistent with the company's standards which may affect the level of 
risk of OSTRUM AM and/or the products managed. 
 
These vesting items are also subject to obligations in terms of adherence to the rules on risks and compliance. 
Breach of these obligations may result in the reduction or rescindment of said items. They may also be subject to 
a repayment commitment so as to ensure risk adjustment ex post. 
Employees awarded deferred variable remuneration are prohibited from using individual hedging or insurance 
strategies for the entire vesting period. 
 
3. Governance 
 
The general and specific principles of the remuneration policy are defined and documented by the Human 
Resources Department and then submitted for validation by the OSTRUM AM Compliance and Internal Control 
Officer. 
 
They are validated and approved in turn by members of the Executive Committee of OSTRUM AM and the general 
management of Natixis IM and Natixis. 
 
The general and specific principles of the remuneration policy are communicated in-house to all employees by 
HR announcements, including via the Intranet, and to members of the Works Council through an annual 
information meeting. 
 
The general and specific principles, the application methods and quantified summary data of the remuneration 
policy including the regulated employees, as well as the annual remuneration package for executives, are 
provided annually to the Board of Directors of OSTRUM AM. 
 
The Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is determined by the general management of Natixis IM and Natixis 
and is submitted to the NATIXIS Remuneration Committee for approval by the Board of Directors of Natixis. 
 
When OSTRUM AM delegates the financial management of one of the portfolios for which it is the Management 
Company to another management company, it ensures that the said delegated company complies with the 
regulations in force.

IV - FEES AND TAXATION 
 
■  Retrocession of management fees 
 
In accordance with portfolio management best practice, the provisions of Article 411-130 of the AMF General 
Regulations prohibit the restitution to the delegated Management Company of any management fees or 
subscription and redemption fees in respect of investments made by it on behalf of the SICAV in units or shares 
of UCIs or investment funds. 
The Management Company has implemented the necessary measures to ensure that all such fees are paid 
directly to the SICAV.

■  Proposed allocation of distributable income 
 
We request that you approve the annual financial statements (balance sheet, off-balance sheet items, income

of €5,450,532.49. 
 
We propose the following distributions and allocations of distributable income: 
 
 
 
SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO – Board of Directors' Report – Period end 31/03/2020 
37 
 
I – Distributable income relating to profit 
 
The distributable income relating to profit amounts to €5,450,532.49 plus the retained earnings of €1,171.63, i.e. 
an amount to be allocated of €5,451,704.12. 
 
It is proposed to allocate them as follows: 
 
R(C) shares 
 
The amount to be allocated in respect of the portion relating to income is €1,554,630.69. 
It is proposed that this sum be allocated to the capital account in accordance with statutory provisions. 
 
It is noted that distributable income related to profit was accumulated in full during the previous three financial 
years. 
 
R(D) shares 
 
The amount to be allocated in respect of the portion relating to income is €357,010.25. 
 
It is proposed that this amount be allocated as follows: 
  to shareholders in the form of dividends:  €355,982.20 
  retained earnings  €1,028.05. 
It is proposed that a net dividend of €2.72 per R(D) share be paid. 
 
This dividend is composed of income from French bonds of €0.5 and from European bonds of €2.22. For 
shareholders who are natural persons domiciled in France, this income is subject to compulsory non-definitive 
withholding tax of 12.8%, pursuant to the provisions scheduled in Article 125 A IIIa of the French General Tax 
Code. This withholding tax may be offset against the income tax owed for the year in which it applies. In fact, this 
income is ultimately subject to a single lump-sum deduction from gross income at a fixed rate of 12.8%, or, at the 
taxpayer's explicit, irrevocable and comprehensive choice, to income tax according to the progressive schedule 
(Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code). Income is also subject to social security deductions at the rate 
of 17.2%. 
 
It is proposed to the General Meeting that the dividend, which does not entitle tax residents in France to any tax 
credits, be generated on 20 July 2020 and paid on 22 July 2020. 
 
It is noted that the net dividends paid in respect of previous financial years were as follows: 
 
Financial year  Net dividend 
2018-2019  €3.52 
2017-2018  €4.50 
2016-2017  €5.84 
 
I(C) shares

OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO: ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 31/03/2020 
 
 
NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
1. ACCOUNTING RULES AND METHODS 
 
The annual financial statements are presented in the form prescribed by ANC Regulation no. 2014-01, as 
amended. 
 
The following general accounting principles apply: 
- A true and fair view, comparability and going concern; 
- Lawfulness and fairness; 
- Prudence; 
- Consistency in accounting methods from one financial year to the next. 
 
Income from fixed-income securities is recorded using the accrued interest method. 
 
Purchases and sales of securities are recorded exclusive of fees. 
The reference currency of the portfolio is the euro. 
The length of the financial year is 12 months. 
 
INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS 
The financial statements were prepared by the Management Company based on the information available in light 
of the evolving Covid-19 crisis. 
 
Asset valuation rules 
 
Financial instruments are recorded using the historical cost method and entered in the balance sheet at their 
current value, i.e. at their last known market value or, where there is no market, via any external methods or using 
financial modelling. 
Differences between the current values used to calculate the net asset value and the historical costs of 
transferable securities when these were first included in the portfolio are recorded in the accounts as "valuation 
differences". 
Securities denominated in currencies other than the portfolio's reference currency are valued in accordance with 
the principle outlined below and then converted into the portfolio's reference currency at the exchange rate on the 
valuation date. 
 
Deposits: 
 
Deposits with a residual life of three months or less are valued on a straight-line basis. 
 
Equities, bonds and other securities traded on a regulated or equivalent market: 
 
To calculate the net asset value, equities and other securities traded on a regulated or equivalent market are 
valued based on the final stock market price of the day. 
Bonds and equivalent securities are valued on the basis of an average of contributed prices obtained daily from 
market makers. Interest accrued on bonds and equivalent securities is calculated up to the net asset value date. 
 
Equities, bonds and other securities not traded on a regulated or equivalent market: 
 
Securities not traded on a regulated market are valued under the responsibility of the Board of Directors using 
methods based on market value and yield, taking into account prices used for recent significant transactions. 
 
Negotiable debt securities: 
 
Negotiable debt securities and equivalent securities that are not traded in large volumes are valued using an 
actuarial method based on a reference rate defined below, plus, where applicable, a differential that is 
representative of the intrinsic characteristics of the issuer. 
Negotiable debt securities maturing in one year or less: Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor); 
Negotiable debt securities maturing in more than one year: Rates for French treasury bills (BTANs) or French 
treasury bonds (OATs) with similar maturity dates for the longest durations. 
 
Negotiable debt securities with a residual life of three months or less may be valued on a straight-line basis. 
 
French Treasury Bills are valued based on the market rate published daily by the Banque de France. 
 
 
 
 
 
OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO: ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 31/03/2020 
 
 
UCIs held: 
 
UCI units or shares will be valued at the last known net asset value. 
 
Temporary securities transactions: 
 
Securities received under repurchase agreements are recorded as assets under the heading of "Receivables 
representing securities received under repurchase agreements" at the amount indicated in the contract, plus any 
accrued interest receivable. 
 
Securities transferred under repurchase agreements are recognised in the long portfolio at their current value. 
Payables on securities transferred under repurchase agreements are recognised in the short portfolio at the 
contractual value plus any accrued interest payable. 
 
Loaned securities are valued at their current value and are recorded as assets at their current value, plus accrued 
interest receivable, under the "Receivables representing loaned securities" heading. 
 
Borrowed securities are recorded as assets under the "Borrowed securities" heading at the contracted amount, 
and as liabilities under the "Debts representing borrowed securities" heading at the amount indicated in the 
contract, plus any accrued interest payable. 
 
The guarantees received or sold in the form of cash in temporary securities transactions (loaned securities and 
repurchase agreements) are recognised as assets under "Liquid assets". 
 
Forward financial instruments: 
 
Forward financial instruments traded on a regulated or equivalent market: 
 
Forward financial instruments traded on regulated markets are valued on the basis of their closing prices. 
 
Forward financial instruments not traded on a regulated or equivalent market: 
 
Swaps: 
 
Interest rate and/or currency swaps are appraised at their market value based on a price calculated by discounting 
future interest flows at market interest rates and/or exchange rates. The resulting price is then adjusted for issuer 
risk. 
 
Index swaps are valued at their market value based on the fixing of the index as indicated in the prospectus. The 
prices are supplied by the counterparty under the supervision of the Management Company. 
 
Other swaps are valued at their market value or at a value estimated in accordance with the procedures 
determined by the Board of Directors. 
 
Off-balance sheet commitments: 
 
Futures contracts are recorded as off-balance sheet commitments at their market value based on the price used 
in the portfolio. 
Options are recognised at a value equivalent to that of their underlying assets. 
Swap commitments are recorded at their nominal value or, where there is no nominal value, at an equivalent 
amount. 
 
Swing pricing 
 
The Management Company has had a swing pricing system in place for the net asset value with a trigger threshold 
since 10 October 2016. This information is available to unitholders in the Fund's prospectus, available at the 
Management Company's registered office, and on its website. 
The health crisis resulted in severe volatility on the financial markets in the last few days of the last financial year 
and into the new financial year; liquidity has diminished sharply and volatility has surged considerably. In 
accordance with our swing pricing policy and in order to protect the Ostrum Sovereign Euro unitholders, we have 
been forced to adjust both our trigger thresholds and the margins on net asset values. This could be seen as 
volatility in net asset value; but it only appears that way, because an investor that remained invested over the 
period would not be affected at all. Indeed, these changes in net asset value apply only on the day when strong 
movements of liabilities impact the SICAV. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO: ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 31/03/2020 
 
 
Management fees 
 
Management fees are determined at each net asset value calculation. 
These fees are recorded in the income statement for the UCI. 
Management fees are paid in full to the Management Company responsible for all the UCIs' operating costs. 
Management fees do not include transaction fees. 
 
The rate applied on the basis of net assets is: 
- R(C) and R(D) shares: 0.70% incl. tax 
- I(C) shares: 0.45% incl. tax 
- N(D) shares: 0.50% incl. tax 
- N(C) shares: 0.50% incl. tax 
- UNICREDIT shares: 0.45% incl. tax 
- SN(C) shares: 0.36% incl. tax 
- SN(D) shares: 0.36% incl. tax 
 
The SICAV has paid the following fees calculated on the net assets excluding UCIs managed by Natixis Global 
Asset Management: 
- Under the deposit agreement: application of a fee schedule since 1 January 2008. 
- Under the delegation agreement. 
Since 1 January 2008, Natixis Asset Management has received a variable fee equal to the difference between 
the following pricing expressed as a percentage inclusive of tax of the management fees mentioned in the 
prospectus and the custodian fee: 
 
Allocation of distributable income 
 
Definition of distributable income: 
 
Distributable income consists of: 
 
Income: 
 
Net income for the financial year is equal to the amount of interest, arrears, premiums and bonuses, dividends, 
directors' fees and all other income generated by the securities held in the portfolio, plus income generated by 
temporary cash holdings, less management fees and borrowing costs. 
It is increased by the retained earnings and increased or reduced by the balance of the income adjustment 
account. 
 
Capital gains and losses: 
 
Realised capital gains, net of fees, minus realised capital losses, net of fees, recorded in the current financial 
year, plus net capital gains of the same type recognised in previous years that have not been distributed or

IV – EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT WORKING METHODS 
 
In accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-51.1 and R. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code, we 
confirm that the Board of Directors chose the procedure for general management at its meeting on 14 May 2002 
and opted to combine the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
During its meeting of 9 May 2012, when the Chairman's term of office was renewed, the Board of Directors opted 
to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. The separation of 
these functions was confirmed at its meeting of 27 September 2016. 
 
During its meeting held on 16 May 2018, the Board of Directors confirmed the general management structure of 
the SICAV and appointed Mr Ibrahima Kobar to the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors, for the term of his 
directorship, i.e. until the end of the Annual Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the accounts of the 
financial year ending in March 2024. 
 
In this same meeting, the Board of Directors appointed Mr Olivier de Larouzière to the position of Chief Executive 
Officer. His duties will end upon one of the following events, whichever occurs first: 
- the end of his term of office as the Chairman of the Board of Directors; 
- or the expiry of his contract of employment with the SICAV's delegated Management Company. No restrictions 
were placed on his powers by the Board of Directors. 
 
During its meeting held on 18 October 2018, the Board of Directors took note of the resignation of Mr Olivier de 
Larouzière from his duties as Chief Executive Officer of the SICAV. 
Upon learning of this resignation, the Board of Directors decided to change the general management method by 
resolving that general management of the SICAV will now be performed under the responsibility of the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors. 
 
Consequently, during the meeting, the Board of Directors decided to appoint Mr Ibrahima Kobar, Chairman of the 
Board of Directors, to serve as CEO of the SICAV as a replacement for Mr Olivier de Larouzière, the resigning 
party. Mr Ibrahima Kobar now serves as Chairman and CEO. 
 
Mr Ibrahima Kobar's term of office as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive office will expire at 
the earliest of the following two terms: 
- either the end of his directorship at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial 
statements for the financial year ended on the last Paris stock exchange trading day of March 2024, 
- or the expiry of his employment contract within one of the entities of the Natixis Investment Managers group.

SOUVERAINS EURO 
 
Financial year ended 31 
March 2020 
  To the General Meeting of the SICAV OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO, 
 
Opinion 
 
In execution of the assignment entrusted to us by your Board of Directors, we conducted the 
audit  of  the  Annual  Financial  Statements  of  the  undertaking  for  collective  investment 
OSTRUM SOUVERAINS EURO established in the form of an open-ended investment 
company with variable capital (SICAV) relating to the year ended 31 March 2020, as attached 
to this report. The financial statements were prepared by the Management Company based on 
the information available in light of the evolving Covid-19 crisis. 
 
We certify that the Annual Financial Statements are, in conformity with French accounting 
rules and principles, accurate and consistent and give a true and fair view of the financial 
performance for the previous financial year as well as the financial situation and assets of the 
SICAV at the end of the financial year. 
 
Basis of opinion 
 
Audit terms of reference 
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of professional practice applicable in 
France. We believe that the information we collected is sufficient and appropriate as a basis for 
our opinion. 
 
Our responsibilities pursuant to these standards are set out in the section of this report entitled 
"Statutory Auditor's responsibilities regarding the audit of the Annual Financial Statements". 
 
Independence 
 
We conducted our audit assignment in line with the rules of independence that apply to us, 
during the period from 30 March 2019 to the date of issue of our report, and in particular we 
did not provide any services forbidden by the Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors.

SICAV  Justification of assessments 
OSTRUM   
SOUVERAINS EURO  In accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial 
  Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we would inform you that, in our 
Financial year ended 31  professional opinion, the most significant assessments we conducted were based on the 
March 2020  appropriateness of the accounting principles applied, in particular regarding the financial 
instruments held in the portfolio, and on the overall presentation of the financial statements in 
terms of the chart of accounts for open-ended undertakings for collective investment. 
 
The assessments were made as part of our audit of the Annual Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, established under the aforementioned conditions, and therefore contributed to the 
formation of the opinion expressed above. We thus have no comment to make on any individual 
aspect of these annual financial statements. 
 
Specific verifications 
 
We  also  performed  specific  verifications  required  by  the  relevant  legal  and  regulatory 
provisions and in accordance with professional auditing standards in France. 
 
We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the Annual 
Financial Statements of the information given in the Board of Directors' management report 
and in the other documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial position and 
the Annual Financial Statements. 
 
We certify that the information required by Article L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code 
is contained in the section of the management report devoted to corporate governance. 
 
Responsibilities  of  senior  management  and  those  persons  in  charge  of  corporate 
governance relating to the annual financial statements 
 
It is the management's responsibility to prepare annual financial statements that give a true and 
fair view, in accordance with French accounting rules and principles, and to implement the 
internal controls it deems necessary for the preparation of annual financial statements that are 
free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
When preparing the annual financial statements, it is the responsibility of senior management 
to assess the SICAV's ability to continue as a going concern, to present in said financial 
statements, where applicable, the necessary information relating to its viability as a going 
concern, and to apply the going concern accounting policy unless it intends to wind up the 
SICAV or to cease trading. 
 
The Annual Financial Statements have been prepared by the Board of Directors.

SICAV  Statutory auditor's responsibilities regarding the audit of the annual financial statements 
OSTRUM   
SOUVERAINS EURO  It is our responsibility to draft a report on the annual financial statements. Our aim is to obtain 
  reasonable assurance that the annual financial statements, taken as a whole, are free of material 
Financial year ended 31  misstatement. Reasonable assurance corresponds to a high level of assurance but does not 
March 2020  guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with the standards of professional practice can 
systematically detect any material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material where it can reasonably be expected that, taken individually or 
together, they may influence the economic decisions made by users of the financial statements 
that are based upon such misstatements. 
 
As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our task is to certify the 
financial statements, and not to guarantee the viability or the quality of the management of your 
SICAV. 
 
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with the professional practice standards applicable 
in France, the statutory auditor exercises their professional judgement throughout this audit. In 
addition: 
 
•  they identify and assess the risks that the annual financial statements may contain 
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, set out and implement the audit 
procedures intended to counter these risks and collate the items that they deem 
sufficient and appropriate to justify their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than that of a material misstatement due to error 
because fraud can involve collusion, forgery, voluntary omissions, misrepresentation 
or circumvention of internal control processes; 
 
•  they take note of the internal control processes relevant to the audit to set out audit 
procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances and not to express an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the internal control processes; 
 
•  they assess the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of the accounting estimates made by the management, as well as the information about 
them provided in the annual financial statements; 
 
•  they assess the appropriateness of the application by the Management Company of the 
going concern accounting policy and, based on the evidence gathered, whether or not 
there is significant uncertainty relating to events or circumstances that may affect the 
Fund's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the 
information  gathered  up  to  the  date of  their  report,  on  the understanding  that 
subsequent events or circumstances may affect its viability as a going concern. If they 
conclude that there is significant uncertainty, they draw the attention of the reader of 
the report to the information provided in the Annual Financial Statements about this 
uncertainty or, if this information is not provided or is not relevant, they issue a 
certification with reservation or a refusal to certify;

SICAV  •  they appraise the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and assess 
OSTRUM  whether said statements reflect the transactions and underlying events, thus providing a 
SOUVERAINS EURO  true and fair view thereof.
