Letter from  
the Chairman
 
Geoff Wilson AO 
 
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
WAM Global delivered strong investment portfolio 
+45.9% 
performance and a record total shareholder return during the 
record total shareholder 
Company’s third year. On behalf of the Board of Directors, 
return in FY2021 
and the team at Wilson Asset Management, I would like to 
thank all shareholders for your continued support during 
what has been a challenging year.  
WAM Global achieved a record operating profit before tax of   
+42.9% 
$137.0 million (FY2020: $7.1 million) and a record operating profit 
after tax of $95.9 million (FY2020: $5.0 million) in 2021. The record 
increase on the FY2020 
operating profit for the year is reflective of the investment  fully franked full year 
portfolio’s 30.7% increase in the 12 months to 30 June 2021,  dividend 
outperforming the MSCI World Index (AUD) by 3.2%. The strong 
investment portfolio performance and the narrowing of the share 
price discount to NTA combined with the payment of increased 
fully franked dividends led to a record total shareholder return of  10.0 cents  
45.9% during the 12-month period to 30 June 2021.  
per share 
The Board declared a FY2021 fully franked full year dividend of 10.0 
FY2021 fully franked  
cents per share. Since inception in June 2018, WAM Global has paid 
full year dividend 
14.0 cents per share in fully franked dividends to shareholders. As 
at 31 July 2021, the Company’s profits reserve was 59.2 cents per 
share and forms part of the net tangible assets (NTA), representing 
5.9 years of dividend coverage for shareholders, before the 
payment of the fully franked final dividend of 5.0 cents per share.  5.0 cents  
per share 
As a WAM Global shareholder, I thank Lead Portfolio Manager 
Catriona Burns, Portfolio Manager Nick Healy, Equity Analyst 
FY2021 fully franked  
William Liu, and the broader Wilson Asset Management investment 
final dividend 
team, for their diligence, rigour and commitment. The team has 
again delivered strong, risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.

Chairman’s letter 
Company performance  
Over four decades of investing, I have found three key measures crucial to the evaluation of a listed 
investment company’s (LIC) performance: investment portfolio performance, net tangible asset growth 
and total shareholder return.  
1)  Investment portfolio performance  FY2021  
investment p ortfolio 
Investment portfolio performance measures the growth of the 
performance
underlying portfolio of equities and cash before expenses, fees and 
taxes. A key objective of WAM Global is to outperform the MSCI World  +30.7%
Index (AUD) by growing the investment portfolio at a greater rate,   
which is called outperformance. The MSCI World Index (AUD) is also 
measured before expenses, fees and taxes. 
 
Since  
1   2 yrs 
inception  
yr  %pa 
Performance at 30 June 2021  % pa (Jun-18) 
WAM Global Investment Portfolio  30.7%  16.0%  12.6% 
MSCI World Index (AUD)  27.5%  15.6%  13.6% 
Outperformance  +3.2%  +0.4%  -1.0% 
 
Investment portfolio performance and Index returns are before expenses, fees and taxes to compare to the relevant index which is also before expenses, fees and taxes.
WAM Global’s investment portfolio increased 30.7% in the year to 30 June 2021, while holding on 
average 5.0% of the investment portfolio in cash.  
 
 
2)  Net tangible asset (NTA) growth  FY2021 NTA growth
+24.1%
NTA growth is the change in value of the Company’s assets, less 
liabilities and costs (including tax, management and performance fees).   
The NTA represents the realisable value of the Company and is 
provided to shareholders and announced to the ASX each month. 
 
WAM Global’s pre-tax NTA increased 24.1% in the 12 months to 30 June 2021, including the 9.0 cents 
per share of fully franked dividends paid to shareholders during the year. This increase is after the  
8.5 cents per share of corporate tax paid during the year. The 3.7% in corporate tax payments made 
throughout the period was the major item of difference between the investment portfolio performance 
of 30.7% and the NTA performance of 24.1%. The franking credits attached to corporate tax payments 
are available for distribution to shareholders through fully franked dividends. Other items contributing 
to the change in the value of the assets during the year were management fees of 1.25%, other company 
related expenses of 0.3% and capital management decretion of 1.4% in relation to options exercised 
during the period.

3)  Total shareholder return (TSR)  FY2021 TSR
+45.9%
TSR measures the tangible value shareholders gain from share price 
growth and dividends paid over the period, before the value of any   
franking credits distributed to shareholders through fully franked 
dividends. 
 
This measure shows the tangible return to shareholders, being the change in the share price together 
with dividends paid, assuming their reinvestment. The significant growth in the Company’s assets 
resulting from the strong investment portfolio performance, the narrowing of the share price discount 
to NTA and the increased fully franked dividends paid during the 12-month period led to a record TSR 
of 45.9%. As at 30 June 2021, the share price discount to NTA was 3.9% (FY2020: discount of 18.1%). 
Dividends 
The Board declared a fully franked final dividend of 5.0 cents per share, bringing the fully franked full 
year dividend to 10.0 cents per share, which represents a 42.9% increase on FY2020 and a 25.0% 
increase on the fully franked final dividend. Since inception in June 2018, WAM Global has paid 14.0 
cents per share in fully franked dividends to shareholders.  
The Board is committed to paying a stream of fully franked dividends to shareholders, provided the 
Company has sufficient profits reserves and franking credits, and it is within prudent business 
practices. As at 31 July 2021, the Company had 59.2 cents per share available in its profits reserve, 
before the payment of the fully franked final dividend of 5.0 cents per share. The Company’s ability to 
generate franking credits is dependent upon the payment of tax on profits. The dividend reinvestment 
plan is available to shareholders without a discount.

Chairman’s letter 
Growing WAM Global to the benefit of all shareholders 
The Board is committed to effectively and efficiently growing the Company to the benefit of all 
shareholders. As the Company’s size increases, on market liquidity for the shares is expected to 
increase, as well as the Company’s relevance in the market, improving the prospect of broker and 
research coverage and interest from financial planners. The increased size of the Company is also 
expected to reduce the fixed expense ratio to the benefit of all shareholders. 
Bonus Issue of Options 
On 10 February 2021, the Board of Directors announced a one-for-one Bonus Option Issue to all 
shareholders of the Company, at no additional cost. Each WAM Global Option provides holders with the 
opportunity, but not the obligation, to purchase one additional WAM Global share for $2.54 per Option, 
without paying brokerage fees. The Options can be exercised at any time until they expire on Monday 
12 September 2022. The Options are currently trading on the ASX under the code WGBO. Shareholders 
who exercise their options before 17 November 2021 will be eligible to receive the fully franked final 
dividend of 5.0 cents per share. 
Transfer of assets to WAM Strategic Value Limited 
On 28 June 2021, WAM Strategic Value Limited (ASX: WAR) commenced trading on the ASX. WAM 
Strategic Value purchased a portfolio of LICs and listed investment trusts held by the Wilson Asset 
Management Group, including WAM Global, under a deed. The deed and the terms of the purchases 
were disclosed in Section 10.3 of WAM Strategic Value’s Prospectus dated 17 May 2021. 
WAM Global and Templeton Global Growth Fund set to merge 
On 29 June 2021, WAM Global and Templeton Global Growth Fund Limited (ASX: TGG) announced they 
have entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to merge the two entities. Templeton Global 
Growth Fund is a LIC investing in global equities managed by Franklin Templeton Investments Australia 
Limited. Under the proposed transaction, TGG shareholders will have the option to receive either new 
WAM Global shares and options or cash equal to the Company’s NTA per share. The WAM Global Board 
of Directors believe the merged entity will equitably and efficiently grow the Company's net assets up to 
approximately $962 million*, and more than 17,700 shareholders*, making WAM Global one of the largest 
global LICs on the ASX.

Catriona Burns 
 
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
The 2021 financial year closed as it had begun, with resurgent economic growth facing the 
challenges posed by a new coronavirus variant and all eyes on central bank movement.  
We were pleased to deliver strong investment portfolio performance of 30.7% for shareholders in the 
year to 30 June 2021, outperforming the MSCI World Index (AUD) by 3.2%, while holding an average of 
5.0% in cash.  
Returns for the financial year were driven by the consistent application of our rigorous investment 
process. We focus on investing in companies with solid earnings growth potential, high quality 
management teams and strong industry positions. 
We took advantage of dynamic market conditions, identifying cyclically exposed businesses which had 
been oversold during the initial onset of the pandemic, however used the crisis to improve their 
competitive position. We believe these names will continue to recover and outperform companies that 
lack valuation support but have benefitted from extremely supportive monetary policy.  
We have consistently held a significant portion of the portfolio in companies we believe are well placed 
to benefit from longer term structural trends including those accelerated by the pandemic. These 
include areas such as: health and wellness, digital payments, e-commerce, automation and 
infrastructure.  
We have taken a balanced approach to portfolio construction and geographic spread as we enter the 
new financial year and are excited about the portfolio of companies we own. We remain focused on 
finding businesses to invest in that offer compelling upside without excessive valuations or leverage, 
and we continue to find exciting opportunities that fit our investment process. 
Thank you for your continued support.

Wilson Asset Management Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
As the Chief Executive Officer of Wilson Asset Management, I want to thank our fellow shareholders for 
their support and loyalty throughout the financial year. WAM Global (ASX: WGB) is your company and I 
am pleased to share some exciting updates and insights from the year with you.  
I extend my sincere thanks to Lead Portfolio Manager Catriona Burns, Portfolio Manager Nick Healy and 
Equity Analyst William Liu, who contribute immensely to our team and culture. We are fortunate to have 
them in the Wilson Asset Management Family.  
Wilson Asset Management prides itself on being a dedicated, high-performing business, committed to 
best serving our shareholders. During the year, we promoted several team members in recognition of 
the exceptional quality of their work, including: Nick Healy to Portfolio Manager; Shaun Weick to Senior 
Equity Analyst; Cooper Rogers to Senior Equities Dealer; Ophelia Lam to Finance Manager; Huseyin 
Dervish and Lillie Johnson to Finance Team Leaders; Andrew Finch to Senior Investment Operations 
Administrator; and Isabel Mills to Assistant Financial Accountant.  
Our team continues to grow and we were pleased to welcome several new additions to the Wilson Asset 
Management Family, including in our Investment, Corporate Affairs, Finance and Operations teams.  
About Wilson Asset Management

Philanthropy 
Wilson Asset Management created and is the lead supporter of Australia’s first LICs to deliver both 
investment and social returns: Future Generation Australia (ASX: FGX) and Future Generation Global 
(ASX: FGG). Since listing in 2014 and 2015, the companies have supported young Australians who are 
at-risk or experiencing mental ill-health.  
Wilson Asset Management is a member of the global philanthropic Pledge 1% movement, is a significant 
funder of many Australian charities and provides all team members with $10,000 each year to donate to 
charities of their choice. All philanthropic investments are made by the Investment Manager. 
We are honoured to provide support to Olympic athletes, through managing over $9 million for the 
Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) on a pro bono basis. The AOC provides crucial financial and 
institutional support to Australian athletes to compete at an Olympic level. All fees are foregone by the 
Investment Manager. 
Wilson Asset Management is proud to be a founding donor of the Indigenous Residential College being 
built by the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The first of its kind in Australia, the college is a 
product of deep and continuing consultation with local and national communities. Importantly the 
college is Indigenous designed and led, creating a culturally embedded and collaborative space which 
will support Indigenous students to become the next generation of global change makers, policy makers 
and community leaders. 
The team at Wilson Asset Management is proud to have supported the film In My Blood It Runs, which 
depicts 10-year-old Dujuan Hoosan’s struggles with identity, education and the youth justice system in 
the Northern Territory. As a result of this important film, Dujuan became the youngest person to ever 
address the United Nations Human Rights Council calling for the need to raise the age of criminal 
responsibility in Australia and to highlight the critical need for Aboriginal-led education models. 
Advocacy  
Our advocacy work on behalf of retail investors in the Australian equity market is an utmost priority. We 
firmly believe all shareholders, both retail and wholesale, should be treated equitably when investing in 
the Australian equity market. On 11 December 2020, we lodged a submission to the Senate Select 
Committee, in an effort to stop retail investors being locked out of discounted capital raisings, which are 
only open to wholesale investors.  
We also participated in the public debate and formal consultation about permanently removing the 
requirement for annual general meetings (AGM) to be conducted in person. We are firmly opposed to 
this change as it would undermine AGM transparency and board accountability, primarily impacting 
retail shareholders. I would like to thank all shareholders for their support in advocating for retail 
shareholders' rights and for your emails, letters and phone calls sharing your personal stories. We were 
pleased to see Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg endorse our preferred hybrid model for AGMs, 
ensuring the requirement for AGMs to be conducted in person and virtually. We look forward to holding 
our AGMs in person when it is safe to do so. 
We also remain committed to education initiatives which advocate for change and progress in corporate 
Australia. We supported the University of New South Wales’ School of Mathematics and Statistics’ Girls 
Do The Maths program, which aims to inspire girls in high school to consider tertiary studies and 
careers in mathematics and statistics. We believe in the importance of gender diversity in the financial 
services industry, in particular funds management, which provide rewarding career paths.

•  deliver a stream of fully franked dividends; and 
•  preserve capital. 
Investment process – the world’s most compelling undervalued growth companies  
WAM Global provides investors with access to Wilson Asset Management’s two distinctive processes:  
•  a research-driven process focused on identifying undervalued companies; and  
•  a market-driven process that takes advantage of mispricing opportunities. 
Research-driven investing  
This investment process involves diligent and deep research that focuses on free cash flow, return on 
equity and the quality of a company. Each company is carefully rated with respect to management, 
earnings growth potential, valuation and industry position. Under this process, our investment team will 
only ever invest in a security once we can identify a catalyst or event that we expect will change the 
market’s valuation of the company. 
 
Market-driven investing 
This investment process takes advantage of short-term mispricing opportunities in the global equity 
market, rather than investing in any individual companies or a portfolio of companies for a prolonged 
period of time. Opportunities are derived from initial public offerings, placements, block trades, rights 
issues, corporate transactions (such as takeovers, mergers, schemes of arrangement, corporate spinoffs 
and restructures), arbitrage opportunities, short-selling and trading market themes and trends.

Directors’ Report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2021 
Directors’ Report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2021 
The Directors present their report together with the financial report of WAM Global for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2021. 
Principal activity 
The principal activity of the Company is making investments in listed global securities. The Company’s 
investment objectives are to provide capital growth over the medium-to-long term, deliver a stream of 
fully franked dividends and preserve capital. No change in this activity took place during the year or is 
likely in the future. 
Operating and financial review 
Investment operations over the year resulted in an operating profit before tax of $136,980,382 (2020: 
$7,126,951) and an operating profit after tax of $95,929,814 (2020: $5,049,644). The operating profit for 
2021 is reflective of the strong investment portfolio performance over the year. The WAM Global 
investment portfolio increased 30.7% during the period. This performance was achieved whilst being an 
average 95.0% invested in equities. As at 30 June 2021, WAM Global held 64 companies in the 
investment portfolio.  
The operating profit for the year includes unrealised gains or losses arising from changes in the fair 
value of the investments held in the portfolio and foreign currency movements during the year. This 
movement in the fair value of investments and foreign exchange rates can add to or reduce the realised 
gains and losses on the investment portfolio, foreign currency and other revenue from operating 
activities (such as dividend and interest income) in each year. This treatment under the Accounting 
Standards, can cause large variations in reported operating profits between years.  
The operating profit for each financial year is reflective of the underlying investment portfolio 
performance and is important to understand with context to the overall performance of equity markets 
in any given year. As a result, we believe the more appropriate measures of the financial results for the 
period are the investment portfolio performance, the change in net tangible assets (NTA) and fully 
franked dividends, together with total shareholder return.  
Further information on the three key listed investment company performance measures and the 
operating and financial review of the Company is contained in the Chairman’s letter. 
Financial position 
The net asset value of the Company as at 30 June 2021 was $615,174,160 (2020: $478,753,760). Further 
information on the financial position of the Company is contained in the Chairman’s letter. 
Significant changes in state of affairs 
There was no significant change in the state of affairs of the Company during the year ended 30 June 
2021.

Directors’ Report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2021 
After balance date events 
Since the end of the year, the Directors declared a fully franked final dividend of 5.0 cents per share to 
be paid on 26 November 2021.  
No other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of the financial year, other than already 
disclosed, which significantly affect or may significantly affect the operations of the Company, the 
results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Company in subsequent financial years. 
Future developments 
The Company will continue to pursue investment activities – primarily investing in equities listed on 
Global Securities Exchanges – to achieve the Company’s stated objectives.  
The Company’s future performance is dependent on the performance of the Company’s investments. In 
turn, the performance of these investments is impacted by investee company-specific factors and 
prevailing industry conditions. In addition, a range of external factors including economic growth rates, 
interest rates, exchange rates and macro-economic conditions impact the overall equity market and 
these investments. 
As such, we do not believe it is possible or appropriate to accurately predict the future performance of 
the Company’s investments and, therefore, the Company’s performance.  
Environmental regulation 
The Company’s operations are not regulated by any environmental regulation under a law of the 
Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. 
Indemnification and insurance of officers or Auditors 
During the financial year, the Company paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring the Directors of 
the Company, the Company Secretary and any related body corporate against liability incurred as such 
by a Director or Secretary to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001. The contract of 
insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability and the amount of the premium. No 
indemnities have been given or insurance premiums paid during or since the end of the financial year, 
for any person who is or has been an auditor of the Company. 
Proceedings on behalf of the Company 
No person has applied for leave of Court to bring proceedings on behalf of the Company or intervene in 
any proceedings to which the Company is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of 
the Company for all or any part of those proceedings. 
The Company was not a party to any such proceedings during the year. 
 
Non-audit services  
During the year Pitcher Partners, the Company’s auditor, performed taxation and other services to the

Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
1. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements are general purpose financial statements that have been prepared in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, Australian Accounting Interpretations, other 
authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 
2001.  
WAM Global is a for-profit entity for financial reporting purposes under Australian Accounting 
Standards. 
The financial report was authorised for issue on 18 August 2021 by the Board of Directors. 
WAM Global is a listed public company, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. 
Australian Accounting Standards set out the accounting policies that the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board has concluded would result in financial statements containing relevant and reliable 
information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply. Compliance with Australian 
Accounting Standards ensures that the Company’s financial statements and notes also comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the IASB. Material accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are presented below and have been 
consistently applied unless stated otherwise. 
Except for cash flow information, the financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and 
are based on historical costs, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities which have 
been measured at fair value. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars.  
In accordance with ASIC Corporations (rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191, 
the amounts in the Directors’ Report have been rounded to the nearest dollar, unless otherwise 
indicated. 
The Company has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued 
by the Australian Accounting Standards Board that are mandatory for the current reporting period.  
a) Financial assets and financial liabilities  
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. For financial assets, trade date accounting is adopted, which is 
equivalent to the date that the Company commits itself to purchase or sell the assets. 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs related to financial 
instruments are expensed to the Statement of comprehensive income immediately.  
       
WAM Global Limited  wilsonassetmanagement.com.au  31 
  Annual Report 2021  ABN 76 624 572 925 
 
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
1. Significant accounting policies (cont’d) 
a) Financial instruments (cont’d) 
Classification and subsequent measurement 
Financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value. Current market prices for all quoted 
investments are used to determine fair value. For all listed or unlisted securities that are not traded in 
an active market, valuation techniques are applied to determine fair value, including recent arm’s length 
transactions and reference to similar instruments. 
The Company classifies its financial instruments into the following categories: 
(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets are classified ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ when they are held for trading for the 
purpose of short-term profit taking. Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in 
fair value are included in the Statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
(ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial liabilities such as borrowed stock are classified ‘at fair value through profit or loss’. Realised 
and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the Statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Derecognition 
Financial assets are derecognised where the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expires or the 
asset is transferred to another party whereby the Company no longer has any significant continuing 
involvement in the risks and benefits associated with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised 
where the related obligations are either discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between 
the carrying value of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value 
of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in 
the Statement of comprehensive income. 
b) Income tax 
The charge of current income tax expense is based on profit for the year adjusted for any non-
assessable or disallowed items. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or are 
substantially enacted at the reporting date. Current tax liabilities/(assets) are measured at the amounts 
expected to be paid to/(recovered from) the relevant taxation authority. 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet method in respect of temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements. 
No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a 
business combination, where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is 
realised or liability is settled. Deferred tax is credited in the Statement of comprehensive income except 
where it relates to items that may be credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
adjusted directly against equity.

Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
1. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)  
b) Income tax (cont’d) 
Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised, to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the 
deferred tax asset can be utilised. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it 
is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and 
liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where a legally enforceable right of 
set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net 
settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in 
future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be 
recovered or settled. 
c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, at call deposits with banks or financial institutions and 
term deposits maturing within six months or less. 
d) Revenue and other income 
Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method, which, for floating rate financial 
assets, is the rate inherent in the instrument. Dividend revenue is recognised when the right to receive a 
dividend has been established. All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). 
e) Foreign currency translation 
The financial statements of the Company are presented in Australian Dollars, which is the Company’s 
functional and presentation currency, as determined in accordance with Australian Accounting 
Standard AASB 121: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.  
Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated into Australia Dollars using the exchange 
rate at the transaction date. At each reporting date, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currency are retranslated using the rates prevailing at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains or 
losses resulting from the settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities will be recognised in 
the Statement of comprehensive income. Net exchange gains and losses arising on the revaluation of 
investments will be included in net gains or losses on financial assets in the Statement of financial 
position. 
f) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value. 
They are subsequently stated at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment. Refer to Note 1(g) 
for further detail.  
g) Impairment of assets 
The Company applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a 
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables from initial recognition (this has replaced the 
incurred loss model). All the trade receivables of the Company share the same credit risk 
characteristics. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others,

Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
1. Significant accounting policies (cont’d) 
g) Impairment of assets (cont’d) 
the Standard & Poor’s credit risk rating of a debtor, and a failure to make contractual payments for a 
period of greater than 30 days past due. 
Impairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment losses 
within the Statement of comprehensive income. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the same line item. As at 30 June 2021, there are no expected credit losses 
recognised (2020: nil). 
h) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are non-derivative financial liabilities and are stated at amortised cost. 
i) Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised exclusive of GST, except where the amount of GST 
incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST 
is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. 
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of GST. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or 
payable to, the ATO is included as part of receivables or payables in the Statement of financial position. 
Cash flows are presented in the Statement of cash flows on a gross basis (inclusive of GST), except for 
the GST component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows. 
j) Comparative figures 
When required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to 
changes in presentation for the current financial year. 
k) Profits reserve 
The profits reserve is made up of amounts transferred from current and retained earnings that are 
preserved for future dividend payments. 
l) Issued capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
m) Dividends 
Dividends are recognised when declared during the financial year. 
n) Critical accounting estimates and judgments 
The Directors evaluate estimates and judgments incorporated into the financial statements based on 
historical knowledge and the best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable 
expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data. 
There are no estimates or judgments that have a material impact on the Company’s financial results for 
the year ended 30 June 2021. All material financial assets are valued by reference to quoted prices and 
therefore no significant estimates or judgments are required in respect to their valuation.

    41,050,568  2,077,307 
Effective tax rate    30.0%  29.1% 
The effective tax rate reflects the corporate tax rate applicable to the company of 30% and the benefit 
to the Company of franking credits and foreign income tax offsets received on dividend income during 
the year. The increase in the effective tax rate on the comparative year is reflective of the lower 
proportion of franked dividend income received in comparison to the net profit before tax for the period. 
*Other non-assessable items relate to timing differences on franked dividends receivable.

9. Issued capital (cont’d) 
c) Capital management 
The Board manages the Company’s capital by regularly reviewing the most efficient manner by which 
the Company deploys its capital. At the core of this, the Board is of the belief that shareholder value 
should be preserved through the management of the level of distributions to shareholders, share 
placements, share purchase plans, option issues and share buy-backs. These capital management 
initiatives will be used when deemed appropriate by the Board. The Company is not subject to any 
externally imposed capital requirements.

Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021 
15. Financial risk management 
The Company’s financial instruments consist of listed investments, trade receivables and trade 
payables. The risks exposed to through these financial instruments are discussed below and include 
credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk consisting of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other 
price risk. There have been no substantive changes in the types of risks the Company is exposed to, 
how these risks arise, or the Board’s objective, policies and processes for managing or measuring the 
risks during the year. 
Under delegation from the Board, the Manager has the responsibility for assessing and monitoring the 
financial market risk of the Company. The Manager monitors these risks daily. On a formal basis, the 
investment team meet daily to monitor and manage the below risks as appropriate. 
a) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other 
party by failing to discharge a contracted obligation. The Manager monitors the credit worthiness of 
counterparties on an ongoing basis and evaluates the credit quality of all new counterparties before 
engaging with them. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets, excluding investments of the Company which 
have been recognised in the Statement of financial position, is net of any expected credit losses. 
The Manager is responsible for ensuring there is appropriate diversification across counterparties and 
that they are of a sufficient quality rating. The Manager is satisfied that the counterparties are of 
sufficient quality and diversity to minimise any individual counterparty credit risk. The majority of the 
Company’s receivables arise from unsettled trades at year end which are settled three days after trade 
date. Engaging with counterparties via the Australian Securities Exchange facilitates the Company in 
both mitigating and managing its credit risk on an ongoing basis. 
Credit risk is not considered to be a major risk to the Company as the majority of cash and term 
deposits held by the Company or in its portfolios are invested with major Australian banks and their 
100% owned banking subsidiaries that have a Standard and Poor’s short-term rating of A-1+ and long-
term rating of AA-. The Company also holds cash with its custodian that has a Standard and Poor’s 
short-term rating of A-1 and long-term rating of A. The majority of all maturities for cash and term 
deposits are within six months. 
None of the assets exposed to a credit risk are overdue or considered to be impaired.  
 
b) Liquidity risk  
Liquidity risk represents the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations 
associated with financial liabilities. 
The Company’s major cash payments are the purchase of securities and dividends paid to shareholders, 
the levels of which are managed respectively by the Manager and the Board. 
The Company’s cash receipts depend upon the level of sales of securities, dividends and interest 
received and the exercise of options or other capital management initiatives that may be implemented 
by the Board from time to time.

15. Financial risk management (cont’d) 
b) Liquidity risk (cont’d) 
The Manager monitors the Company’s cash flow requirements daily by reference to known sales and 
purchases of securities, dividends and interest to be paid or received. Should these decrease by a 
material amount the Company can alter its cash outflows as appropriate. The Company also holds a 
portion of its portfolio in cash and term deposits sufficient to ensure that it has cash readily available to 
meet all payments. Furthermore, the assets of the Company are largely in the form of tradable securities 
which, where liquidity is available, can be sold on market when and if required. 
The table below reflects an undiscounted contractual maturity analysis for the Company’s liabilities. 
The timing of cash flows presented in the table to settle liabilities reflects the earliest possible 
contractual settlement date to the reporting date.

c) Market risk  
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange and other 
market prices will affect the fair value or future cash flows of the Company’s financial instruments. 
By its nature, as a listed investment company that invests in tradable securities, the Company will 
always be subject to market risk as it invests its capital in securities which are not risk free, as the 
market price of these securities can fluctuate. 
(i) Interest rate risk 
The Company’s interest bearing financial assets expose it to risks associated with the effects of 
fluctuations in the prevailing level of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows. The 
Company however is not materially exposed to interest rate risk as the majority of its cash and term 
deposits mature within six months. As the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is not significant, 
interest rate sensitivities have not been performed.

(ii) Foreign exchange risk 
The Company invests in global listed securities and enters into transactions that are denominated in

in exchange rates that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of future cash flows of the 
Company’s cash, receivables and financial assets denominated in currencies other than Australian 
dollars.

Sensitivity analysis  
For foreign currency exposure held by the Company at the end of the reporting period, a sensitivity 
analysis was performed relating to its exposure to other price risk. This analysis demonstrates the 
effect on current year net assets after tax as a result of a reasonably possible change in the risk 
variable. The sensitivity assumes all other variables to remain constant. 
Foreign currency exposure represents 100.6% (2020: 98.4%) of net assets at year end. A 5.0% 
movement in the foreign exchange rate of each of the above currency exposures would result in a 3.5% 
(2020: 3.4%) movement in the net assets after tax. This would result in the 30 June 2021 net asset 
backing after tax moving by 9.2 cents per share (2020: 7.8 cents per share). 
(iii) Other price risk 
Other price risk is the risk that the value of an instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market 
prices, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or all factors affecting 
all instruments traded in the market.

c) Market risk (cont’d)  
(iii) Other price risk (cont’d) 
As the majority of the Company’s investments are carried at fair value with fair value changes 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, all changes in market conditions will directly 
affect net investment income. Due to the short-term nature of receivables and payables, the carrying 
amounts of these financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair values. 
The Manager seeks to manage and reduce the other price risk of the Company by diversification of the 
investment portfolio across numerous stocks and multiple industry sectors. The relative weightings of 
the individual securities and market sectors are reviewed daily in order to manage risk. The Company 
does not have set parameters as to a minimum or maximum amount of the portfolio that can be 
invested in a single company or sector. 
The Company’s industry sector weighting of gross assets as at 30 June 2021 is as below: 
2021  2020 
Industry sector    %  % 
Industrials    22.2  6.5

Sensitivity analysis  
For investments held by the Company at the end of the reporting period, a sensitivity analysis was 
performed relating to its exposure to other price risk. This analysis demonstrates the effect on current 
period net assets after tax as a result of a reasonably possible change in the risk variable. The 
sensitivity assumes all other variables to remain constant. 
Investments represent 96.0% (2020: 88.0%) of gross assets at year end. A 5.0% movement in the fair 
value of each of the investments within the investment portfolio would result in a 3.5% (2020: 3.1%) 
movement in the net assets after tax. This would result in the 30 June 2021 net asset backing after tax 
moving by 9.2 cents per share (2020: 7.0 cents per share).

d) Financial instruments measured at fair value 
AASB 13: Fair Value Measurement requires the disclosure of fair value information using a fair value 
hierarchy reflecting the significance of the inputs in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy 
consists of the following levels: 
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). 
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
Included within Level 1 of the hierarchy are listed investments. The fair values of these financial assets 
and liabilities have been based on the closing quoted last prices at the end of the reporting period, 
excluding transaction costs.  
Included within Level 2 of the hierarchy are WAM Global’s investments in initial public offerings and 
convertible notes which settle after 30 June 2021. The initial public offerings have been valued at cost 
and the fair value of the convertible notes have been recognised using the effective interest rate 
method inherent in the instrument or by assessing the movement in observable inputs which have been 
traded on active markets. 
There were no transfers between levels during the year (2020: nil).

Report on the Audit of the Financial Report 
 
Opinion  
 
We have audited the financial report of WAM Global Limited (“the Company”), which comprises 
the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2021, the statement of comprehensive income, 
the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, 
and the directors’ declaration.  
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of WAM Global Limited is in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including: 
 
i.  giving a true and fair view of the Company’s financial position as at 30 June 2021 
and of its financial performance for the year then ended; and  
 
ii.  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 
2001. 
 
Basis for Opinion  
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Report section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the  auditor  independence  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  the  ethical 
requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (“the Code”) that

ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  
 
We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which 
has been given to the Directors of the Company, would be on the same terms if given to the 
Directors as at the time of this auditor’s report. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report  
 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal controls as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the financial report, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to 
liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report  
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.  
 
As part of an  audit  in accordance  with  the Australian  Auditing  Standards,  we  exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:  
 
•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
 
•  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.  
 
•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
 
•  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial  report  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a 
going concern.  
 
•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
To the Members of WAM Global Limited 
ABN 76 624 572 925 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report (Continued) 
 
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.  
 
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and 
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.  
 
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
