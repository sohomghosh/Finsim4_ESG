REPORTING DIRECTIVE 
 
23 September 2021 
 
 
The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and its 54 undersigned signatories (representing 
approximately 9.2 trillion USD in AUM) welcome the European Commission’s proposal for a new 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) revising the Non-Financial Reporting 
Directive (NFRD), and its aim to elevate sustainability information to the same level as financial 
information. The CSRD proposal is a prime example of policy coherence between investor and 
corporate disclosure obligations, building an end-to-end disclosure framework that will enable 
investors to scale up their contribution to the EU Green Deal and wider sustainability goals. 
 
Investors regularly report to the PRI that a lack of consistent and comparable sustainability information is 
a substantial barrier to their responsible investment practice. For investors selling and/or marketing 
products in the EU, access to comparable, consistent and high-quality corporate sustainability disclosure 
is even more important to meet the increasing sustainability-related disclosure requirements under 
regulations such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and EU Taxonomy. 
 
In this statement we set out six key aspects of the CSRD proposal which co-legislators should take into 
consideration to align the CSRD with the EU sustainable finance strategy and enable investors to 
actively contribute to the EU’s high ambition for a green recovery and emission reduction targets of at 
least 55% by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.  
 
 
Scope extension 
We welcome the extension of the scope of companies reporting under the CSRD to all large companies 
and all companies listed on regulated markets (except listed micro-enterprises). Investors need 
sustainability information from all large public interest and listed companies. However, the scope of the 
CSRD should be increased further to include non-listed SMEs from ‘high-risk sectors’. This is particularly 
important for fixed income and private equity investors. Too many exceptions could pose a risk to both 
investors and investees; an investor might need to exclude certain investees from its’ portfolio given a 
lack of disclosure on material sustainability information. This limits portfolio scope for investors and 
reduces funding opportunities for certain companies.  
 
Double materiality and integrated reporting 
We fully support the principle of double materiality in the CSRD proposal and the clarifying language in 
the proposed Directive. Information on a company's impacts on society and the environment is 
increasingly needed by investors, particularly when seeking to respond to disclosure requirements such 
as the SFDR. We therefore also support the proposal to integrate sustainability information into the 
annual management report alongside financial information. 
 
 
 
Assurance 
Sustainability information is material for investment-decision making and reported information needs to 
be accurate and reliable. Therefore, we welcome the introduction of an EU-wide assurance requirement 
and encourage co-legislators to provide a clear timeline for moving from limited assurance to reasonable 
assurance as soon as possible. 
 
Standards setting  
We welcome the mandate provided to EFRAG and the development of European sustainability reporting 
standards. This is expected to increase the consistency and comparability of reported information. These 
standards should reflect Europe’s high ambition in sustainable finance and contribute to international 
standard-setting initiatives driven by IFRS and IOSCO to establish a global common baseline on 
enterprise value creation. 
 
Single Electronic Reporting Format  
We welcome the single electronic reporting format described in the CSRD proposal as it will enable 
investors to use and compare reported information more easily. In addition, this format will support the 
initiative on the establishment of a European Single Access Point (ESAP) for financial and sustainability 
information publicly disclosed by companies. The ESAP can enhance data accessibility and credibility 
and therefore help investors identify ESG risks and opportunities, understand sustainability performance 
in the context of social and environmental goals and implement sustainable finance disclosure 
obligations. 
 
Timeline 
A rapid conclusion of negotiations is of high importance to investors. There is a need to ensure that 
sustainability information is available in a timely manner to ensure that financial market participants can 
fulfil their own disclosure obligations.
