engage with the companies in which they invest. To add

we have appointed EOS to provide voting advice to the

Collaboration
Collaborative initiatives and activities are very important  
to give the investment industry a more powerful and 
effective voice. We encourage managers to participate in 
these initiatives.
One example is Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative 
aiming to ensure the world’s largest corporate greenhouse 
gas emitters take necessary action on climate change. It 
targets 167 companies globally. EOS is among over 575 
investors, totalling $54tn under management, who have 
signed up to the initiative. EOS is leading or co-leading the
