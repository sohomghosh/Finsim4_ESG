Through the SGS Academy we deliver  
professional training that contributes to  
knowledge development. Our courses cover a wide 
range of topics, from health and safety to leadership 
and process management. Graduates gain the skills 
and knowledge to stay up-to-date with industry 
regulations and best practice, giving them the 
opportunity to advance their careers.
When companies enroll their employees in SGS 
Academy training courses they benefit from talent 
development and retention, enhanced service quality, 
competitiveness and productivity, and reduced 
employee risks. We have calculated this economic 
benefit to our customers as delivering a value to 
society of CHF 2601 million in Financial Capital. At the 
same time, course attendees are benefiting from better 
career opportunities and increased employability. This 
increases their potential to earn higher salaries, which 
in 2018 brought with it a value to society of CHF 1301 
million in intellectual capital. 17

SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS 2020: 2019 PERFORMANCE
In 2019, we continued to deliver excellent results against our Sustainability Ambitions 2020. Notably, we remained well within our target for both our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) at 57% 
and our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) at 60%, since 2014. Our natural turnover also remained on target and we continued to make gradual progress towards our goal to have 30% of 
leadership positions held by women. We had already achieved our annual CO emissions targets, and we continued to demonstrate our commitment in this area. In the communities where

we operate, we contributed a total investment of CHF 1.41 million. We also continued to grow our measurable value to society.

RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Evaluating and managing the risks associated with climate 
change is a priority for SGS. While our business operations may 
not be as energy intensive and resource depleting as some other 
industry sectors, we are a multinational company that is exposed 
to various types and degrees of local, regulatory, physical and 
socio-economic risks associated with climate change. These 
risks have the potential to impact our organization, and together 
with the opportunities that climate change may also present, 
they will shape the SGS of tomorrow.

(% of total managers by gender) / female employees) divided by (male managers / male employees). If EOR is 1, then female employees have as much opportunities as male employees to reach a managing 
position. 3. Days of sickness absence per total days worked. 4. Training and Hours spent cost per Total employment cost, including safety training hours (on a constant

Framework. SGS supports the principle of integrated reporting. 
This year we have moved forward again with our alignment to the 
Integrated Reporting Framework by using the six capitals as the 
structure of our Integrated Annual Report.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 
Standards: Comprehensive option and using the guidelines for 
the AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard.
SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Reporting on our sustainability performance indicators in a 
consistent and accurate manner is essential for transparent 
reporting. We follow the GRI Standards as a basis of
