Company profile
Argo shares offer investors a low cost, 
professionally managed entry to the 
Argo Investments Limited was 
Australian sharemarket.
established in 1946 and is a leading 
Australian listed investment company  Argo is ranked by market capitalisation in the 
top 100 companies listed on the Australian 
with a market capitalisation at 30 June 
Securities Exchange (ASX code: ARG).
2020 of $5.2 billion.
Argo seeks to provide long-term capital 
growth and a regular income stream to over 
92,000 shareholders.
Argo’s total assets were $5.3 billion at 30 June 2020 and are invested predominantly in the 
shares of companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).
Argo's Board of Directors and management team are both experienced and highly qualified, which 
are considered essential qualities for the effective surveillance of a long-term investment portfolio. 
The Board currently consists of six Non-executive Directors and the Managing Director.
The investment philosophy followed by Argo is straightforward. Management aims to provide 
consistent tax-effective income combined with long-term capital growth, by investing in a 
diversified portfolio of securities. The portfolio contains investments in 89 companies and trusts 
representing a cross section of Australia’s enterprises, including a number with substantial 
overseas operations. A long-term investment philosophy is adopted in selecting the portfolio 
which extends beyond the larger companies to include smaller companies where there is 
judged to be good quality management and prospects for sound earnings growth.
Successful equity investing depends on good quality research and analysis. Argo’s investment 
team includes the Managing Director and a number of specialist research analysts. The research 
has two objectives: to monitor the portfolio of leading stocks and smaller companies, and  
to find new investments to complement the portfolio. The investment goal is to identify  
well-managed businesses with the potential and ability to generate growing and sustainable 
profits to fund increasing dividend payments.
Due to the spread of investments within the Company’s portfolio, Argo shares are particularly 
suitable for investors who seek to maximise long-term returns through a balance of capital 
and dividend growth. This could include investors who are looking for broad exposure to the 
Australian sharemarket, passive investors and self-managed superannuation funds.
Argo shares can be purchased through any sharebroker and the market price of the  
shares is quoted on the ASX. There are no fees charged to Argo shareholders. Being a 
securities exchange listed company, only stockbrokers' charges apply.

Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 10
Directors’ Report
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Summary of business model
Argo Investments Limited is a listed investment company which actively manages a diversified 
Australian equities portfolio in a tax-aware manner within a low-cost structure, with the 
objective of maximising long-term returns to shareholders through a balance of capital and 
dividend growth.
Argo generates the majority of its income by ‘harvesting’ the dividends and distributions 
received from the companies and trusts in its investment portfolio. Additional income is 
derived from interest earned on cash deposits, premium income from selling exchange-traded 
options, a small amount of share trading activity and fee income from managing an external 
listed investment company. Dividends and distributions made up 93% of Argo’s income 
from operating activities for the financial year, with the portfolio’s top 20 equity investments 
generating 62% of that income.
Argo’s operational costs are relatively stable and are lower than those of most other managed 
investment products due to its internally managed listed investment company structure. In the 
2020 financial year the Company’s total operating costs were equivalent to 0.16% of average 
assets, which is very low by industry standards. Argo’s main expense items are remuneration, 
share registry fees and office rent.
The above characteristics make for an efficient business model which benefits from economies 
of scale. The low proportion of variable costs implies that in general, profit will fluctuate 
according to the performance, and in particular the dividend payout policies, of each of the 
companies and trusts in the investment portfolio. At balance date there were 89 different stocks 
in the portfolio, providing the Company with dividend income from a diverse range of industries.
The majority of Argo’s profit is paid out as dividends to its shareholders, with fully franked 
dividends a priority. Argo has paid dividends every year since it was established in 1946.
Argo shares offer investors a professionally managed, diversified and easily traded exposure to 
the Australian equity market, without the need to pay fees to an external investment manager.
For the last 20 years, the Company’s investment portfolio has produced a compound return of 
+8.0% per annum, as measured by the movement in net tangible asset backing (NTA) per share 
assuming dividends paid are reinvested. This return is after payment of all costs and tax and 
compares to a return of +7.4% per annum from the S&P ASX 200 Accumulation Index, which 
does not take into account any costs or tax. In addition, Argo’s total shareholder return (TSR) 
based on the share price over the same 20 year period was +8.5% per annum, and +10.3% 
including the franking credits attached to the dividend payments.
In addition to managing Argo’s portfolio and operations, the Company’s wholly owned 
subsidiary, Argo Service Company Pty Ltd, manages an external listed investment company, 
Argo Global Listed Infrastructure Limited (ALI). The management activities are carried out by 
Argo personnel and include administration, financial reporting, company secretarial duties 
and supervision of ALI’s share registry, asset custodian and its US-based portfolio manager. 
11 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Directors’ Report
Investment process
The investment team, led by the Managing Director, is responsible for constructing and 
maintaining an appropriately diversified portfolio which generates dividend income and  
long-term capital growth.
The investment process, which involves the monitoring and review of existing investments as 
well as analysing potential new investments, includes extensive research, company visits and 
industry studies, as well as economic analysis to help identify emerging trends and assist with 
the timing of transactions.
The closed-end structure of a listed investment company is ideally suited to building a  
long-term portfolio, as Argo does not experience investor redemptions which might otherwise 
force desirable long-term holdings to be sold. Instead, shareholders wishing to liquidate their 
holding in Argo simply sell their shares on the share market. This stability allows Argo to take 
advantage of short-term market fluctuations in order to buy or add to long-term holdings when 
prices trade below the long-term valuations calculated by the investment team. 
Review of activities and events during the year ended 30 June 2020
The first half of the financial year produced positive returns for the Australian share market, 
despite the threat of global trade wars and the devastating summer bushfires. Our market was 
trading at records highs in late February 2020, when the quintessential black swan event hit the 
world.
The COVID-19 pandemic saw global equity markets post some of their steepest ever falls in 
March, exacerbated by dramatic oil price weakness. Many countries imposed strong lockdown 
and social distancing measures to help minimise the spread of infections, prompting swift and 
unprecedented responses from central banks and governments to do ‘whatever it takes’ to help 
protect jobs and limit the damage to economies.
In Australia, the S&P ASX 200 Index lost just over a third of its value from its high in February, 
with the Australian dollar dropping sharply at the same time to a 17-year low of US$0.55. As 
the crisis developed and the economic outlook became increasingly uncertain, many ASX-
listed companies withdrew their earnings guidance and cancelled, cut or deferred dividends 
payments.
However, as time passed, some governments became more concerned with economic risks than 
health risks, and started to re-open their economies in stages. Despite the lack of a vaccine for 
the virus, investors quickly became optimistic about economic recovery and markets bounced 
back strongly over the last quarter of the financial year. The Australian share market recovered 
by nearly 30% to 30 June 2020 following massive economic stimulus packages from the Federal 
Government and interest rate cuts to record lows.
The majority of industry sectors in Australia recorded negative returns for the financial year, 
including energy, banks, capital goods, insurance, consumer discretionary and property. The 
sectors which held up well in the face of the virus impacts to record positive returns were 
consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, information technology and healthcare.
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 12
Directors’ Report
These price movements, together with active portfolio management decisions, have seen a shift 
in the composition of Argo’s top 10 holdings over the year. By 30 June 2020, CSL had become 
our largest holding followed by Macquarie Group, with the major banks slipping down the order.
Operationally, the impacts of social distancing on Argo’s staff and administrative and investment 
functions have been minimal. Argo has been well placed to cope, given its small workforce 
located in two separate offices and the nature of its operations, most of which can be 
conducted remotely. Regular meetings with our investee companies have continued online.
During the year, $243 million was outlaid on long-term investment purchases and $127 million 
was received due to disposals and takeover proceeds. The larger movements in the long-term 
portfolio during the year included:
Purchases  Sales 
AP Eagers (Automotive Holdings takeover) AMP
Downer EDI Ansell
Freedom Foods Group Automotive Holdings (AP Eagers takeover) **
Oil Search Corporate Travel Management **
Ramsay Health Care Dulux Group (Nippon Paint takeover) **
Suncorp Group Milton Corporation
Treasury Wine Estates * Nufarm **
*  New portfolio position
**  Sale of complete position and removal from portfolio.
Other stocks exited were Incitec Pivot, Paragon Care and Regis Healthcare, with the total 
number of holdings in the portfolio decreasing from 95 to 89.
There were a number of capital raisings by corporates as the COVID-19 crisis developed. During 
April, Argo participated in raisings by Invocare, Lendlease Group, Monash IVF Group, Oil Search, 
QBE Insurance Group, Ramsay Health Care and Reece.
At the end of an extraordinary year, Argo’s investment portfolio had returned -10.1% after 
deducting all costs and tax (measured by the movement in NTA assuming dividends paid are 
reinvested) and Argo’s share price performance returned  -7.8% for the financial year, with the 
share price at a slight discount to NTA after trading at a premium for the first few months of the 
COVID-19 crisis.
Argo's portfolio underperformed the broader Australian share market over the financial year, 
due chiefly to underweight positions in information technology and gold stocks, which have 
risen strongly in price. These sectors tend to be under-represented in Argo's portfolio as their 
dividend payments are generally relatively low.
There has been no change to the composition of the Board of Directors during the financial 
year.
13 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Directors’ Report
Discussion of results and financial position
Argo's reported profit for the year ended 30 June 2020 was 31.9% lower than the prior year 
and earnings per share fell by 32.4%. This significant reduction was due to two factors. Firstly, 
the prior year's profit included a $36.1 million one-off income item arising from the demerger 
of Coles Group from Wesfarmers. Secondly, the effects of COVID-19 caused many of our 
investee companies to cut or defer the dividends we would have otherwise received in the 
second half of the financial year. 
The biggest dividend income declines for Argo occurred in the financial sector, with substantial 
dividend cuts or deferrals from ANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking 
Corporation and Macquarie Group.
Income from option writing and trading increased this year, although interest received on cash 
deposits was slightly lower, reflecting lower interest rates and less cash on hand.
Dividends are very important to Argo shareholders, and after seven consecutive years of 
increased annual dividends, the Company has been unable to provide another increase due to 
the effects of the COVID-19 crisis and the very uncertain outlook for the coming 2021 financial 
year. The final dividend is 3 cents lower than last year, at 14 cents per share fully franked.
Argo’s total assets decreased from $6.1 billion to $5.3 billion over the financial year, chiefly due 
to the impact of the weaker equity market on the portfolio value. Shareholders also contributed 
$44.9 million through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The number of Argo shareholders has 
increased again this year, with 92,342 holders on the register at 30 June 2020, including a sharp 
jump in new holders at the time of the steepest market falls in March.
The cash assets at year end were $178.7 million, representing 3.4% of the Company’s total 
assets. Cash on hand fluctuates throughout the year according to the timing of dividends 
received, dividends paid, capital raisings, and investment purchases and disposals.
One measure of the financial position of a listed investment company is its net tangible  
asset backing (NTA) per share. As a long-term investor, Argo does not intend to dispose of its  
entire long-term investment portfolio. Therefore, when calculating NTA, Argo values its portfolio 
using the market price of each listed holding, without providing for estimated tax on gains that 
would be realised if the entire portfolio was to be sold. At 30 June 2020, this valuation resulted 
in a NTA per share of $7.27, 13.7% lower than the 30 June 2019 level of $8.42. However, if 
estimated tax on unrealised gains in the portfolio was to be deducted, the NTA per share at  
30 June 2020 would have been $6.56, compared with $7.37 at 30 June 2019. Both NTA figures 
are updated monthly and announced to the ASX.
Future prospects, strategies and risks
The Company has cash available for additional long-term investment in the equity market, and 
will continue to focus on producing results in accord with its stated investment objective.
The results of Argo’s future investment activities will depend primarily on the performance 
of our investee companies, their resulting share price movements and the dividends and 
distributions we receive from them. Clearly, those prospects will be significantly impacted by the 
health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but to what extent and for how long is 
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 14
Directors’ Report
virtually impossible to predict. In addition, there will also be specific issues such as management 
competence, capital strength, industry trends and competitive behaviour which can affect our 
investee companies.
The benefit of a diversified portfolio is that different companies will be affected in different ways, 
helping to balance out some of the short-term impacts.
Active portfolio management may require some of the worst-affected stocks to be sold, but Argo 
is a long-term investor and must also consider the possibilities and opportunities in a post-COVID 
world, bearing in mind that some industries and consumer trends will not be able to revert to 
their former state.
Argo will continue to focus on controlling costs and providing tax-effective dividends to 
shareholders while achieving long-term capital growth. 
We expect our dividends to shareholders will remain under pressure whilst governments, 
central banks, and individual companies grapple with the economic fallout of COVID-19.
Although the constantly changing nature of markets and other investment conditions requires 
the Company to diligently appraise any opportunities that may present themselves, Argo does 
not envisage any significant changes to its business model which has stood the test of time 
through many other adverse events. 
MATTERS ARISING SINCE YEAR END
The Directors are not aware of any matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of 
the financial year which has significantly affected or may significantly affect the Company’s 
operations, the results of those operations or the Company’s state of affairs in future financial 
years except as stated elsewhere in this report.
DIVIDENDS
A fully franked interim dividend of 16.0 cents per share was paid on 8 March 2020.
On 17 August 2020, the Directors declared a fully franked final dividend of 14.0 cents per share 
to be paid on 18 September 2020. 
Total fully franked dividends for the year amount to 30.0 cents per share. This compares with 
33.0 cents per share last year.
The final dividend paid by the Company for the financial year ended 30 June 2019 of  
$121.5 million and referred to in the Directors’ Report dated 12 August 2019 was paid  
on 13 September 2019.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) raised $44.9 million of new capital for investment during 
the year.
The DRP will operate for the 14.0 cents per share dividend payable on 18 September 2020 and 
the Directors have resolved that the shares will be allotted to eligible shareholders at the market 
price of Argo shares, as defined by the DRP. No discount will apply.

Directors’ Report
SHARE BUY-BACK
The Company has an on-market share buy-back in place, in order that its shares can be bought 
back and cancelled where they can be purchased at a significant discount to the net tangible 
asset backing per share. Any such purchases have the effect of increasing the value of the 
remaining shares on issue.
No share buy-backs occurred during the year.
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS
The Company indemnifies its past, present and future Directors against liabilities arising out 
of their position with the Company, except where the liability arises out of conduct involving a 
lack of good faith. The deed stipulates that the Company will meet the full amount of any such 
liabilities, including costs and expenses.
The Company has paid a premium in respect of a Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy 
covering the liability of past, present or future Directors and Officers, including executive officers 
of the Company. The terms of the policy prohibit disclosure of the details of the amount of 
insurance cover and the premium paid.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Details of the amounts paid or payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers for audit and non-audit 
services provided during the year are set out in Note 28 to the financial statements on  
page 65 of this report.  
The Board has considered the position and, in accordance with advice from the Audit & Risk 
Committee, is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the 
general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 for the 
following reasons:
(a) all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit & Risk Committee to ensure they do 
not impact the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor; and
(b) the non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to audit 
independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.
The Auditor’s Independence Declaration, as required under Section 307C of the Corporations 
Act 2001, is set out on page 38.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
The Company’s operations are not directly affected by environmental regulations.
ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations (Rounding in  
Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191 applies to the Company and accordingly 
amounts have been rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars in accordance with that 
Instrument, unless otherwise stated.

Directors’ Report
Section 1  Principles of remuneration 
The Board recognises that remuneration plays an important role in the delivery of Argo’s 
business objectives and ongoing performance. The Board seeks to achieve the right balance 
of motivation, challenge and reward for its executives to encourage sustainable delivery of 
shareholder returns. 
The key principles of Argo’s remuneration strategy are:
•  Align remuneration structure with shareholder interests
•  Attract and retain talent
•  Link a significant component of remuneration with the creation of shareholder value 
through relative outperformance
•  Ensure remuneration is competitive and fair
Alignment of the long-term interests of shareholders and executives is achieved by a significant 
component of executive pay being performance based. This encourages executives to take a 
long-term approach to decision making and business success without taking excessive risks. 
The equity component of any Short-term Incentive (STI) reward is deferred for a two year period 
and performance under the Long-term Incentive (LTI) is measured over a four year period.  The 
actual remuneration received by executives is subject to Board discretion and reflective of the 
ongoing performance of the Company over an extended period.
Remuneration reward is measured on a relative basis, reflecting the Company's profitability 
relative to its peer group and its investment performance relative to the ASX 200 share  
market index.

Section 2  Executive remuneration structure 
The remuneration structure to reward the Company’s executives includes a mix of fixed 
remuneration and short and long-term performance based ‘at risk’ remuneration which 
reflects both Company and individual performance.

and independent advice 
Performance linked remuneration
The Short-term Incentive (STI) and Long-term Incentive (LTI) are described as ‘at risk’ because 
the amount earned (if any) depends on the extent that key performance conditions are met or 
exceeded.

Directors’ Report
Changes to executive remuneration for year ended 30 June 2020
Total Portfolio Return (TPR) Performance measurement
The Company's TPR Performance is one of two financial performance indicators used to 
determine STI and LTI awards. In order to better compare Argo's TPR Performance to the 
benchmark S&P ASX 200 Accumulation Index, TPR Performance will no longer be grossed up for 
franking credits on dividends paid to shareholders.
Instead, TPR will be adjusted to remove the effect of company tax paid by Argo, which will better 
align with the index returns which are not subject to company tax. 
LTI vesting proportions when TPR outperformance is achieved
To better align executive remuneration with shareholder outcomes the vesting conditions for 
the LTI TPR tranche of performance rights has increased from 25% vesting to 40% vesting if 
the performance hurdle of matching the movement in the S&P ASX 200 Accumulation Index 
over the performance period is achieved. If outperformance of the performance hurdle (by 
up to +100 bps) is achieved, then the number of performance rights to vest into shares will be 
calculated on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
These changes have been applied to performance rights granted for the financial year ended 30 
June 2020.

Other remuneration benefits
Argo Employee Share Ownership Plan
All employees other than the Directors are offered up to $1,000 per year in Company shares 
at market value. The costs of acquiring the shares on market are paid by the Company. Any 
shares acquired cannot be disposed of or transferred until the earlier of three years from the 
acquisition date or the date the employee ceases employment.
Non-monetary benefits
Prior to 2004, interest free loans were issued to KMP to assist the purchase of shares in the 
Company. Table H on page 35, sets out the remaining balances of those KMP loans and the 
benefit of the interest not charged to the executives.
Additional conditions applying to Performance Rights
Service condition discretion
A service condition applies to the STI and LTI performance rights, which means vesting is subject 
to the individual executives remaining in service. The Board has discretion however to allow 
the Performance Rights to vest in certain circumstances which could include death, incapacity, 
redundancy and retirement.
Clawback of executive remuneration
The Board has the discretion to claw back unvested performance rights if, after they have been 
granted, a material misstatement is discovered in the Company’s accounts.
Prohibition of hedging
The Company’s Securities Trading Policy prohibits executives from entering into arrangements 
which limit the economic risk of unvested Performance Rights.

Section 3  Relationship between remuneration and Company performance
The Company’s remuneration structure includes STI and LTI incentives to align executive 
remuneration outcomes with the interests of shareholders. The Company’s objective of 
maximising long-term returns to shareholders through a balance of capital and dividend growth is 
reflected in the STI and LTI performance indicators. 
The table and charts below show relevant aspects of the Company’s annual results and how they 
translate into executive remuneration outcomes when measured over the periods applicable to 
STI and LTI. The Company’s relative performance as compared to its Australian listed investment 
company peers and the ASX 200 Accumulation index is closely linked to remuneration actually 
received by executives as the STI and LTI performance indicators comprise these relative measures.

This table clarifies payments actually received by the executives for the year under review.
These amounts are different to the statutory remuneration as Accounting Standards require 
a value to be placed on performance rights at the time of grant which is expensed over the 
life of the rights, even though the executives may not realise all (or any) actual value from the 
performance rights if performance and/or service conditions are not met, or are only partly 
met. Remuneration details prepared in accordance with statutory obligations and Accounting 
Standards are contained in Section 6 of this Report.

Directors’ Report
Section 4  Non-executive Directors’ remuneration 
Non-executive Directors (NEDs) are awarded fixed fees, allowing for objectivity and 
independence in their assessment of Company and executive performance. However, the Board 
has a policy that all NEDs should, within three years of their initial appointment, establish and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company which is at least equivalent in value to one year's 
directors’ fees, to further align their interests with those of other shareholders.
The Board, after taking into account the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, 
determines the amount of Board and Committee fees having regard to the level of fees paid 
to NEDs of companies of comparable size and complexity. The fees are within the aggregate 
annual limit approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in October 2015 
($1,100,000). 
For the year ended 30 June 2020, the Chairman received $237,300 inclusive of superannuation, 
Committee and subsidiary company appointments. The base fee for each of the other NEDs was 
$101,500 with additional fees of $3,500 for Committee membership and subsidiary company 
board appointments, and $6,700 for Committee Chairs. Statutory superannuation payments 
are contributed on behalf of NEDs with any superannuation guarantee exemption being paid 
as Directors' fees. Further details of the Non-executive Directors' remuneration are provided in 
Section 6, Table C on page 30 of this report.
Due to the current economic circumstances, NED remuneration will remain unchanged for the 
year ending 30 June 2021.
A performance evaluation process for NEDs is undertaken each year and is described in the 
Corporate Governance Statement, which is available on the Company’s website.

Section 5  Remuneration governance
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee provides support and advice to the Board on setting appropriate 
remuneration levels, determining the remuneration structure and assessing performance.
External advice
The Remuneration Committee periodically engages independent external advisers to review and 
assist with aspects of the remuneration structure.
In 2015, the Financial Institutions Remuneration Group (FIRG) was engaged by the 
Remuneration Committee to assist it with a comprehensive review of executive remuneration 
compensation. No changes were recommended to the Board as a result of this review.
The Company’s membership of FIRG provides it with access to up to date industry remuneration 
data on an ongoing basis.
Executive service agreements
Key features of the service agreements for the executives include:
–  Employment continues until terminated by either the executive or Argo
–  Notice periods are six months for the Managing Director and three months for other 
executives
–  A lump sum in lieu of notice may be paid
–  If an executive commits a breach such as serious misconduct, wilful neglect or criminal 
offence, their services may be terminated immediately, without notice
–  If the Company commits any serious or persistent breach, an executive may terminate 
immediately
–  Unless stated otherwise above, no termination payments are provided for under the 
service agreements
–  Compliance with policies of the Company including the Code of Conduct

reversed and the amount previously recognised for individual executives is also reversed.
(g) Argo Investments Limited Executive STI Performance Rights:
The values of the STI performance rights are calculated and allocated to each reporting 
period from the commencement of the performance period to the vesting date. The value 
of STI performance rights for the current reporting period, which are yet to be issued to 
executives, has been estimated.
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 32
Directors’ Report
(h) Argo Investments Limited Executive LTI Performance Rights:
The fair value of the LTI performance rights granted was calculated by estimating the value 
of dividends an award recipient would not receive during the performance measurement 
period and subtracting this amount from the value of the grant date share price, and 
applying the Monte Carlo simulation.
Argo Employee Share Ownership Plan:
Employees received $1,000 of Company shares at market value pursuant to the Argo 
Employee Share Ownership Plan.
(i)  The Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance contract does not specify premiums in respect 
of individual Directors and Officers and the policy also prohibits disclosure of the premium 
paid.

(1) The STI and LTI performance rights granted do not have an exercise price and no amount is 
payable by the recipient.
(2) The minimum value of STI and LTI performance rights yet to vest is $nil as the performance 
and service conditions may not be met and consequently the STI and LTI performance rights 
may not vest.
(3) The maximum value yet to vest of STI performance rights has been determined as the 
amount of the fair value of the STI performance rights from the commencement of the 
performance period to the vesting date that is yet to be expensed.
The maximum value of LTI performance rights yet to vest has been determined as 
the amount of the grant date fair value of the LTI performance rights that is yet to be 
expensed.
Ultimately, the value received from STI and LTI performance rights will be determined by the 
quantity of rights that vest and the market value. 
(4) The maximum value yet to vest of STI performance rights which are expected to be granted 
on 8 October 2020 has been determined as the estimated fair value of the STI performance 
rights yet to be expensed.
(5) The value of STI and LTI performance rights exercised during the year is calculated as the 
market price of shares of the Company on the date the performance rights were exercised.
(6) The 2015 LTI performance rights lapsed on 9 November 2019 because the performance 
condition was not fully satisfied.
35 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Directors’ Report
(7) The value of LTI performance rights that lapsed during the year represents the benefit 
forgone, and is calculated at the date the rights lapsed assuming the performance condition 
had been satisfied. Rights granted 26 October 2015 have a fair value of $6.41.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 17 August 2020.  
The Directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.
The significant accounting policies which have been adopted in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied, unless 
otherwise stated.
(a) Basis of Preparation
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
Australian Accounting Standards, interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. Compliance with Australian Accounting 
Standards ensures that the financial statements and notes comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards. The Company is a ‘for profit’ entity for the purpose of 
preparing the financial statements.
These financial statements have been prepared using the conventional historical cost 
basis except for the fair value accounting of investments detailed in Note 1(d)(ii) and 
exchange traded options in Note 1(e).
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
(b) Principles of Consolidation
The Company meets the definition of an investment entity (see Note 1(c)).
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Argo Service Company Pty Ltd (ASCO), 
provides services to the Company. The consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the assets and liabilities of ASCO as at 30 June 2020 and its results for the year then 
ended. Intercompany transactions and balances between the Company and ASCO are 
eliminated on consolidation.
The Company has determined that for any entities that it controls or has significant 
influence over, that do not provide services to the Company, consolidation is not 
required provided the Company measures its investments in these entities at fair value 
in its financial statements.
(c) Investment Entity
The Company has determined that it is an investment entity under the definition in 
AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements as it meets the following criteria:
(i)  The Company has obtained funds from shareholders for the purpose of providing 
them with investment management services;
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 44
Notes to the Financial Statements
(ii) The Company’s business purpose, which it communicated directly to shareholders, is 
investing solely for returns from capital appreciation and investment income; and
(iii) The performance of investments made by the Company are measured and 
evaluated on a fair value basis.
The Company also meets all of the typical characteristics of an investment entity.
(d) Investments
(i)  Classification
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, being the date the 
Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Current Assets
Investments classified as Current Assets comprise holdings of trading securities and 
are categorised as financial assets measured at fair value through the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit or Loss. Investments are initially recognised at fair value and 
transaction costs are expensed. An investment is classified in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Non-Current Assets
Investments classified as Non-Current Assets comprise holdings of long-term 
securities and are revalued at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
Investments are initially recognised at fair value.
(ii) Valuation
Trading securities and long-term securities are continuously carried at fair value 
using price quotations in an active stock market.
The fair value of securities which are not listed on a securities exchange are valued 
using appropriate valuation techniques as reasonably determined by the Directors.
(iii) Gains and Losses
Investments are considered to have been sold when contractual rights to the 
investment expire or contractual rights to receive cash flows have been transferred 
and substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership have not been retained.
Current Assets
Realised gains and losses from the sale of trading securities are included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the trading 
securities are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the period 
in which they arise.
45 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Notes to the Financial Statements
Non-Current Assets
Realised gains and losses on the sale of long-term investments, net of tax, are 
transferred from the investment revaluation reserve and recorded in the capital 
profits reserve.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of long-term 
securities are recognised in other comprehensive income and reflected in the 
investment revaluation reserve.
(e) Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company sells Australian Securities Exchange traded options to earn income. Where 
the Company sells a call option, it is obligated to deliver securities at an agreed price if 
the holder exercises the option. Where the Company sells a put option, it is obligated to 
purchase securities at an agreed price if the holder exercises the option.
The premium received for selling options is not initially brought to account as income 
but is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as a liability. When 
the option expires, is exercised or is repurchased, the premium received is brought 
to account and is included in net gains on trading investments in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit or Loss.
Any open option positions at balance date are carried at their fair value and unrealised 
gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
(f)  Income
Income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(g) Property, Plant and Equipment
Items of plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives to  
the Company using the straight line method of depreciation at rates ranging from 
7.5% to 33.3%.
Items of property right of use assets are depreciated on a straight line method over 
the period of the lease.
(h) Income Tax
The income tax expense is the tax payable on current year taxable income based on the 
company tax rate, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable 
to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax 
losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those 
temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the 
same taxation authority. 
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 46
Notes to the Financial Statements
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax 
rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on 
those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted. The relevant tax rates are 
applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to 
measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary 
differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax 
asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in 
a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did 
not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax balances attributable to revaluation amounts recognised in other 
comprehensive income are also recognised in the investment revaluation reserve. 
The revaluation of long-term investments is net of tax on unrealised capital gains by 
recognising a deferred tax liability. Where the Company disposes of long-term securities 
in the investment portfolio, tax is calculated on the net gains made according to the 
particular parcels allocated to the sale for tax purposes. The tax recognised in the 
investment revaluation reserve is then transferred to the capital profits reserve. The 
associated deferred tax liability is similarly adjusted and transferred to tax payable.
Argo Investments Limited (the parent) and its wholly owned subsidiary have formed an 
income tax consolidated group. Each entity in the group recognises its own current and 
deferred tax amounts. The current tax liability of both entities is subsequently assumed 
by the parent entity.
The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement whereby the subsidiary 
compensates the parent entity for any current tax payable or receivable and deferred tax 
assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits.
(i)   Employee Entitlements
Provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages, salaries, 
annual leave and long service leave (based on wage rates expected at the time of settling 
the liability) when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of 
being reliably measured.
The obligations are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the entity does 
not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the 
reporting date, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.
(j)  Argo Investments Limited Executive Performance Rights Plan
The share based short-term incentive (STI) performance rights are measured at fair value. 
The amount of these rights is expensed on a straight line basis over the period between 
the performance commencement date and the expected date that the rights will vest.
The share based long-term incentive (LTI) performance rights are measured at fair value, 
and recorded as an expense on a straight line basis over the period between grant date 
and the expected date that the rights will vest. 
47 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Notes to the Financial Statements
(k) Argo Investments Executive Share Plan Loans
The interest free loans were issued to executives pursuant to the superseded Argo 
Investments Executive Share Plan and are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
(l)  Receivables
Receivables include dividends, distributions and securities sold where settlement has  
not occurred at the end of the reporting period. Amounts are generally received within 
30 days of recognition.
(m) Payables
Payables include liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company and for 
securities purchased where settlement has not occurred at the end of the reporting 
period. Amounts are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
(n) Leases
From 1 July 2019 the Company recognised operating leases as property right of use 
assets with a corresponding liability.
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. 
The property right of use assets are depreciated over the life of a lease on a straight-
line basis. Lease liabilities are accounted for over the period of the lease with lease 
payments allocated between principal and finance cost.
(o) Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents 
include bank deposits held at call, other short-term bank fixed term deposits with 
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
(p) Other Financial Cash Assets
Other financial cash assets are bank fixed term deposits with maturities from three to  
six months from date of acquisition.
(q) Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
If applicable, diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in determination of 
basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and 
other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted 
average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation 
to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 48
Notes to the Financial Statements
(r)  Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Income, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless 
the GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Accounts payable are inclusive of GST. The net amount of GST recoverable from the 
ATO is included in receivables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 
Cash flows relating to GST are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
on a gross basis.
(s) Contributed Equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares are shown in equity, net of tax.
(t)  Provision for Dividend
A provision for dividend is only made for the amount of any dividend declared by the 
Directors on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at balance date.
(u) Rounding of Amounts
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations (Rounding in 
Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191 applies to the Company and 
accordingly amounts have been rounded to the nearest one thousand dollars in 
accordance with that Instrument, unless otherwise stated.
(v) New Accounting Standards
AASB 16 Leases has been applied from 1 July 2019. This standard specifies how to 
recognise, measure and disclose leases in the financial statements. The standard 
requires lessees to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases 
which the Company has disclosed in Note 10 and 11. The application of the lease 
standard has not had a material impact on the Company's financial statements and 
there was no impact on opening Retained Profits. The nature of the leases are disclosed 
in Note 23. 
The Company adopts Accounting Standards and interpretations at the date at which 
their application becomes mandatory.
There are no other standards or interpretation that are not yet effective and that are 
expected to have a material impact on the Company in the current or future reporting 
periods and on foreseeable future transactions.
(w) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
There are no key assumptions or sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next reporting period.

Nature and Purpose of Reserves
Executive Performance Rights Reserve
This reserve contains the fair value of the short-term incentive (STI) and long-term 
incentive (LTI) performance rights pursuant to the Argo Investments Limited Executive 
Performance Rights Plan. When rights are exercised, shares are purchased on market and 
issued to the executive.
STI performance rights
The values of the STI performance rights are calculated and allocated to each reporting 
period from the commencement of the performance periods to the vesting dates. The value 
of the STI performance rights for the current reporting period, which are yet to be issued to 
participants, has been estimated.
LTI performance rights
The values of the LTI performance rights are calculated at grant dates and allocated to each 
reporting period from the grant dates to the vesting dates.
Investment Revaluation Reserve
Increments or decrements on the revaluation of long-term investments after provision for 
deferred capital gains tax are recorded in this reserve.
Capital Profits Reserve 
Gains or losses arising from the sale of long-term investments, net of any tax expense or 
benefit, are recorded in this reserve.

18. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objective in managing its capital is to maximise long-term returns 
to shareholders through a balance of capital and dividend growth from a diversified 
Australian investment portfolio. This is achieved by the process of providing shareholders 
with a steady stream of fully franked dividends and enhancement of capital invested, with 
the goal of paying an increasing level of dividends and providing attractive total returns 
over the long term.
The Company recognises that its capital will fluctuate in accordance with market conditions 
and in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, it may be necessary to vary the 
amount of dividends paid, issue new shares from time to time or buy back its own shares.
The Company’s capital consists of its shareholders’ equity and the changes to this capital are 
shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

The franking account balance would allow the Company to fully 
frank additional dividend payments up to an amount of 166,840 226,721
The Company’s ability to continue to pay franked dividends is dependent upon the receipt of 
franked dividends from the investment portfolio and the Company paying tax.

26. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
(a) Argo Employee Share Ownership Plan
The Directors may at such time or times as determined, issue invitations to eligible 
employees to apply for shares under the Argo Employee Share Ownership Plan 
(ESOP) as part of the employees’ remuneration. Each eligible employee is offered up 
to $1,000 per year in shares at market value. The costs of acquiring the shares on 
market are paid for by the Company. Any shares acquired cannot be disposed of or 
transferred until the earlier of three years from the acquisition date or on the date the 
employee ceases employment. The ESOP was approved by shareholders at the 1997 
Annual General Meeting.
During the year, 1,560 (2019: 1,560) shares were acquired by the Company on behalf 
of eligible employees under the ESOP at a cost of $12,984 (2019: $13,015) and had a 
market value of $11,216 (2019: $12,667) at $7.19 per share (2019: $8.12 per share) at 
balance date.
(b) Argo Investments Limited Executive Performance Rights Plan
The Argo Investments Limited Executive Performance Rights Plan (Plan) is designed to 
provide participants with performance-linked incentives as shareholder value is created. 
Under the Plan, performance rights are granted to executives to satisfy their STI and LTI 
entitlements. These performance rights only vest if certain performance and service 
conditions are met. Participation in the Plan is at the Board’s discretion and no individual 
has a contractual right to participate in the Plan or to receive any guaranteed benefits.
A detailed discussion of the performance and service conditions for performance rights 
granted or to be granted is set out in the Remuneration Report.
The STI and LTI performance rights are granted under the Plan for no consideration, 
carry no dividend or voting rights and do not have an exercise price.
When exercisable, each performance right is convertible into an ordinary Company 
share, subject to certain adjustments allowable under the Plan.

(1) The fair value at grant date of the STI performance rights issued during the year was 
$7.33 (2019: $6.99) and was independently calculated by estimating the value of 
dividends that would not have been received during the vesting period and subtracting 
this amount from the value of the grant date share price. The following inputs were used 
to calculate the fair value of the STI performance rights issued:
(a) Share price at valuation date 8 October 2019: $8.18 (15 October 2018: $7.80); and
(b) Dividend yield grossed up for franking credits based on historic and future yield 
estimates: 5.5% (2019: 5.5%).
(2) STI performance rights expense of $563,734 (2019: $469,495) was recognised as an 
administration expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
(3) The weighted average remaining life of the STI performance rights outstanding at the 
end of the year was 0.9 year (2019: 0.8 year).
During the year, 71,516 (2019: 72,275) shares were acquired by the Company on behalf 
of eligible employees for exercised STI performance rights at a cost of $601,676 (2019: 
$559,461) and had a market value of $514,200 (2019: $586,873) at $7.19 per share (2019:

this amount from the value of the grant date share price. The Monte Carlo simulation 
has been used to determine the probabilities of meeting the performance conditions 
and the expected level of vesting under each performance condition. The following 
inputs were used to calculate the fair value of the LTI performance rights issued:
(a) Share price at valuation date 8 October 2019: $8.18 (15 October 2018: $7.80); and
(b) Dividend yield grossed up for franking credits based on historic and future yield

end of the year was 1.9 years (2019: 1.9 years).
During the year, 66,160 (2019: 46,966) shares were acquired by the Company on behalf of 
eligible employees for exercised LTI performance rights at a cost of $563,090 (2019: $360,532) 
and had a market value of $475,690 (2019: $381,364) at $7.19 per share (2019: $8.12 per

29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The risks associated with the holding of financial instruments such as investments, cash and 
cash equivalents, other financial cash assets, receivables and payables include credit risk, 
liquidity risk and market risk.
Credit Risk
The risk that a financial loss will occur because a counterparty to a financial instrument fails 
to discharge an obligation is known as credit risk.
In relation to cash and cash equivalents disclosed in Note 6, the maximum exposure to 
credit risk is the carrying amount of bank deposits and any interest accrued.
The Company’s cash investments are managed internally under Board approved guidelines. 
Funds are invested for the short to medium term with the major Australian banks which 
have a Standard & Poor’s short-term rating of A2 and above. The maturities of bank term 
deposits in cash and cash equivalents are within three months while bank term deposits in 
other financial cash assets mature from three to six months.
The credit risk exposure for the Company’s receivables as disclosed in Note 7 is the 
carrying amount.
Credit risk exposure also arises in relation to option positions held by the Company.  
The extent of this exposure is reflected in the carrying value and is disclosed in Note 12.
None of the assets exposed to credit risk are past due or considered to be impaired.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company is unable to meet its financial obligations as they 
fall due.
The Company has no borrowings and monitors its cash flow requirements daily which 
includes the amount required for purchases of securities, the amount receivable from sales 
of securities, and dividends and distributions to be paid or received.
The Company’s inward cash flows depend mainly upon the amount of dividends and 
distributions received from the investment portfolio as well as the proceeds from the sale 
or takeover of investments. Should these inflows drop by a material amount, the Company 
would amend its outward cash flows accordingly. As the Company’s major cash outflows 
are purchases of investments and dividends paid to shareholders, the level of both is 
controllable by the Board and management.
The assets of the Company are largely in the form of tradeable securities which, if necessary, 
could be sold on market to meet obligations.
Current financial liabilities are disclosed in Note 11.
Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020 66
Notes to the Financial Statements
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the fair value of financial 
instruments.
The Company is a listed investment company that invests in tradeable securities. Due to 
the nature of its business, the Company will always be subject to market risk as it invests its 
capital in securities which have fluctuating market prices.
A general fall in the fair value of long-term investments of 5% and 10%, if equally  
spread over all assets in the long-term investment portfolio, would lead to a reduction  
in the Company’s equity of $177.4 million (2019: $201.2 million) and $354.8 million  
(2019: $402.3 million) respectively, after tax. The investment revaluation reserve at  
30 June 2020 has an after tax balance of $1,103.8 million (2019: $1,653.4 million). It  
would require a 31% (2019: 41%) after tax fall in the value of the long-term investment 
portfolio to fully deplete this reserve.
The Company seeks to reduce the market risk of the long-term investment portfolio by 
ensuring that it is not, in the opinion of the Board, overly exposed to one company or one 
particular sector of the market. The relative weightings of the individual securities and 
market sectors are reviewed and risk is appropriately managed. The Company does not have 
set parameters as to a minimum or maximum amount of the long-term investment portfolio 
that can be invested in a single company or sector.
The Company’s assets are spread across investment industry sectors as below:
2020 2019
Materials 15% 15%
Banks 14% 17%
Health Care 12% 9%
Other Financials 10% 11%
Consumer Staples  10% 7%
Industrials 7% 7%
Telecommunication Services & I.T. 6% 6%
Consumer Discretionary 6% 7%
Listed Investment Companies 5% 5%
Energy 5% 5%
Utilities 4% 4%
Cash and Short-term Deposits 3% 4%
Property 3% 3%
100% 100%
67 Argo Investments Limited  –  Annual Report 2020
Notes to the Financial Statements
The following investments represent over 5% of the investment portfolio:
2020 2019
CSL 6.1% 4.0%
Macquarie Group 5.6% 5.2%
BHP Group 5.1% 5.1%
The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments, being exchange traded 
options, are subject to market risk, as changes in market price will affect the fair value of the 
financial instrument. The Company seeks to reduce the market risk of these derivatives by 
imposing Board approved maximum exposure limits for each security and in total. The total 
exposure position is determined and monitored on a daily basis. The fair value of exchange 
traded options at balance date was $10.6 million (2019: $8.2 million) and is disclosed in  
Note 12. Investments with a market value of $100.2 million (2019: $52.0 million) were 
lodged with the ASX Clearing Corporation as collateral for any option positions written by 
the Company in the Exchange Traded Option Market.
The Company is not materially exposed to interest rate risk, as all of its cash investments and 
bank term deposits mature in the short-term and have a fixed interest rate.
The Company is not significantly exposed to currency risk, as the majority of investments 
are quoted in Australian dollars. At balance date all investments were quoted in Australian 
dollars.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company measures the fair value of its long-term investments, as required by 
Accounting Standard AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement, based on the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy:
Level 1:   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  i nputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); 
and
Level 3:   i nputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
30. LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

Independent auditor’s report
To the members of Argo Investments Limited
Report on the audit of the financial report
Our opinion
In our opinion:
The accompanying financial report of Argo Investments Limited (the Company) and its controlled 
entities (together, Argo) is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:
(a)  giving a true and fair view of Argo’s financial position as at 30 June 2020 and of its financial 
performance for the year then ended 
(b)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards  and the Corporations Regulations 2001.
What we have audited
The financial report comprises:
•	 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2020
•	 the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year then ended
•	 the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended
•	 the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended
•	 the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting 
policies
•	 the directors’ declaration.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial report section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of Argo in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical 
Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence

Our audit approach
An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is 
free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are 
considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to 
give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and 
management structure of Argo, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which 
it operates.
Materiality
•	 For the purpose of our audit we used overall materiality for Argo of $47.2 million, which 
represents approximately 1% of net assets of Argo at 30 June 2020.
•	 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the 
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to 
evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.
•	 We chose net assets as the benchmark because, in our view, net assets is:
-  the benchmark against which the performance of Argo is most commonly 
measured;
-  the key driver of the business and determinant of Argo’s value; and
-  a generally accepted benchmark for listed investment companies.
•	 We utilised a 1% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the 
range of commonly acceptable net asset related thresholds.  
Audit scope
•	 Our audit focused on where Argo made subjective judgements; for example, significant 
accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.
•	 Argo operates out of its Adelaide and Sydney offices with the finance function based 
in Adelaide. The investment management and administration operations for Argo are 
conducted by the Company’s subsidiary, Argo Service Company Pty Ltd.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, 
any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We 
communicated the key audit matters to the Audit and Risk Committee.

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2020, but does not 
include the financial report and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to 
the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report 
that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of Argo 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate Argo 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a 
whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing 
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial report.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at:  
http://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content/02/c3/ar1_2020.pdf. This description forms part
