April 2020 - April 2021 
Achieving a greater gender balance 
Report published: February 2022
A message from our Chief People Officer
At Fidelity International, we work together to build better financial 
futures. We recognise that a diverse and inclusive workplace brings 
benefits for our customers, our business and our people.  
We are committed to reducing our gender pay gap by achieving 
a greater gender balance across our business - and particularly in 
the most senior and highly-paid roles - which is a key priority of our 
wider Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.   
We have made great steps towards our gender diversity 
ambitions since we published our first gender pay gap report. The 
representation of women in UK senior leadership roles increased by 
7ppts from 24% in April 2017 to 31% in April 2021. As a result of this progress, Fidelity’s median gender 
pay gap narrowed once again over this reporting year. However, there is more for us to do on the 
mean gender pay gap and the bonus gap.
We are determined to do more and go even further to promote gender balance and parity for our 
people, our clients and the communities where we work. In response to the coronavirus pandemic, 
we have prioritised employee wellbeing, introduced dynamic working and focused on accelerating 
diversity and inclusion activities. We are proud to have launched equalised paid parental leave and 
family care leave for all our employees.  
As signatories of HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter, we are progressing towards our target to 
reach 35% women in global senior leadership roles by December 2023, as well as our broader targets 
relating to all aspects of diversity within our workforce.
Our Global Diversity & Inclusion Leadership Council will provide the highest level of executive 
sponsorship to drive further progress.
