A Message from our CEO
Dear Stakeholders,
2020 was a difficult year for every business and person across the world. The global economy and our industry were hit 
hard by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the tremendous disruption it had on each market. Amidst these challenges, SML 
put our employees’ safety and health first, ensuring all necessary actions were implemented to help minimize the health-
related risks across our operations. Through our extensive global network, we were also fortunately able to continue 
servicing our customers at the highest standard and without missing a beat when the pandemic hit. 
Despite challenging times, we also successfully released our 2021 Annual Sustainability Report which recorded our 
sustainability performance from 2018 to 2020. Establishing several ambitious goals, the report will further guide us and 
our customers towards a more sustainable future and benchmark our ongoing efforts to minimize overall environmental 
footprint and strengthened social performance. 
In 2020, we recorded considerable drops in our energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We also significantly 
increased our use in sustainable materials including recycled yarn, recycled tape and FSCTM certified papers. In addition, I 
am delighted to let you know that we have been making progress in promoting our use of non-solvent-based offset 
Ignatius K.C. Lau printing ink, which is essential in lowering our atmospheric pollutants and reducing related-health concerns.
We believe the future of the industry lies in our hands. And as such, we continue to keep our finger on the pulse of the

industry who committed to environmental goals that make a difference. Similarly, we are always exploring our own 
SML Group
solutions to prepare for the rising sustainability standard, from development in renewable energy to sourcing recycled or 
compostable materials for production.
Considering these achievements, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to our SML employees for the effort in 
supporting SML during this difficult chapter, and I am confident for the great results we are going to achieve in 2021 and 
beyond.

Our Responses to 
COVID-19
SML has quickly responded to the impacts and effects of 
⚫
the pandemic to safeguard the health and safety of our 
employees and other stakeholders. Upon the initial 
outbreak of COVID-19, we promptly released our global 
guidelines of “Preventive Measures against COVID-19 at 
Factories and Enterprises.”
In various SML offices and production sites, we have 
⚫
implemented preventive measures including work-from-
home arrangements, provision of masks and hand 
sanitizers, encouraging telecommunicating for meetings, 
and increasing the frequency our cleansing and disinfecting 
measures. 
With our effective preventive efforts against COVID-19 in

place, we managed to not cause any outbreak of infectious 
disease in our sites and protected our employees’ health 
and safety. We also significantly minimized our site closure 
days and any drops in production volume.

Environmental and Social Compliance
In 2020, no cases of either environmental or social non-compliance were 
recorded by SML and there were no significant fines and non-monetary 
sanctions for non-compliance with environmental or social laws and/or 
regulations. Conforming to our desired performance parameters highlights 
SML’s ability in managing operations. ​
Supplier Environmental and Social Assessment
We believe an environmental and social assessment is a win-win 
approach to motivate both SML employees and our suppliers to improve 
our performances. In 2020, 96% of our suppliers were screened 
accordingly. 
Continuous Training
Our employee received trainings on environmental, safety and quality 
assurance, 100+ internal, client and third-party audits were carried 
out in our sites in 2020.

Carbon Footprint Verification
In 2020, SML carried out our first-ever product carbon footprint verification project to quantify carbon footprint of our selected RFID label 
products, with the aim of comparing the carbon footprint of conventional PET RFID labels to that of our innovative EcoInspire™ RFID 
Labels.  In the EcoInspire™ RFID Labels, the PET inlay is replaced with a paper carrier. The replacement of Eco RFID inlays over 
conventional PET inlays reduces the decomposition period of our labels from between five to ten years, to just six weeks.
The study was certified to be carried out in accordance with the requirements of ISO14067:2018 “Greenhouse gases — Carbon footprint of 
products — Requirements and guidelines for quantification”.
Compared to the conventional PET RFID labels, our EcoInspire™
RFID Labels recorded a 10 – 16% decrease in product carbon 
footprint, implying a less impact on the environment. It is our 
vision to explore more innovative products to further reduce 
adverse impacts on our environment.
