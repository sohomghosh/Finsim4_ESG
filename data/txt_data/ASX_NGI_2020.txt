II    Annual Report 2020 | From the Chairman & CEO 
 
 
The past financial year has been one of both significant challenge and unique opportunity for the Navigator Group.  Not since the global 
financial crisis has our business felt such global market turmoil.  The world continues to feel the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic as 
we wait to see how and when we can settle into a ’new normal’. 
Navigator adapted to the challenges, implementing a work-from-home practice across all our offices, and embracing new forms of technology to 
see to our day-to-day business. It was the disruption to and extreme volatility of global markets early in the pandemic which presented the 
biggest challenge, and we had mixed investment results in response. 
We commenced the 2020 financial year (FY20) with $14.2 billion of assets under management (AUM), and the impacts of COVID-19 on the 
markets and the continued reduction of the client relationships acquired from the Mesirow Advanced Strategies (MAS) transaction has led to a 
closing AUM as at 30 June 2020 of $11.8 billion. 
 
Acquisition 
Whilst grappling with the pandemic impacts on the core business, Navigator continued to explore a unique opportunity for growth through 
acquisition of a portfolio of high-quality alternative investment stakes. For the past few years, we have been focused on a strategy for achieving 
growth through acquisition as well as organic growth of the Lighthouse business, and we are very pleased to have identified a transaction which 
we believe will be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
On 13 August 2020, Navigator announced that it had entered into a proposal to acquire a portfolio of six minority equity investments in 
established alternative asset managers.  The portfolio is being acquired from funds managed by Dyal Capital Partners and its affiliates.  Dyal 
Capital Partners is a leading provider of capital to alternative investment management companies globally. 
Navigator will acquire a portion of the portfolio up front from the Dyal sellers in exchange for issuing 40,524,306 Navigator shares and 10-year 
Convertible Notes convertible into 67,574,292 Navigator shares.  The shares and Convertible Notes together represent a 40% economic 
interest in Navigator on a fully diluted basis, although the Dyal sellers voting interest will be less than 20% on closing.  After five years, 
Navigator will make an additional single payment to acquire the remaining interests in the Portfolio. 
The transaction terms entitle Navigator to a preferential distribution from the portfolio’s combined cash distributions of $17 million (indexed at 
3% pa and subject to a catch-up should the preferred distribution amount not be met in a particular year), as well as 20% of earnings in excess 
of this preferred distribution amount.  After Navigator makes the final payment after five years it will acquire the rights to the remaining 80% of 
the portfolio’s combined cash distributions. 
This acquisition has a compelling strategic rationale. Each business within the acquired portfolio has a proven track record of generating strong 
returns through multiple market cycles, managing expenses and making cash distributions to partners. These high-quality minority stakes are 
expected to provide earnings diversification and support Navigator’s future earnings and dividend profile. The transaction also creates an 
ongoing partnership with Dyal Capital Partners, and can assist in Navigator’s access to a variety of future accretive, organic and inorganic 
growth opportunities.  
The transaction is subject to Navigator shareholder approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting, as well as some other regulatory 
approvals.  A full explanation of the transaction will be set out in the Explanatory Memorandum which will accompany the Annual General 
Meeting Notice of Meeting.  The Board considers that this is an important step for Navigator to deliver on a sound growth and diversification 
strategy and creates a platform for Navigator to seek and implement other acquisition opportunities. 
We encourage all of our Shareholders to vote in favour of the transaction at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. 
 
Operating performance 
Investment performance 
The 2020 financial year (FY20) was one of the most challenging we have seen in some time in terms of global market conditions, and the 
investment results of the Lighthouse investment portfolios were mixed. 
Global equity strategies showed resilience over this volatile period in the markets around March 2020, delivering positive returns whilst global 
indices saw significant negative returns.  Conversely, the multi-strategy products experienced some difficulties in key strategies, which lead to 
disappointing performance in the month of March 2020.  
This mixed investment performance creates both risk and opportunities to the assets under management of the Lighthouse business.  
Lighthouse has worked with its clients to reposition the multi-strategy portfolios to reflect the current opportunity set in this ‘new normal’.  This 
has been a key initiative in working proactively to not only retain existing assets, but to pursue potential new opportunities, particularly in the 
platform services and hedged equity space.   
We do expect, however, that reflective of the reduction to assets under management (AUM) experienced since March 2020, the operating result 
of the Lighthouse business will be lower in the 2021 financial year (FY21).   
Annual Report 2020 | From the Chairman & CEO    III 
 
F  Y 20 operating performance 
The Operating and Financial Review on pages 5 to 16 sets out detailed information on the Group’s activities for FY20.  We take this opportunity 
to highlight a few key points: 
  Navigator delivered EBITDA of $30.5m (with adjusted EBITDA of $28.3m after the attribution of cash rent payments which are no longer 
recognised in operating expenses under the AASB 16 Leases accounting standard). 
  Management fee revenue was $87.5 million for the year, a decrease of 17% on the prior year.  The main driver of the decrease in 
management fees was a 15% reduction in the average total AUM to $13.2 billion for FY20 (2019: $15.6 billion). 
  Performance fee revenue for the year was $5.6 million, an increase of $4.5 million on the previous financial year.  Despite the economic 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second half of FY20, strong investment performance in the December 2019 quarter 
resulted in positive performance achieved for certain calendar year funds and portfolios. 
  Operating expenses decreased by $5.3 million compared to the prior year. This reduction is due primarily to staff reductions 
implemented in November 2019, the completion of MAS transition expenses; and the reduction to occupancy expenses due to the 
Group’s transition to AASB 16 on 1 July 2019. 
5  -year historical performance 
The Board considers EBITDA to be the most relevant measure of the Company’s overall financial performance.  Given the nature of our 
operations, and taking into account timing differences arising from trade receivables and payables, EBTIDA is largely consistent with the cash 
flows generated by operating activities.  EBITDA for 2020 fell by 19% on the prior year, a reflection in the deterioration of operating conditions in 
the second half of the financial year, however the Board was pleased that Navigator was still in a position to pay a final dividend to 
shareholders:

IV    Annual Report 2020 | From the Chairman & CEO 
 
C  orporate governance 
Strong governance and a culture which values ethics and integrity are a key priority for the Navigator board. 
Our core values 
As a business, we are very aware that people are the heart of everything we do. 
That’s why our core values are centered around how we want employees to behave with our clients, our managers and with each other.   
These values have been the guiding force within our Lighthouse business since the beginning, and the Navigator board formally adopted  
these values in May 2019 to ensure that we articulate them externally as well as internally: 
Ethics & Integrity Teamwork Professionalism
Do the right thing at all times  Work together and use all of the  Treat all people (internally and 
     
and in all circumstances,  resources of the firm to make  externally) with respect and 
whether or not anyone is  decisions that will maximise  dignity
watching value
 
   
Client Loyalty Continuous Improvement  
& Excellence
Do more than is expected by the 
 
client All employees are responsible for 
 
  proactively achieving regular, 
incremental improvements
 
 
Corporate responsibility and sustainability 
Going hand-in-hand with our core values and focus on people is how our organisation meets its broader responsibilities as a global corporate 
citizen. 
A key objective for FY20 was for Navigator to publish a Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility Report to set out how our Group currently 
meets our environmental, social and governance responsibilities.  Unfortunately, the demands of dealing with the global pandemic, coupled with 
the significant acquisition transaction have meant that this goal was not achieved this year.   
The Board sees this as an important goal in demonstrating how our Group meets its broader responsibilities, and we are committed to ensuring 
that this is completed for FY21. 
 
Board composition  
The stability in the membership of our board over the past six years has been important to the efficient functioning of the Group.  Whilst our 
board has been relatively small with only five directors, given the singular focus of our strategy and operations on alternative investment 
management, and the diverse global locations of the various Directors, a board of this size has been the right fit for the Navigator Group until 
now. 
The proposed transaction prompted the board to review its composition, as the terms include Dyal being able to nominate a director for 
appointment to the board.  As a result, the Board considers that this is an appropriate time to appoint an additional independent, non-executive 
Director.  We are very pleased that Ms Nicola Meaden Grenham agreed to join the Navigator board and was appointed as a Director on  
8 October 2020. 
Ms Grenham brings over 30 years of knowledge and experience in the global alternative asset management sector.  Her background and skills 
are an excellent complement to the existing Directors, and she will provide valuable insight in expertise to Navigator, particularly as we embark 
on the growth path provided by the proposed transaction. 
 
 
Annual Report 2020 | From the Chairman & CEO    V 
 
 Outlook 
FY20 proved to be a busy and challenging year.  Whilst the worst of the pandemic crisis has not passed, markets have shown signs of 
stabilisation over the past few months.  However, the significant impacts to the economies of every country around the world are far from over. 
Lighthouse will keep an unwavering focus on delivering investment performance which meets the objectives of its clients and maintaining a high 
quality of service.  Complementing this will be maximizing opportunities which have arisen due to the disruption caused by the pandemic in a 
variety of areas: 
  pursuing new clients in both equity-based strategies and the platform services offerings; 
  new investment opportunities for the portfolios; 
  refining our mix of talent globally; including through access to research, data, and analysis; and  
  reviewing operating costs. 
 
Navigator delivered resilient financial performance for FY20, however the full impact of the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
underperformance of the multi-strategy funds in March 2020 will not fully impact the financial performance of the Navigator Group until the 
financial year ended 30 June 2021. 
Navigator currently expects some future redemptions across MAS and Lighthouse portfolios as a consequence of March 2020 performance and 
overall market conditions. However, Navigator also expects this to be off-set by increased interest in our equity-based strategies and platform 
services offering.  In the current market environment, the quantum and timing of changes in AUM is difficult to predict.  However, expectations 
for the Group’s FY21 performance should take into account: 
  an expectation of a lower average AUM for FY21, given the lower starting point of AUM of US$11.8 billion compared to the FY20 
average AUM of US$13.3 billion. 
  an expectation of net outflows over the coming year, although the exact quantum is unknown; 
  a continued shift towards platform service and customised client AUM which generally has lower fee rates; and 
  uncertainty as to the level of performance fee revenue which may be earned for FY21. 
 
Given the likely challenges in the core business returning to its pre-pandemic size and profitability, we are pleased that we have the opportunity 
with the proposed transaction to add significant scale and diversification to the Navigator Group.  With a strong alignment of interests through 
the issue of Navigator shares and Convertible Notes to the Dyal Sellers, we also look forward to a productive partnership with Dyal where 
Navigator may access additional acquisition opportunities. 
 
On behalf of the Directors, we would like to extend our thanks to all of our staff, who have shown resilience and adaptability in responding to the 
necessary changes in working conditions arising from the global pandemic. They have remained focused on delivering quality investment and 
client service, with the goal of assisting our clients through the continuing global uncertainties.  We look forward to the safe and hopefully swift 
resolution of the pandemic, and in the meantime extend our hope that you and your family remain safe and well.

The global asset management industry is a highly competitive space.  Our focus is on the alternatives sector, and more specifically multi-
manager hedge funds solutions. 
Our purpose is to protect and grow our investors’ assets, and we seek to achieve this through diversification from traditional markets with 
exposure to intelligently and actively managed portfolios of hedge fund strategies. 
 
 
 
Our success depends on three key factors 
 
Assets Under Management 
We earn revenue from managing assets on behalf of our clients (which we refer to as "Assets Under 
Management" or “AUM”). 
We seek to attract and retain AUM by offering quality investment products and services, and 
delivering competitive performance and features.   
Our ability to do this can also be impacted by external factors such as global markets and investor 
sentiment.
 
 
Fee Rates 
The revenue we earn on our AUM depends on the management and performance fees we are 
entitled to charge for our services. 
Our commingled investment products pay us management and performance fees based on 
disclosed rates, whilst our institutional clients can negotiate fees with us. 
We operate in a highly competitive market, and there is pressure from investors to negotiate 
lower fee rates across the global investment management industry. 
 
People 
Our success relies on attracting and retaining talented employees. 
It is our employees who use their skills and knowledge to enable us to provide quality investment 
products and services, to innovate to meet changing investor needs and to respond to compliance 
requirements in what is a highly regulated industry.   
To attract, motivate and retain quality employees NGI needs to offer competitive compensation 
and incentive packages. 
 
Annual Report 2020 | Operating & financial review    7 
 
Our solutions 
The foundation for all of our services is our proprietary managed accounts program.  Entrepreneurial and innovative, Lighthouse has since its 
inception employed proprietary managed accounts. We believe this has allowed us to build truly differentiated alternative asset portfolios with 
idiosyncratic exposures, and it spurs our continuing evolution. 
Lighthouse invests in portfolios of actively managed hedge funds that seek to diversify traditional market exposures. Our objective is to create 
and deliver innovative investment solutions that safely compound investor capital. 
Each managed account is typically owned by at least one Lighthouse fund and is managed by a Lighthouse entity. Hedge fund managers are 
authorised by Lighthouse to trade the assets within each managed account in accordance with defined investment guidelines and parameters. 
Lighthouse investors can place their assets in commingled funds or in customised solutions. We typically structure all our hedge fund allocations 
within our proprietary managed account framework. 
 
 
Commingled Funds 
Lighthouse manages a number of multi-strategy and strategy-focused funds.  The funds utilise 
Lighthouse's proprietary managed accounts which own and control the assets and liabilities, and 
authorise external fund managers to trade the assets within certain guidelines. 
The two largest strategies for the commingled funds are: 
  Diversified – which is a multi-strategy, absolute return strategy with low correlation and beta to 
traditional markets.  
  Global Long/Short – which is a global long/short equity fund seeking equity-like returns with 
lower volatility than traditional global equity investments. 
 
 
Customised Solutions 
Customised solutions offers investors who are able to commit to a significant investment size 
the ability to access the benefits of the managed account structure in their own customised 
portfolio while still receiving portfolios construction, manager selection and due diligence 
services from the Lighthouse investment team.  
Lighthouse is able to work closely with large strategic investors to customise their alternative 
investment exposure and meet specific needs across middle office, risk monitoring and 
investment advisory services.  
 
Platform Services 
Platform services provides clients who have significant allocations to hedge fund assets to access 
the benefits of a managed account structure while maintaining control of manager selection and 
allocation decisions. 
We offer our clients a unique skill set and knowledge which allows us to provide clients with efficient 
onboarding, specialised legal structuring and compliance services, counterparty management and 
robust operational oversight. Our internally built expertise also means we can offer a high level of 
customisation, and support purpose-built tools for advanced portfolio analytics, risk management and 
treasury functionality. 
Lighthouse has built its infrastructure over time to handle the complexity of operating a large account 
program in terms of number of managers and assets under management.

14    Annual Report 2020 | Operating & financial review 
Information and technology expenses 
There has been a $91 thousand or 3% decrease in information 
and technology expenses.   
An additional $1.1 million of spend has been incurred in the current 
year in relation to the development and testing of a new proprietary 
trading platform. As noted above, only a portion of costs will be on-
going once the platform is fully operational. 
This has been offset by a $1.3 million decrease in costs for the 
MAS business.  The prior year included additional technology 
expenses for the transition of MAS data, systems and staff, of 
which only $142 thousand are on-going and incurred in the current 
year. 
Distribution expense 
Distribution expense relates to third party distribution 
arrangements, whereby ongoing payments are made to third 
parties in relation to clients they have introduced and who continue 
to be invested in Group portfolios.  Distribution expense does not 
include rebates on management fees paid to clients, as these are 
off-set directly against management fee revenue. 
The distribution expense for this financial year was $2.8 million 
(2019: $3.4 million).  This reduction is largely due to the reduction 
in Commingled fund AUM over the year, and at present represents 
3.2% of revenue (30 June 2019: 3.2%). 
Impairment loss 
The impairment loss relates to the full write-down of the intangible 
asset related to the acquisition of client relationships from Mesirow 
Advanced Strategies on 1 July 2018.  The MAS AUM have seen a 
75% reduction since acquisition date, with the remaining AUM 
operationally absorbed into Lighthouse. As a result, the $0.8 
million intangible balance has been written down to $nil. 
Income tax expense 
The Group recognises an accounting tax expense in its income 
statement at an effective tax rate of 29.9% (2019: 26.1%). The 
effective tax rate reflects a combination of the United States 
federal tax rate of 21%, individual United States state-based taxes, 
as well as the effect of other permanent and temporary tax 
adjustments. 
The Group has significant tax losses available to off-set its tax 
liabilities, and hence there is no tax payable in relation to this 
accounting tax expense other than in relation to some relatively 
nominal United States state-based taxes.

a higher than expected contraction to AUM. 
 
Business and economic factors  As investment management is the Group’s core operations, business and economic factors have 
had the largest impact on our business. 
The extreme volatility of global markets in March led to some disappointing investment 
performance in our multi-strategy funds, which resulted in significant losses to the market value 
of assets we manage across our portfolios.  Whilst investment returns of the multi-strategy 
portfolios have regained ground since March 2020, we consider that there is some risk that 
clients will opt to reduce their exposure to these multi-strategy portfolios over the next 12 
months. 
In contrast, our equity portfolios performed well during this period, and we consider this may in 
fact create some opportunities to attract new clients into these strategies in future. 
Amounts receivable from external  The majority of our revenue is earned from products managed by the Group, and we have 
parties  historically had a very low default rate in relation to our trade and other receivables.  The 
pandemic has not had any impact on the expectation that all of the Group’s trade and other 
receivables will be received in accordance with normal trading terms. 
The nature of the Group’s operations means that it is not dependant on supply chains for

    Key service providers have been able to continue to provide services to the Group without

Exposures to overseas operations,  The Group’s functional currency is USD and the majority of its assets, liabilities, revenues and 
transactions and currencies  expenses are denominated in USD.  Whilst there was significant volatility in the AUD:USD 
exchange rate at the beginning of the pandemic, it has not resulted in any material losses to the 
Group. 
Containment measures  The Group has been very fortunate that we have been able to shift to a work-from-home model 
with minimal disruptions.  The Group has and will continue to adhere to all local health, social 
distancing and travel advice/guidelines.  Changes have been implemented as necessary, 
including:
   elimination of non-essential travel; 
  restriction of access to our office premises in accordance with local guidelines; and 
  utilisation of digital technologies, particularly for online collaboration and meetings. 
Although the duration of the pandemic is still an unknown, it is not expected that these changes 
will be permanent in any way that would be detrimental to future operations. 
Government support and assistance  The Group has not applied for any government or other support or assistance. 
Cash flow management  Whilst we have seen a reduction in AUM and hence revenue, the Group has not experienced 
any cash flow issues, and expects to be able to appropriately manage its cash flow in both the 
short and long term. 
Debt and lease contracts  The Group has renewed its existing $15 million Credit Facility for a further two years until 27 July 
2022. 
There has not been any modifications to our existing leases.  Unrelated to the pandemic, the 
Group had a significant reduction to headcount in its Chicago office in November 2019 and has 
entered into an arrangement to sub-lease this office during the 2021 calendar year.

Overview of remuneration policy and approach 
 
The overall objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies are to: 
  embed a culture that promotes the Group’s core values 
  support the business strategy of the Group by attracting, retaining and rewarding quality staff 
  encourage appropriate performance and results to uphold client and shareholder interests 
  properly reflect each individual’s duties and responsibilities 
 
When setting the Group’s approach to remuneration, the Board keeps three key factors front-of-mind: 
 
Operations are based in the US 
Navigator is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, however the Group’s operations are 
predominantly based in the United States.  To be effective in attracting and retaining high quality staff, remuneration 
arrangements must therefore be aligned to the expectations of people who are employed in the United States 
alternative asset management industry. 
These remuneration arrangements may diverge from arrangements which would be considered industry practice within 
Australia.  The quantum and proportion of variable remuneration to total remuneration packages is one such area. 
 
 
Variable remuneration is a major component 
The remuneration arrangements in place for Lighthouse are structured around setting a relatively low fixed 
remuneration amount, and having the opportunity to earn variable remuneration as a major component of overall 
remuneration.  This is particularly true for our United States based senior management.  The Board believes this 
provides a dynamic basis to be able to adjust the Group’s total remuneration expense, and is also consistent with 
United States industry practice. 
This approach to remuneration has been in place at Lighthouse since prior to its acquisition in January 2008.  The 
Lighthouse senior executives have each earned a $250,000 base salary since that time, and this has not been 
increased in over 12 years.  In addition, select Lighthouse senior executives have had bonus entitlements specified in 
their employment contracts since Lighthouse joined the Navigator Group, and these contractual arrangements remain in 
place (see page 30 for additional details). 
 
 
Simplicity 
A simple, direct metric for setting annual variable remuneration provides an incentive structure that is easily 
understandable to both staff and shareholders.  An increase in operating results therefore translates into both an 
increase in the available bonus pool for Lighthouse staff and a higher dividend payment for shareholders. 
This simplicity also extends to the Board exercising its discretion in setting the total amount of variable compensation, 
as well as the CEO being able to exercise discretion in allocating bonuses to individuals based on their performance 
and contribution.  Whilst individual results are important, we also encourage a culture which is able to reward effort, 
ethical behaviour and commitment outside of formulaic metrics. 
The Board is satisfied that the current arrangements are consistent with alternative asset management industry practice 
in the United States, and allow employees to focus on achieving results for clients, which is ultimately in the long-term 
interests of shareholders.

 Long term incentive arrangements   
The Group does not currently have any equity incentive schemes or   
other long-term incentive arrangements in place. 
 
The Board acknowledges that an equity incentive scheme is a 
 
common component of corporate remuneration structures, and 
regularly reviews whether the implementation of equity incentive   
arrangements for senior employees would be an appropriate 
 
addition to the Group’s remuneration structure. 
 
 
 
Other benefits 
 
Lighthouse employees are entitled to additional benefits that may 
include educational assistance, adoption assistance and health   
care benefits.    
Lighthouse employees are also able to make investments into   
Lighthouse managed funds without incurring a management fee.  
 
There is no incremental cost incurred by the Group in providing fee-
free investment management services via the Lighthouse funds to   
employees.  Having employees invest their own assets into 
 
Lighthouse managed funds is viewed positively by clients and 
potential clients as it demonstrates an alignment of interest between   
the Lighthouse employee and future investment results for clients.  
 
Nil fee arrangements for employees is common practice in the 
United States asset management industry.

Relationship between remuneration policy and company performance 
In implementing the remuneration policy and structure, the Board has had regard to what it considers to be the key measure  
of the profitability of the Company:  
 
EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation from continuing operations.  
 
As an asset management business, the Group’s EBITDA is largely consistent with the cash flow which it generates from its operating activities, 
and which is available to pay dividends to shareholders.  It is for this reason that NGI’s dividend policy has been set as a pay-out ratio based on 
EBITDA. 
The following table shows how cash bonuses paid to key management personnel compares to EBITDA and cash flows from operating activities 
over the past 5 years: 
  US$’000

 Variable compensation for the 2020 financial year 
The Board has established a simple, direct methodology for balancing how we reward staff and deliver value to shareholders  
through company financial performance. The two metrics which are used to create annual variable remuneration pools are: 
  Company performance metric  Basis of variable remuneration 
Lighthouse EBITDA   30% allocated to Lighthouse general 
Lighthouse general pool  (excluding performance fees, before bonuses  bonus pool 
and adjusted for other specified items) 
50% allocated to Lighthouse incentive fee 
Lighthouse incentive fee pool  Performance fees  bonus pool 
The Board retains the discretion to vary the final amounts approved after calculation based on the above pools, to ensure that they can also factor 
in extenuating circumstances. 
Allocation of bonuses for the 2020 financial year took into account the 2 very different investment results experienced by the Group’s equity 
portfolios compared to the Group’s multi-strategy portfolios through the extremely volatile global market conditions arising under the COVID-19 
pandemic, particularly in March 2020: 
  the strong performance of the Lighthouse equity portfolios; 
  the under-performance of the Lighthouse multi-strategy portfolios, particularly in March 2020.

Given Mr McGould’s low base salary, his variable remuneration is 
not capped as a % of base salary, as is commonly the case in 
Australia.  Instead, the CEO’s bonus is capped at a maximum of 
10% of the Lighthouse general bonus pool.  In practice, this means 
that Mr McGould’s variable remuneration is constrained by the 
profitability of the Group’s operating business unit.   
Mr McGould received a bonus of $400,000 for the year ended 30 
June 2020.  The significant reduction on his prior year bonus (even 
after adjusting for the 18 months of bonus paid to 30 June 2019 
per page 29) is in acknowledgement of the underperformance of 
the Lighthouse multi-strategy portfolios in March 2020, as well as 
the generally negative impacts expected on the Group’s operating 
performance due to the impacts of this negative performance on 
assets under management.

Since its acquisition in 2008 the Lighthouse bonus cycle was based on calendar years, and accordingly bonuses were generally paid in December

bonuses for Lighthouse staff were determined and paid for the six months to 30 June 2019. This resulted in 18 months of bonus being paid for the 
period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.

controls the good or service until it subsequently directs the good   
or service to be transferred to the fund.  
As the Group controls the good or service before it is transferred, 
the Group is not acting in a capacity as agent for the fund.  The 
Group is required to recognise both: 
  the expense incurred under the contract with the third-party 
service providers (see note 3) to receive the good or service; 
and 
  the revenue to which it expects to be entitled from the fund in 
exchange for transferring the good or service. 
The revenue and expense in relation to these reimbursed costs 
directly off-set as the Group does not add a margin to the original 
cost of the good or service transferred to the fund. 
Revenue from the provision of office space and 
services 
The Group has a number of agreements with external parties to 
license office space at its New York and London offices. As part of 
these agreements, licensees are charged license fees and service 
charges on a monthly basis. 
The Group has two obligations in relation to these agreements: 
  to provide office space to licensees, including services in 
connection with licensees’ use and occupancy of the office 
space; and 
  to provide other on-going business services. 
The Group’s obligation to provide office space services and its 
obligation to provide business services to licensees are satisfied 
as and when the customer receives and consumes the services on 
a continuous basis.  The Group recognises revenue as the amount 
to which it has a right to invoice for the period. 
The Group is entitled to: 
  a license fee and an occupancy-related service charge as per 
the terms of the applicable contract with each licensee as it 
satisfies its obligations to provide office space and related 
services; and 
  a service charge as per the terms of the applicable contract 
with each licensee as it satisfies its obligations to provide 
business services.

Due to the short-term nature of the Group’s trade receivables and 
the historically low default rate on payment by customers, there is   
no credit allowance against trade receivables as at 30 June 2020 
 
or 30 June 2019.  In determining this credit allowance, the Group 
has considered forward looking factors specific to the receivables 
and the economic environment and determined that any allowance 
would be insignificant.

The ‘Other’ column includes the effect of reclassification of non-current portion of lease liabilities to current due to the passage of time. The 
Group classifies interest paid as cash flows from operating activities. 
Lease payments have been discounted using the following incremental borrowing rates: 
Office premises:    3.23% to 4.36% 
The Group discounts lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate as of 1 July 2019 or the date of entering into a new lease. 
Incremental borrowing rates are determined for each lease based on its maturity profile. The rates for US based leases were determined in 
reference to the 1 month USD Swap Monthly Money rate to effectively swap the Group’s current Line of Credit borrowing rate (1 month USD 
LIBOR) to a fixed longer term borrowing. For non-US based leases, comparable country specific reference rates were selected. All rates were 
supplemented by a margin to reflect a leasing risk premium.

Fair value of financial instruments  
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the subjectivity of the inputs used in making the 
measurements.  The different levels of fair value hierarchy are: 
  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) 
  Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
Fair value measurements

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Navigator Global 
Investments Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Report 
Opinion 
We have audited the financial report of Navigator Global Investment Limited (the Company) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 
2020, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity 
and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies, and the directors' declaration. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations 
Act 2001, including: 
a) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June
2020 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and
b) complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor 
independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the 
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
the Code.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit 
included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the 
procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying financial report.

Information Other than the Financial Report and Auditor’s Report Thereon 
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s 2020 Annual Report, but does not include the financial report 
and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report 
and our related assurance opinion.   
In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. 
As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
A  member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 
L iability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation 
82
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions 
taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. 
From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the Audit of the Remuneration Report 
Opinion on the Remuneration Report 
We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors' report for the year ended 30 
June 2020. 
In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Navigator Global Investments Limited for the year ended 
30 June 2020, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. 
Responsibilities 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the 
Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
