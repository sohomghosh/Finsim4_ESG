The Siamese fighting fish is a small and colourful carnivorous species
of fish found in the Mekong River and will directly benefit from the
moratorium of dam construction in Cambodia. More details on this

An introduction from

2020 was certainly a year none of us
will soon forget. The COVID-19
pandemic had an unparalleled

Environmental regeneration
SUMMARY
Aurum focuses on regeneration rather than carbon offsetting.
Project Regeneration avoids the shortcomings of some of the traditional carbon offsetting
schemes such as:
• Carbon credits that are purchased for schemes of low-quality impact
• A lack of assessment of schemes that leaves room for error or fraud
• The failure to protect diverse species and eco-systems; and the assumption that trees planted
are left in the ground until their death
Project Regeneration is more than a box ticking scheme, the project offers users the option to
select from a portfolio of pre-vetted non-governmental organisations that engage in
environmental conservation and are subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation. This provides
a scalable solution to offsetting Aurum’s carbon footprint while enhancing biodiversity that can
be adopted by anyone looking to engage in environmental philanthropy.

Strategic conservation | IUCN
SUMMARY
Aurum supports IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). Created in 1948, IUCN has
evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. The IUCN harnesses the
experience, resources and reach of its 1,400+ Member organisations and the input of some 16,000
experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed
to safeguard it. IUCN provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the
knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature
conservation to take place together. IUCN has the ability to convene diverse stakeholders and
provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise, driving its
mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. The IUCN also serves as an
official agency monitoring progress towards biodiversity-related targets.

Driving change | Mobilising the hedge fund industry
SUMMARY
The hedge fund industry deals with complexity and risk every day. Fundamental to the industry’s
success are analysis of data and the need to understand the impact of trends and systemic
change. By extending this approach to environmental impact, the industry is ideally placed to
both understand the problems and be part of the solution.
