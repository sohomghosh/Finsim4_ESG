BNP Paribas contributes to the protection of biodiversity
BNP Paribas has published a public position on biodiversity including criteria on 
deforestation aiming at assessing soy and beef producers and negotiators
• Strategy aiming at zero deforestation by 2025
• Full traceability of channels by 2025 and exclusion of suppliers not in line with the target
• No beef or soya on processed areas: Amazon after 2008, Cerrado after early 2020
BNP Paribas strengthens its commitments to preserving biodiversity in the context of 
the act4nature initiative of the EpE association, including :
• Evaluation of all its corporate customers on criteria linked to biodiversity by 2025
• €3 billion target for funding related to the protection of terrestrial biodiversity and €1 
billion target for funding related to the ecological transition of ships by 2025 
• €250 million invested in start-ups mobilised for ecological transition and €55 million 
dedicated to protecting and restoring natural capital
BNP Paribas has been working on the informal working group set up to pre-figure the 
work of the TNFD*, helping to set the stage, as one of the co-chairs
CEO of BNP Paribas, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, said: 
“Collective action is needed to help protect our natural ecosystems and stop their degradation. BNP 
Paribas has already taken commitments to preserve biodiversity, but common and applicable standards 
are needed to leverage the power of finance for nature. The TNFD is key in convening market participants 
towards such standards.”

On May 15th, 2020, BNP Paribas published its renewed Group Code of Tax
Conduct, which defines the Tax principles and procedures applicable to

allows to share it with all BNP Paribas’ stakeholders.
