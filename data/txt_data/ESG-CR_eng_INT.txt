NAM’s strategy on climate change includes climate-focused 
product development, climate-related divestment policies, and 
the integration of climate risk management into the investment 
process. Climate is a focus area for our engagement with the 
companies in which we invest. We view this as both part of our 
fiduciary duty and a means by which we can help meet the 
goals of the Paris Agreement.

1 . Climate governance 5
1. Climate governance
At NAM, the commitment to climate-resilient investments comes from the top. The Board 
oversees the strategic direction and reviews the development of our ESG and climate policies, 
starting from the Responsible Investment Committee (RIC) charter and Chief Investment Officer 
(CIO) instructions, through to the Responsible Investment policy and the Corporate Governance 
policy. The Board has approved the Responsible Investment (RI) strategy and the climate 
strategy, and is updated at least annually on their implementation. The entire Board has received 
training in ESG, including climate topics.

related to technological developments, as well as liability risks.
2. Physical risks, which relate to impacts resulting from cli-
mate change, can result from adverse extreme weather events 
(acute risks) or long-term shifts in climate patterns (chronic 
risks). Physical risks may have both direct financial implications 
for organizations, due to damage to assets, and indirect im-
pacts from supply chain disruptions and variations in resource 
availability.
Of these two risk types, transition risk is likely to have a more 
imminent and abrupt impact on our investments. The climate 
commitments that the signatories to the Paris Agreement have 
so far made to address global warming are widely understood 
to be insufficient for limiting temperature increases to below 
2°C, and we expect that many countries will introduce stricter 
climate regulations in the near term, exposing economies to 
heightened transition risk. Recent increases in the climate am-
bition levels by the EU and China will likely be followed by 
similar moves also by other countries.
However, as well as bringing risks, it is clear that the low-car-
bon transition brings investment opportunities, and particu-
larly technology-oriented opportunities for companies that pro-
vide innovative products and services that will aid the transi-
tion to a low-carbon and high-efficiency future. In addition to 
measuring our climate risk exposure, we therefore also need to 
measure our exposure to the ‘climate solutions’ that help drive 
the transition, such as renewable energy, low-carbon buildings, 
and energy efficiency technologies. Many of these opportuni-
ties are materialising already today.

enues from coal production from all its portfolios, and applies our Paris-Aligned Fossil Fuel (PAFF) policy or even stricter exclusion criteria to all portfolios designated ESG (currently app. 30%

be subject to significant fluctuations which may affect the value of an investment. Investments in Emerging Markets involve a higher element of risk. The value of the investment 
can greatly fluctuate and cannot be ensured. Investments in equity and debt instruments issued by banks could bear the risk of being subject to the bail-in mechanism (meaning 
that equity and debt instruments could be written down in order to ensure that most unsecured creditors of an institution bear appropriate losses) as foreseen in EU Directive 
2014/59/EU. For further details of investment risks associated with these sub-funds, please refer to the relevant Key Investor Information Document, as applicable, available as 
described above. Nordea Asset Management has decided to bear the cost for research, i.e. such cost is covered by existing fee arrangements (Management-/Administration-Fee).
