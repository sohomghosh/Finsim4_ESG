economic activities will be stagnant for a long time. We would like to express our heartfelt 
sympathy to those who have been infected and their families, and to all those whose lives 
and business activities have been severely disrupted by COVID-19.
In addition, regarding the issue of forward processing in the tallying operations of exer-
cised voting rights which came to light in September 2020, we would like to express our 
sincere apologies once again for causing great inconvenience and concern to all companies 
that have entrusted the provision of stock transfer agency services business to SuMi Trust 
Bank, Tokyo Securities Transfer Agent and JAPAN SECURITIES AGENTS, as well as to all 
shareholders and capital market participants.
We have defined our Purpose (reason for existence) as “To create new value with the 
power of trusts and let prosperous future for our clients and society bloom,” and have 
launched a Medium-Term Management Plan that places the “balanced creation of both 
social value and economic value” as a core management philosophy. By steadily advancing 
initiatives to solve a variety of social issues in the Group’s wide-ranging business domains, 
we aim to achieve sustainable development of society as well as sustainable and stable 
growth for the Group.
Looking at the macroeconomic environment, the concept of “Build Back Better” is being 
advocated to realize a stronger economy going forward compared to pre-COVID times 
based on lessons learned from the Global Financial Crisis. In Europe, enormous sums are 
being allocated on accelerating the climate-neutral Green Deal policy initiative to make it 
a pillar for economic recovery. Even in Japan, which has been lagging behind, a change in 
government policy is expected to lead to a strong push for monetary policies that promote 
environmental innovation. As a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), 
which calls for conformity with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), we will also play our expected roles in realizing a carbon-free society by promoting 
S
innovation of or facilitating the transition to renewable energy, hydrogen, next-generation  u
m
storage batteries, and carbon recycling. ito
m
In addition to raising concerns about climate change, the spread of COVID-19 has also  o
highlighted the importance of human capital. I feel that it is the mission of top manage-  M
its
ment to create a workplace where the people responsible for executing the Medium-Term  u
i T
Management Plan and supporting the sustainable growth of the Group can safely take on  ru
s
the challenge of figuring out new ways to work under the new normal environment and  t H

contribute to improving performance. In March 2020, the Company was selected for the  ld
first time as one of the Nadeshiko Brand enterprises by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and  ing

diversity is not just about gender. We are determined to further strengthen our initiatives to

Precisely because we are in this challenging environment, we will strive to become a com-

Response to the Spread of COVID-19
The Group has been focusing on supporting various stakeholders in the prolonged efforts to combat the COVID-19 pan-
demic. To continue providing services in an unprecedented situation as a financial group specialized in trust banking, we 
will continue to take action based on three basic stances: ensuring the health and safety of employees and their families, 
ensuring business continuity as a key piece of social infrastructure, and preventing the spread of infection in society (includ-
ing activities to create a society that is less prone to the spread of infection).
As a financial institution that plays an important role in social infrastructure, we will continue to ensure the stable con-
tinuation of business operations while maintaining the safety, security, and health of our clients and employees as our 
top priority.

In response to client comments such as, “I need to go to  seminars online and installing acrylic panels to prevent

In the situation where donation-related malicious scams were rampant, we received many comments from our clients saying they 
felt comfortable donating because the donation activities were carried out by the SuMi TRUST Group and that they were happy 
to be able to contribute to society in this way. This gave us an opportunity to reaffirm the strength of everyone’s determination 
to help society.
While carrying out each activity, we also focused on raising client awareness by holding press conferences with the universities 
we supported and lobby exhibitions at branches located near the universities. As a result, some clients made donations after 
visiting the lobby exhibitions, and others commented that they were happy to help because their favorite regions and universities 
were the recipients of the donations.

Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2020–2022)
We formulated the three-year strategy after reassessing the roles and functions expected of us as a financial group spe-
cialized in trust banking, as well as our own reason for existence (Purpose) based on a long-term perspective.
In the previous Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2017-2019), we implemented our business model transformation to 
meet the diversifying needs of our clients, and in the Medium-Term Management Plan starting in fiscal 2020, we will further 
promote these initiatives and proactively address the social issues that arise for individuals, corporations, and investors, 
positioning the next three years as a time to solidify the foundation for the Group’s sustainable and stable growth.

We think the diversification of values in society and the growing number of uncertainties in the environment suggest that 
now is the right time for the SuMi TRUST Group to take on the mantle of providing trust schemes that can help achieve a 
safe and secure society. As the “Best Partner” most trusted by our clients, we intend to do everything we possibly can to 
pass on to the next generation a society that is even more capable of coping with change.

a destruction of nature. Since the industrial revolution, humans have become extremely prosperous, but in

ment, which started with asset management in 2006, has become mainstream in capital markets. Further, the 
Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), launched in 2019, is aimed at playing a proactive role in improving 
the effectiveness of ESG by focusing on the concept of “Impact,” which is the pursuit of both economic and 
social returns.
We at SuMi TRUST Bank have been boldly taking up the challenge that comes with these changes in the 
environment as an opportunity. First, regarding the concept of “Impact,” in March 2019 we became the first 
company in the world to offer operating companies Positive Impact Finance (PIF) solutions that do not specify 
the use of funds. In March 2020, we became the first financial institution in Asia to sign the Poseidon Principles, 
which is an initiative led by financial institutions to address climate change risks in the shipping industry. In 
addition, we have substantially strengthened our sustainability management consulting services by leveraging 
the Group’s practical know-how, which has been very well received by our clients.
The Japanese government’s Carbon Neutral Declaration has completely shifted the mood of the business 
world. I feel that the areas where trusts can demonstrate their strengths have expanded even further. We will con-
tinue to take the lead in promoting sustainable finance and do our absolute best to build a sustainable society.

Sustainability Promotion System
In our Medium-Term Management Plan, we have incorporated a basic strategy for generating positive impacts geared 
towards solving social issues and have placed sustainability at the core of the Group’s management. Each SuMi TRUST Bank 
business and its affiliated companies will independently select the social issues that must be addressed first, and we will 
strengthen efforts on these issues through our core business. Meanwhile, for climate change and other key sustainability 
issues in Japan and overseas, our Sustainability Promotion Committee functions as a command center for the entire Group 
and formulates strategies to swiftly implement initiatives whilst collaborating with mainly international organizations.

5. Multi-Stakeholder Partnership
Goal 17 of the SDGs promotes a diverse range of partnerships. Given the vital role of finance in the for-
mation of a sustainable society, the Group places a strong emphasis on taking action, in partnership with 
various stakeholders, including other financial institutions, to tackle solutions to difficult challenges. We 
participate actively in partnerships within Japan and overseas.
Principles for Financial Action for the 21st Century towards a Sustainable Society  
(The Principles for Financial Action towards the formation of a sustainable society)
We, together with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management (SMTAM), Nikko Asset Management (NAM) and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust 
Panasonic Finance, support the aims of the Principles for Financial Action for the 21st Century (PFA21), an effort in which over 280  S
u
financial institutions of all types collaborate towards the formation of a sustainable society. We have had a central role in this work since  m
the Principles were drafted in 2011. Moreover, since 2013 we have been a member of the Financial Principles Steering Committee (the  ito
m
“Steering Committee”), and served as chair of the Sustainable Community Support Working Group (WG), which practices outreach and  o
 M
education in sustainable finance in regional areas. In FY2020, this WG has been holding a series of online seminars entitled “What is a  its
Regional Circulation Symbiotic Sphere?” under the theme of “Considering the Role of Financial Institutions in Regions” jointly with the  ui T
Bank Deposit, Lending, and Leasing WG. ru

addressed at Sustainability Promotion Committee in our Executive Committee, etc., to reconsider the policies as well as 
make improvements to our operations as necessary.
4. Education and Training
As a member of a responsible trust bank group, to ensure that SuMi TRUST Bank’s directors and employees deepen their 
understanding of ways to reduce environmental impact, policies for human rights, and sector policies, the Bank continually 
conducts educational training. The company also spares no effort to ensure that directors and employees comply with all 
relevant regulations and procedures.
5. Communication with Stakeholders
SuMi TRUST Bank continues to engage in dialogues and collaborations with various stakeholders on themes that are rele-

The Group’s Approach to Planet (Environmental Issues) People
Prosperity
With regard to the three elements of a sustainable society, namely the economy, society, and the environment, the spread 
of COVID-19 demonstrated how social dysfunction can cause immeasurable damage to the economy, while also highlight-
ing how global environmental issues such as climate change can undermine the very foundation of society’s existence. This 
implies that an economy can function only in a healthy society, and that society must stay within the limits of the environ-
ment. Based on this perspective, we have established an environmental policy that considers global environmental issues 
in relation to the economy, and we are accelerating our various environmental initiatives.

Natural Capital (Biodiversity Issues)
The global environment is the foundation for sustaining the life of various living creatures. It comprises of natural capital, 
such as water, air, soil, as well as marine and terrestrial fauna and flora that are grown in such resources under the blessings 
of the sun. Humans also depend on natural capital and have utilized it to build social systems and develop the economy. In 
this process, however, humans have also caused significant consequences.
Natural capital is not inexhaustible. Supplies may be exhausted sooner or later unless we accurately track and manage 
our dependence and impacts on natural capital. This is closely interlinked with humans’ day-to-day activities. For this rea-
son, all SDGs are connected with natural capital. Primarily from the perspective of corporate activities, the Group focuses 
on natural capital in Japan, where we lay our business foundation, as well as natural capital outside Japan, where we rely on 
highly for the procurement of raw materials and parts. We have selected goals that contribute to proper dependence on 
and management of such natural capital.

Natural Capital Evaluation
Natural capital evaluation is a service that calculates natural capital dependence arising from corporate activities and esti-
mates the degree of impact for each procured item and for each country and region, tracing back through supply chain.

Discussions with the Brazilian government and the Central Bank of Brazil on 
the development and management of rainforests in the Amazon basin
In June 2020, as part of the activities of the Forest Conservation Engagement Working Group of the PRI (Principles for Responsible 
Investment), to which asset management company Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management (SMTAM) is a signatory, and CERES, 
an environmental NGO, we submitted an open letter to the Brazilian government requesting that it effectively disclose information 
on the conservation and management of the Amazon forest and its development status, and began engagement activities with the 
Brazilian government. As an asset manager, SuMi TRUST Asset Management is the only company in Japan that has supported the 
project from the beginning, and is working as one of the lead managers of the project. In July 2020, we held a total of four meetings 
with the Vice President of Brazil and the Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil. In addition to the meetings held through the working 
group, we also had individual discussions with the Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil as well as the Brazilian Ambassador to Japan. 
At this meeting, SuMi TRUST Asset Management President Hishida conveyed our unique approach, which differs from European 
companies that have suggested the possibility of suspending investments and loans, and we had a meaningful exchange of opinions

The amount of CO2 emitted from the construction and operation of buildings is said to account for approximately 40% 
of all CO2 emissions in Japan, including indirect emissions. In addition, as humans spend a long time indoors, the indoor 
environment affects the health and productivity of the occupants. Given the significant impact of real estate property on 
the three aspects of the environment, society, and the economy, integrated initiatives for achieving the SDGs are thought 
to be highly beneficial for improving the sustainability of the three aspects.
The Group aims to promote and increase properties that give consideration to the environment, such as cities and 
buildings with high energy and resource efficiency and buildings that contribute to improving production efficiency. We will 
advance initiatives that contribute to increasing property values through features such as high environmental performance 
that reduce risk and enhance income.

HIROSHIMA ORIZURU TOWER
Situated adjacent to the Atomic Bomb Dome (Hiroshima Peace Memorial), this office build-
ing underwent full-scale renovations. The existing framework was reused and the building 
enlarged to accommodate a higher level of earthquake resistance. A large canopy, louvers, 
and a “spiral slope” walking ramp were also built into the newly expanded sections. The 
building reduces its CO2 footprint by utilizing various energy-saving features, including 
solar shading and cross ventilation. Visitors to the building can access the HIROSHIMA 
HILL observation deck under the giant canopy on the roof, enjoy numerous activities in 
ORIZURU Square, and learn about its CO2 reduction initiatives.
The ORIZURU TOWER was selected for the MLIT’s leading projects program for promot-
ing CO2 reduction in housing and buildings.

SuMi TRUST Bank is participating in various ways, such as design-

values) and creating project-specific product plans for environmentally 
friendly housing loans.
This project is also praised for its community-wide comprehensive 
CO2 reduction efforts together with town management. It was selected 
for subsidies under the MLIT-led “leading projects” program for sus-

The Chofu Building and Meguro Building were excluded from these results starting in fiscal year 2017. 
The mandatory reduction ratio is 6% for the head office and 17% for other buildings. 
The head office is a multi-tenant building and reduction ratios for each tenant have not been set. 
The Group carried over emission credits (from excess emission reductions in the first plan period) worth 47,540 t-CO2 to the second plan period. 
Emissions have been verified by a third-party assessment body.

Prosperity
The sustainable society envisioned under the SDGs is based on the assumption that humans will play a central role. Thus, 
the 17 goals ultimately aim to achieve human happiness. In 1948 the World Health Organization (WHO) described the state 
of human happiness as “well-being” (a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being) and the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has defined the conditions of well-being to be comprised of material 
components such as income, employment, and housing, as well as immaterial components that contribute to quality of 
life (QOL), including health, education, and social connections. Our initiatives on pursuing prosperity and those related 
to global environmental considerations are also sorted into those that create positive impacts that ultimately lead to the 
well-being of people from all walks of life, not just our clients and employees.

A Motivating, Fulfilling Work Culture
To “provide all employees with motivating opportunities to 
succeed and grow,” we endeavor to build a work culture 
that encourages employees to challenge themselves and 
learn, and stimulate mutual communication.
Managers are expected to meet with their employees at 
least quarterly. These meetings allow the manager to get to 
know the employees’ day-to-day concerns and challenges, 
help them grow and contribute in a timely manner, and think 
through their career plans together.
As previously mentioned, we have recommended employ-
ees enlist their colleagues beyond each branch or depart-
ment to create such learning opportunities as seminars 
and learning circles, and hosted lectures inviting outside 
Su lecturers on a regular basis. In addition, SuMi TRUST Bank  Next-generation leaders discuss the Group’s mission during training

The above-mentioned policy also applies to our overseas network, and the Group gathers information on cases where the corporate 
activities of our domestic and overseas suppliers and contractors (supply chain), and companies that we invest in or lend to, negatively 
impact human rights. In cases where relevant laws, standards, and policies are violated, necessary measures are taken as appropriate.
Basic Philosophy
The Group’s human rights management is based on the“Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights,” which was adopted 
by the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2011.

*1  Human rights due diligence refers to a series of initiatives to identify actual or potential impact on human rights, resulting from the activities of the Group or related outside parties, to 
develop measures for the prevention or mitigation of such impacts, and to continuously verify and disclose the effectiveness of such measures.

gence, compliance with the Human Rights Policy, and occurrence of human rights violations.

100-Year Life Solution Department
Given the advent of an age in which more and more people will likely live to be 100 years old, SuMi TRUST Bank established 
a 100-Year Life Solution Department with the goal of providing suitable solutions to address the various issues faced by our 
individual clients.
The 100-Year Life Solution Department will aim to identify the increasingly diverse and complex needs of clients caused by 
changes in time horizons as a result of longer living and develop and successively roll out a whole host of solutions by harnessing 
the Group’s unique know-how cultivated over many years in an effort to deliver security, safety, and enjoyment to our clients.

Collaborating with COLTEM on Decision-Making Support
SuMi TRUST Bank is implementing dementia-related initiatives by collaborating with COLTEM (collaboration center of law, 
technology, and medicine for autonomy of older adults), which receives assistance from MEXT’s Japan Science and Technology 
Agency, as well as the post-graduate school of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, a leader in dementia research (in 
particular, Professor Jin Narumoto). The publication of our Guide for Dementia Friendly Financial Services in September 2017 
is one accomplishment of this initiative. We have also contributed to improving the entire financial industry’s response to 
dementia issues by taking the lead in hosting symposiums with a focus on finance and dementia. The knowledge gained from 
these alliances have greatly helped SuMi TRUST Bank develop its own products and services.
Also, the Bank has focused its efforts on improving the entire financial industry’s response to dementia issues by hosting 
a working group to discuss issues on responding to elderly clients at financial institutions. SuMi TRUST Bank also helped 
establish the Decision-Making Support Organization Japan, the succeeding organization to COLTEM, and contributed to the 
creation of the Bank Gerontologist certification exam in January 2021.

Key Point Under the Discretionary Guardianship System, a Separate Money Trust Provides 
an Extra Level of Safeguarding.
This money trust supports the discretionary guardianship system by managing the assets of its users. It safely and soundly pro-
tects assets held in the money trust because after the discretionary guardianship contract takes effect, funds can only be released 
(lump-sum payment) with the consent of the discretionary guardianship supervisor. Funds required for day-to-day living expenses 
can also be released periodically (regular fixed-amount payments), which alleviates the burden of asset management on the dis-
cretionary guardian. Until the discretionary guardianship contract comes into effect, the client or their nominated representative 
can take charge of procedures for lump-sum or regular fixed-amount payments. An authorization form signed by the client must 
be submitted each time the representative wishes to take charge of procedures on behalf of the client.

Key Point The Trust Bank Safeguards the Client’s Assets Pursuant to Instructions of the Family Court to 
Prevent Guardian Dishonesty.
This is structured so that the savings and deposits needed for day-to-day payments for a person receiving assistance under the 
legal guardianship system are managed by a guardian while money not ordinarily used is entrusted to the trust bank.
When utilizing this trust, written instructions issued by the family court in advance are required in order to withdraw the trust 
assets or cancel the trust contract. In principle, a professional guardian such as an attorney or judicial scrivener will act on behalf 
of the client to make decisions regarding the entrustment of assets, including the trust bank to which the assets are entrusted and 
the amount of trust assets, and conclude a trust contract with the trust bank pursuant to instructions of the family court.
This trust provides appropriate protection from the misuse of the client’s assets by an adult guardian.

Prosperity
In the World Economic Forum’s white paper Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism—Towards Common Metrics and Consistent 
Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation, which this report references, the following definition of “prosperity” is quoted 
from the UN Secretary-General’s Synthesis Report.
Definition of “Prosperity”
•  Economic growth, built upon decent employment, sustainable livelihoods, rising real incomes, social protection, and access to financial 
services for all people
•  Innovation and transforming business models to create shared value, including investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, 
settlements, industrialization, SMEs, energy, and technology
•  Shared prosperity and equitable growth, based on sustainable production and consumption
In other words, the idea of prosperity is not about how prosperous a company has become—it is a measure of how

Creation of Employment and Wealth
Companies are capable of creating significant economic value for employees, shareholders, and wider society through job 
creation and investing in the productive capacity of the economy. Job creation, employee retention, and investing in society 
are key to overcoming risk, like the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. These investments 
contribute to better living standards and wealth creation over the long term. As a result, strong economic prosperity drives 
a more educated workforce and higher workforce productivity, as well as greater buying power for the company’s customer 
base, which then triggers a chain reaction of economic value creation through renewed economic growth. From this point 
of view, the World Economic Forum has identified absolute number and rate of employment, economic contribution, and 
financial investment contribution as the common metrics for measuring employment and wealth creation.
1) Absolute Number and Rate of Employment 3) Financial Investment Contribution

Client-Oriented Initiatives
In recent years, financial institutions have been urged to be even more client-oriented. In the SuMi TRUST Group too, as 
a financial institution underpinned by our fiduciary spirit, we consider our client-oriented approach and fiduciary duties 
to be the most important items of materiality. Here we provide some information about the client-oriented initiatives and 
client protection management practices we undertake with the aim of being our clients’ “Best Partner.”

R&I Customer-Oriented Investment Trust Sales Company Rating
SuMi TRUST Bank Has Earned an R&I Customer-Oriented Investment Trust Sales Company Rating of “S”  
for two consecutive years.
The rating is based on R&I’s neutral third-party evaluation of banks, securities companies, and other financial enterprises 
engaged in the sale of investment trusts. The rating assesses their “customer-oriented business operations” and their policies 
and initiatives in this area. The SuMi TRUST Group will continue to pursue client-oriented initiatives and promote their adher-
ence as we strive to be a “Best Partner” whom our clients entrust with their business for many years to come.
*T he “R&I Customer-oriented Investment Trust Sales Company Rating” (“the rating”) is not a statement of fact. Rather, it represents R&I’s opinions regarding the “customer-oriented 
business operation” initiatives of companies engaged in the trust investment sales business. Though R&I uses information that it deems to be reliable when carrying out the rating, it 
does not independently verify the accuracy of this information. Furthermore, R&I, etc. does not guarantee the accuracy or integrity of this information, nor does it endorse the purchase, 
sale or holding of any specific product nor guarantee the future performance of any such product. All intellectual property rights (copyrights, etc.) and any other rights pertaining to the 
rating belong to R&I, and any reproduction or republication without permission is prohibited.

Direct and Indirect Support (Cash Conversion)
Companies directly contribute to communities through investments and various services to society, but also indirectly 
through taxes paid to help finance government services for those communities. From this point of view, the World 
Economic Forum has identified total tax paid and total social investment as the common metrics for measuring commu-

order to expand the scope our guarantee service. *A  non-recourse loan means that even if the amount of money from the sale of real-es-
tate collateral is not enough to repay the loan in full after the contract expires as a result 
of the contracting party’s death, their heir will not be requested to make any payments.
Approach to Asset Management for Clients with Dementia
Once a person loses his or her ability to make decisions because of dementia or some other reason, 
they struggle to manage their deposits and savings or stay on top of various financial agreements. 
They may also end up signing a contract for a transaction that is not in their best interests or become 
easy targets for bank-transfer scams or unscrupulous business practices.
In asset management, needless to say, protecting assets must be prioritized before anything else. 
What is required next is daily living support in order to manage money needed for day-to-day living. 
And offering support to help them communicate their intensions is also key. Even though someone 
may have dementia, what they want to do or what they want done remains the same. For this reason, 
we need to devise a way for them to communicate their intentions and ensure their wishes are fulfilled 
under a private contract while they are still capable of making decisions.
SuMi TRUST Bank offers various products and services in line with this thinking (see page 115 for details).

About UWC ISAK, the School We Support
UWC ISAK, a campus in the wilderness of Karuizawa, is a boarding-only high school that fosters changemakers who 
can play an active part in the international community. The school accepts students from 83 countries around the 
world. Of the approximately 200 students who attend the school, about 70% are overseas students. Many of the 
students are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and about 70% of the student body is on scholarships 
that do not require repayment. UWC ISAK’s greatest attraction is living in dormitories with colleagues from all over 
the world. Students from a variety of social and economic backgrounds, as well as nationalities, become keenly 
aware of each other’s viewpoints and cultures in an environment of sharing. In this environment, students grow up 
into adults who understand and respect different values and beliefs, rather than denying or rejecting them. Karuizawa campus

Support for the Children in Shanti Bhavan
The Shanti Bhavan school was established for the purpose of educating children who are the most socially 
and economically disadvantaged under the caste system, which has persisted for 2,000 years in India. All 
the summer school students from India that we support with scholarships are from Shanti Bhavan. They 
are highly interested in issues such as discrimination, poverty, and the human rights of women, and they 
strongly hope to improve their homeland. We will continue to watch after these future changemakers as 
they take action to abolish the caste system. A vicious cycle of despair for

SUMI TRUST GROUP INITIATIVES 02
Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Project
Based on the thinking that providing value to the community represents a social license to operate, the SuMi 
TRUST Group integrates SDG viewpoints into the array of social and regional contribution initiatives we under-
take in the communities where we have an office presence. Our policy going forward will be to engage in the 
very business of addressing the SDGs and strengthen our initiatives so that we can constantly maintain a sound 
business foundation.

Promotion of Food Drive Activities
Nanba-Chuo Branch
The world’s volume of staple food to developing countries is 390 tons, while Japan’s volume of food waste is 6.43 Mtons, 
around 1.6 times as much. Enough still-edible food to fill 1,760 trucks is thrown away every day, and food loss has become a 
major social problem.
Keen to take action in “Osaka - the town bursting with food,” our Nanba and Nanba-
Chuo branches are focusing their efforts on food drives (activities to encourage house-
holds to donate their surplus food at their workplaces and elsewhere, for donation to local 
welfare groups and facilities). The branches organize lobby presentations to convey the 
current food loss situation and details of their food drives, and encourage their customers 
to join in as branch employees regularly make donations. The donated food items are 
channeled through Food Bank Kansai and Pal Coop Children’s Food Bank, which run food 
drives. The recipients are local children’s canteens and welfare groups and facilities. Making the donation

The Sumitomo Foundation
Partnership with the Sumitomo Foundation
The Besshi Copper Mine in Ehime Prefecture was opened in 1691 after Tomoyoshi Sumitomo—the fourth head of the 
Sumitomo family—acquired mining rights from Japan’s feudal government. It thereafter became the foundation of the vari-
ous businesses of the Sumitomo Group. The Sumitomo Foundation was established in 1991 to commemorate the opening 
of the mine 300 years earlier and since then the SuMi TRUST Group has collaborated with the Foundation in various ways. 
For example, we have contributed money, played a part in its management as trustee, and dispatched staff.
Grant Business of the Sumitomo Foundation
As a universal grant-making organization, the Sumitomo Foundation extends grants to research activities and businesses 
in various fields, including basic sciences, the environment, art and culture, and international exchange. From fiscal 1991 
through 2019 the Foundation had awarded a total of 6,794 grants worth more than ¥10.9 billion.

PRB Initiatives
We became a founding signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) advocated for by the United Nations 
Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and launched on September 22, 2019. We are committed to 
collaborating with other signatory banks worldwide to strategically align our business operations with the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The signing of the PRB means we promise to 
be transparent about the positive and negative impacts our banking business has on people and the planet. By focusing 
on the areas in which our core business has the greatest impact, setting goals for specific initiatives, and taking action, 
we hope to make significant contributions towards achieving the targets of the SDGs on both a global and local level.
Having signed on to the PRB, we are obligated to disclose information about our PRB initiatives in our existing 
reports. More specifically, 18 months after signing (i.e., by March 2021 for the Company) and then every year thereaf-
ter, we must report on progress and self-assessments, and then within four years fully implement the following neces-
sary steps as a signatory bank: (1) impact analysis; (2) target setting and implementation; and (3) accountability. Our 
first initiative is shown below.

Japan caused by the repeated visitation of powerful typhoons. At our Board of Directors

TCFD Report 2020/2021. The results of our transition risk scenario analysis of the 
electric power sector indicated that without any investment in renewable energy 
power generation, credit ratings would worsen by 2–3 notches in either scenario 
(2°C and above 3°C), but in contrast, active investment in renewable energy power 
generation would mean credit ratings remain unchanged. While the results of this 
analysis suggested a change in credit ratings, we will continue to examine what 
kind of impact they have on our financials and the analysis methods we use. We will 
also consider utilizing the risk and opportunity key points obtained from qualitative 
assessments and the suggestions gained from the analysis process when we engage 
with the companies to whom we extend investments and loans.

relevant information
In our physical risk scenario analysis of personal mortgage loans, we calculated that 
credit costs on mortgage loans at SuMi TRUST Bank would increase by around ¥7.0 
billion by the year 2100 compared to the end of March 2020 based on the proba-
bility of floods occurring and the rate of change in property value caused by flood 
damage in either a 2°C or 4°C scenario.
We think the impact on our financials would be limited.
Although the marine transportation sector carries a medium-level risk for both transi- TCFD Report 2020/2021
tion and physical risks, it has a high exposure to climate change. Furthermore, we aim  Page 14
to help mitigate climate change risks in the shipping industry, having become the first 
financial institution in Asia to sign onto the Poseidon Principles. For these reasons we 
are conducting a transition risk scenario analysis of this sector in fiscal 2020.
In this report we have highlighted some case examples of our climate change anal-
ysis, but going forward we hope to undertake analyses of biodiversity and specific 
sectors for which we have announced policies, such as forestry and palm oil.

(2) Medium- to long-term CO2 reduction targets
As a signatory to the PRB and PRI, the SuMi TRUST Group itself also engages in sus-
tainable finance and ESG investment practices and we therefore have a responsibility 
to help solve environmental problems through business activities and reduce our 
environmental footprint as stated in our Sustainability Policy.
We are targeting a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions at SuMi TRUST Bank by fiscal year  TCFD Report 2020/2021
2030 and zero emissions by 2050. Page 22
Around 80% of SuMi TRUST Bank’s CO2 emissions derive from purchased electricity, 
while some 10% is generated by the combustion of utility gas through in-house power 
generation. Accordingly, the Bank aims to halve its emissions mainly by adopting elec-
tricity-related measures as an initiative for working towards the fiscal 2030 target.

revised our policies for specific sectors, but we also formed a TCFD Project Team and released our first-ever TCFD Report.
We also disclosed information about biodiversity in a report on natural capital, but going forward, we intend to take the necessary steps to further enhance 
our policies for specific sectors.

reports. The initial guidelines were issued in 2000, then revised in fiscal years 2002, 2006 and 2013. In fiscal 2016, new

Financial Review
In the consolidated financial results for fiscal year 2019, net business profit before credit costs increased by ¥6.7 billion 
year on year to ¥289.0 billion, basically in line with our forecasts. The rise was mainly due to an increase in effective inter-
est related earnings, an expansion of non-interest revenues in corporate-related business, and an increase in market-re-
lated revenues in SuMi TRUST Bank.
In the meantime, net income attributable to owners of the parent decreased by ¥10.8 billion year on year to ¥163.0 
billion, due mainly to a special loan loss provision of approximately ¥25 billion recorded in preparation for future total 
credit costs in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
