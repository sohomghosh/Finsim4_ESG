potential for the industry. It is expected that within the next  s
10 years, Pension AUM is likely to cross Mutual Fund AUM, 
increasing our business opportunity.
Overall, the MF industry is undergoing a fast transformation 
today. However, with a low AUM to GDP ratio and overall 
penetration as a percentage of GDP, India still lags behind 
countries like the US, Canada, France, and Brazil. The MF 
industry is still largely untapped. There are multiple growth 
drivers like overall economic growth, a growing investor 
base, higher disposable income levels, investable household 
surplus, higher awareness levels, and a favourable 
demography. These drivers have immense potential and 
are likely to propel growth going forward. The AMCs with a 
strong retail brand, large distributor network, and significant 
presence in B30 cities, will have the advantage of growing 
faster. UTI AMC is well positioned on all these fronts.
Striving to make a difference
Our consistent focus has been on our investors and 
stakeholders. We have been working relentlessly to enhance 
value for them by implementing relevant strategies, building 
a stronger brand which is known for its integrity and 
innovation. The listing of UTI AMC has brought in enhanced

Covid-19 impact: As a part of our response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we reinforced our operational risk 
management and enhanced our business continuity programme. It helped us scale beyond the physical office premises 
and enabled our employees to work from home with secure remote access (including usage of virtual private networks 
and two-factor authentication for software as a service-based application). Additionally, we also adopted certain 
policies and procedures to manage various risks applicable to our operations. Even under a digital environment, 
the basics of the risk management process remain the same. Hence, even during these testing times, we continue to 
operate within strong governance structures, and we will continually endeavour to enhance and strengthen it.

STATUTORY REPORTS
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
DEBT MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK
The Financial year 2020-21 started with the economic uncertainty due to the lockdowns imposed in the country as a result of Covid-19. 
Government revenues were hit hard due to significant reduction in economic activities. The Government responded swiftly to the 
pandemic and its impact on the economy, by announcing various relief packages to support growth. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
responded to the situation by announcing aggressive liquidity infusion by way of LTROs, TLTROs, OMO purchases, Operation Twist 
etc., to ensure that yields do not spike, at a time, when the economy was on a downward trajectory due to the lockdowns. 
These liquidity infusion measures have been successful in pulling down the overall yield curve with 10-year yield moderating from 
6.30% at the start of year to the lows of 5.75% during the year. The benefits of easy liquidity have been reflected more in the short end 
of the curve with overnight rates falling even below 3% and settling in the range of 3.00% to 3.25% for most of the second half of the 
fiscal. Helped by these easy liquidity conditions among other factors, we have seen GDP going back to pre-covid levels in 3rd quarter of 
the Financial Year, along with inflationary pressures building up (reflected in core CPI data). This resulted in RBI moving in the direction 
of gradual liquidity withdrawal in the last quarter of the fiscal, which in turn, resulted in markets building expectations of increase in 
short term funding cost sometime in 2nd half of next fiscal.
However, getting into the FY22, we witnessed the emergence of 2nd wave of Covid-19, which has started impacting the economic 
activity. This has resulted in markets pricing out possibility of liquidity withdrawal anytime soon. While, the markets continue to assess the 
impact of this 2nd wave on the overall economic activity, we expect this impact to be limited, due to vaccination drive being carried out 
by the various Governments. This drive may help in ensuring that the lockdowns may not last for a longer time as compared to last year. 
The scope for RBI to provide further accommodation remains limited at a time when globally yields are heading higher in anticipation 
of improvement in economic growth. We have also witnessed upward pressures on the global commodity prices, which may result in 
upward movement of domestic CPI. In this backdrop, the market will watch out for cues from RBI on how long they will be willing to 
F
continue with the current liquidity surplus. Any liquidity withdrawal on part of RBI will be likely only after we see meaningful revival in  IN
A
growth expectations, which in turn will depend on our capability to swiftly vaccinate a large part of population. Overall, it becomes  N

OVERVIEW ON EQUITY MARKET AND OUTLOOK E
N
T
Nifty 50 climbed 73% during FY21, which was one of the sharpest rallies in the last decade. This performance is accentuated by the  S
sharp collapse in the market that occurred during the last two months of FY20, as the COVID-19 pandemic propagated. Indian equities 
rallied along with most of the global equity markets as central banks worldwide embarked on record monetary stimulus. At the same 
time, governments across the world adopted a counter-cyclical fiscal policy by embarking on fiscal spending to pull their respective 
economies out of a recession. In India, the Government also undertook a series of supply side measures to improve the long-term 
growth potential of the economy.
Unlike in the previous two years, the participation in the rally was broad based and not restricted to select list of heavyweight stocks. 
Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 Indices rose by ~100% and ~117% respectively in FY 2021, while Nifty 50 rose by ~73%. 
Equities as an asset class also outperformed other asset-classes in the financial year 2021, wherein MCX gold gave a return of ~7.3%, 
and CRISIL Bond Index gave a return of 7.7%.
On the economic front, India entered a technical recession for the first half of fiscal 2021, but has consistently improved the trend, with 
Q1 and Q2 real GDP declining ~24.4%, ~7.3%, respectively, and Q3 reporting 0.4% growth YoY. As per MOSPI estimates, FY21 real 
GDP is expected to contract by 8%. During the first 8 months of FY21 (April to November 2020), CPI inflation was at an elevated level 
(an average of 6.9%) owing to lockdown and supply side constraints that kept the food prices high. However, Inflation eased towards 
the end of the year as supply constraints eased and fell within the MPC’s target band of 2-6%. 
Investment cycle too was affected by COVID-19 and it got reflected in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) dipping to 30.9% of GDP 
as per the second advanced estimates for fiscal 2021. However, GFCF has been improving since Q1 of fiscal 2021 and reached 33% 
of GDP by Q3FY21. The government’s focus on capex spends and manufacturing during the union budget for fiscal 2022, along with 
lower interest rates and expected revival in global demand, are creating a conducive environment for the capex cycle.
The global growth outlook remains robust despite the second wave of COVID-19 due to normalizing economic activities and record 
fiscal and monetary stimulus unveiled globally by governments and central banks, respectively. The availability of vaccines and rapid 
vaccination drive globally are building hopes of speedy recovery over the course of the year. The IMF projected the global economy to 
grow 6% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022 in the latest World Economic Outlook April 2021. For India, RBI has projected real GDP growth 
at 10.5% and inflation at ~5% for FY22. The MPC and RBI have indicated an accommodative stance. Reforms undertaken over the

past year and a supportive fiscal stance underpin India’ growth recovery. In this backdrop, Nifty 50 earnings are estimated to grow at 
~25% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the next two years on base of FY21 estimates (Bloomberg estimates). Companies 
that can navigate a challenging period are often well placed to accelerate growth, gain market share and profitability in the subsequent 
period as they face less competition. However current valuations, which are elevated relative to history; make the markets vulnerable to 
any sharp shifts in global liquidity, inflation expectations, earnings disappointments & a resurgence in Covid-19.
OTHER KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF FINANCIAL YEAR 2020-21: 
FY21 institutional flow: Foreign Portfolio Investors were net buyers across most of FY21, with an equity net inflow of approx. USD 37.3 
billion for FY2021. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers across most months, with total outflows at USD 18.2 billion 
for FY21. Mutual funds remained net sellers with an outflow of close to USD 16.5 billion. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) portion of 
mutual fund inflows witnessed a downward trend before bouncing back in the month of March 2021. The average monthly run-rate of 
SIPs for FY21 was INR 80 billion in FY21. 
While all key sector indices ended FY21 with gains, various sector indices like NSE Metals (159%), NSE Auto (109.8%), NSE IT 
(105.8%), BSE Power (86.1%) outperformed the Nifty 50 Index (73%) while NSE FMCG (31.7%), BSE Telecom (34.4%) underperformed 
the Nifty 50.
FY21 witnessed recovery in primary market activity with fund raising via IPOs, FPOs, OFS, Rights issue, etc. rising from INR 1.47 trillion 
in FY20 to INR 2.55 trillion in FY21.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Contd.)
AUM of flexi-cap, multi cap, large cap, large and mid-cap, mid-cap, and ELSS together accounted for 68.9% of the industry’s 
open-ended growth/equity-oriented scheme closing AUM as on 31 March, 2021. Average AUM of other categories of funds 
(including ETFs, Index funds and FoF investing overseas) saw robust growth of over 14.9 times (a CAGR of 71.7%) over a lower 
base as institutional investors such as the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) began investing a portion (currently 
15%) of their incremental deposits into equities via passively managed funds, an industry trend expected to continue for the 
medium term.
The Average AUM of liquid/money market funds grew at a CAGR of 13.1% from March 2016 to  March 2021, supported by 
corporate investments, stable returns, and a high level of aggregate re-allocations from long-term debt instruments.
Going forward, it is expected that increased financial savings as well as improving investor awareness may drive industry growth, 
following a broader economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In fiscal 2021, within the debt-oriented categories, corporate bond funds, which typically invest in an underlying portfolio of higher 
rated papers, emerged as the biggest contributor in this asset class with net inflows of INR 693.05 billion over the 12 months 
ended March 2021. Credit risk funds saw the highest net outflows, at INR 289.23 billion, over the same period. 
In fiscal 2021, in the equity-oriented funds, sectoral/ thematic funds recorded the highest net inflows of INR 98.01 billion, aided 
by new thematic fund launches in the category, while large cap funds recorded the highest net outflows of INR 105.87 billion, as 
investors worried about expensive valuation after the recent sharp run-up in the market.
Equity-oriented funds also benefitted from continued inflows through systematic investment plans. The industry witnessed net flows 
of INR 960.80 billion in fiscal 2021 compared with ~INR 1,000 billion of inflows in the previous fiscal.
In fiscal 2021, under the hybrid funds, arbitrage funds which exploit volatility in the equity market to generate returns, recorded the 
highest net inflows of INR 269.08 billion, while aggressive hybrid schemes posted the highest net outflows of ~INR 258.47 billion. 
In the fiscal, equity ETF inflows were ~INR 398.20 billion and gold ETF inflows ~INR 69.19 billion. The two categories’ AUM rose 
~88% and 78%, respectively, over the one year ended March.
2]   Mutual Fund Industry Outlook:
The pandemic-induced developments notwithstanding, as economic activities resume and gather pace, businesses should see 
heightened requirement of funds. Thus, liquid and arbitrage funds might witness pressure again due to outflows. In addition, 
corporates are expected to reduce their exposure to debt funds, at least in the riskier categories. 
In the long term, with expectation of higher returns from the capital markets, fund flow into equity funds is expected to pick up. 
Increasing share of mutual funds in household savings, driven by expectations of higher and stable returns, is one of the key 
contributors of fund inflows, especially into passive and equity funds. A gradual improvement in corporate earnings, controlled 
inflation, stable political environment, consistent growth in mutual fund inflows and ~9% growth in nominal gross domestic 
product (GDP) post fiscal 2021 are expected to deepen mutual fund penetration. 
80 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
STATUTORY REPORTS
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Contd.)
As per a CRISIL report, the industry’s quarterly average AUM (QAAUM) is expected to increase at ~14% CAGR between March 
2020 and 2025. The growth is expected to be led by equity funds, which will continue to garner strong investor interest. Average 
equity AUM is expected to increase at ~18% CAGR to ~Rs 25 trillion by fiscal 2025, from Rs 11.1 trillion in March 2020, driven 
by strong inflows. Strong growth in equity funds will increase their share in the overall fund pie from 42% to 47% by March 2025, 
in line with the global average.
3]   Key Challenges:
The Indian economy has faced its first contraction in more than four decades due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
impact of this pandemic is likely to widen India’s fiscal deficit, which could exacerbate the structural risk factors and make India’s 
economy vulnerable to possible downside risk and volatility.
Retail participation and inflows into mutual funds and other market-linked products are heavily influenced by market performance 
and sentiment. A prolonged downturn or ongoing volatility could result in further decline in aggregate demand for market-linked 
products and cause industry AUMs to shift into relatively lower-risk assets.

or 34.7%, from INR 889.96 crore for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an 
increase in net gains on fair value changes and from increase in revenue from the sale of services.
(b)  Revenue from Operations:
  Revenue from operations increased by INR 314.49 crore, or 36.8%, from INR 854.03 crore in the fiscal year ended 
31 March, 2020 to INR 1,168.52 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in 
revenue from sales of services and higher net gains on fair value changes. Revenue from operations as a percentage 
of total income was 97.5% for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021 compared to 96.0% for the fiscal year ended 31 
March, 2020.

  Other income decreased by INR 5.82 crore, or 16.18%, from INR 35.93 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 
2020 to INR 30.11 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to lower foreign

exchange difference. Other income as a percentage of total income was 2.5% for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 
2021 compared to 4.0% for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020.
(d)  Expenses:
(i)  Fees and Commission Expenses: Fees and commission expenses increased by INR 0.05 crore, or 1.83%, 
from INR 2.91 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020 to INR 2.96 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 
2021. This was primarily a result of the incremental commission paid for the new fund raised in UTI Structured 
Debt Opportunities Fund - II by UTI Capital.
(ii)  Finance Cost: Finance cost decreased by INR 1.29 crore or 13.79% from INR 9.35 crore in the fiscal year 
ended 31 March, 2020 to INR 8.06 crore in fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021. This is primarily as a result of 
reclassification of leases and renegotiation in the rental for various UFCs amid to COVID 19 Pandemic.
(iii) Employee Benefit Expenses: Employee benefit expenses increased by INR 39.60 crore, or 11.65%, from 
INR 339.88 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020 to INR 379.48 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 
March, 2021. This increase was primarily due to increase in expenses incurred in respect of the employee share 
option scheme and an increase in variable pay, salary cost, health insurance and Actuarial Cost for the financial 
year 2020-21. Employee benefit expenses as a percentage of total income is 31.66% for the fiscal year ended 
31 March, 2021 as compared to 38.19% for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020, primarily as result of the 
increase in our total income.

2.19 crore, or 6.53%, from INR 33.59 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020 to INR 35.78 crore in the

income were 14.13% for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021 compared to 18.31% for the fiscal year ended 
31 March, 2020.
(vi) Profit Before Tax: Profit before tax for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021 was INR 603.03 crore, an 
increase of INR 261.73 crore, or 76.69%, from INR 341.30 crore for the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020. 
This increase is primarily due to increase in revenue from the sale of services and higher net gains on fair value 
changes, partly offset by an increase in employee benefit expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and 
other expenses. As a percentage of total income, profit before tax was 50.31% in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 
2021 and 38.35% in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2020.

ended 31 March, 2020. Current tax increased by INR 8.75 crore, or 11.76%, from INR 74.43 crore in the fiscal 
year ended 31 March, 2020 to INR 83.18 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March, 2021, primarily due to an 
increase in our profit before tax. Deferred tax increased by INR 33.67 crore or 420.37%, from INR (8.01) crore

Risks associated with Defined Benefit Plan:
Interest Rate Risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the Government Securities Rate will increase the present 
value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the 
assets depending on the duration of asset.
Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of 
members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.
Investment Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset 
is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments 
in government securities, and other debt instruments.
160 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (Contd.)
Asset Liability Matching Risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does 
not have any longevity risk.
Concentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance Company and a 
default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory 
guidelines.
(viii) Sensitivity Analysis:
The benefit obligation results of pension scheme and gratuity fund are particularly sensitive to discount rate, longevity risk, 
salary escalation rate and pension increases, if the plan provision do provide for such increases on commencement of 
pension.
The above table summarized the impact in percentage terms on the reported defined benefit obligation at the end of the 
reporting year arising on account changes in these three key parameters. 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation and assuming there 
are no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. There have been no changes from the previous year in 
the methods and assumption used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.

47. EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE 
The outbreak of COVID - 19 pandemic has affected several countries across the world, including India. The Government is undertaking 
several measures to restrict the spread of virus and provide financial support to some stressed sectors. Further, while the COVID-19 
vaccination efforts have gained momentum, uncertainty due to the resurgence of COVID cases across many parts of India is rising. The 
extent to which the second wave of COVID 19 pandemic will impact the Company’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future 
developments, which at this juncture are highly uncertain.
It is expected that economic activity will continue to improve as the residual restrictions are eased gradually. The Company has assessed 
the impact of the pandemic on its operations and its assets including the value of its investments and trade receivables as at 31 March 
2021. The management does not, at this juncture, believe that the impact on the value of the Company’s assets is likely to be material. 
Business continuity plans have been invoked to help ensure the safety and well-being of staff thereby retaining the ability to maintain 
business operations following lockdowns in India. These actions help to ensure business resilience. Since the situation is still evolving 
and it seems likely that there will be a material impact on the economy, its effect on the operations of the Company may be different 
from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial results. The Company continues to closely monitor material changes 
in markets and future economic conditions.
Further, during the quarter ended 31 March 2021, there has been no material change in the controls or processes followed in the 
preparation of the financial results.

prevailing,, which in turn will affect the value of underlying investments in corporate bonds and money market securities. Increase in 
interest rate prevailing in the market will decrease market value of the underlying securities and vice versa, particularly for long duration 
securities. These investments are monitored by Asset Management body set-up by the Group’s parent company. No specific monitoring 
of the underlying investments are made by the Company. Deposits with banks carry fixed interest rates.

The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, assessed the potential impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic 
on the Company. The coronavirus outbreak is a new emerging risk to the global economy. The Company’s business may be impacted 
by falling revenues as a result of decreases in the NAVs of the underlying funds on which the management fees for the Company are 
calculated.  Business continuity plans have been invoked to help ensure the safety and well-being of staff thereby retaining the ability to 
maintain business operations following lockdowns in India. These actions help to ensure business resilience. The situation is changing 
so rapidly that the full impact cannot yet be understood, but the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.
The directors consider that the Company have adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements

Determination of fair values
The Company measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making 
the measurements.
  Level 1: Quoted price (unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.)
  Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e, derived from prices). This 
category includes instruments valued using: quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments: quoted prices for identical or 
similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are 
directly or indirectly observable from market data.
  Level 3: Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation 
technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s 
valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quota prices for similar instruments for which significant 
unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
Fair value is calculated on the basis of daily rates posted on the Bloomberg website (Level 1).

21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES & POLICIES
The Directors consider that their main risk management objective is to monitor and mitigate material risks, which they consider 
including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market price risk and foreign currency risk. 
Several procedures are in place to enable material risks to be adequately managed. These include preparation and review of annual 
forecasts and monthly management accounts. For the current period there is no concentration of risk observed by the management.
The key risks are summarised below:
(a)  Credit risk
  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to 
a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing 
activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 
IFRS 9 requires impairment loss allowances to be recognised at an amount equal to either 12-month expected credit loss (ECL) 
(‘stage 1 ECLs) or lifetime ECLs. 12 months ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events that are possible within 
12 months after reporting date. ‘Stage 2’ ECLs are lifetime ECLs that are recognised where there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk of the financial instrument and ‘stage 3’ ECLs are lifetime ECLs that are recognised where the financial instruments 
is considered to be credit impaired.
(i)   Exposure to credit risk
  At the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of 
each class of financial assets recognised in the statement of financial position.
 (ii)  Financial assets that are neither past due nor credit impaired

record with the Company. The Company derives its main source of revenue from providing fund management services to  C

its affiliates. Exposure to credit risk arising from related party transactions is minimal as these affiliates are of good credit  L

standing. Cash and bank balances of the group comprises of cash and deposits placed with major international banks. TA

(iii)   Financial assets that are either past due or impaired M
E
N
  There is no financial asset that is either past due or credit impaired or would be otherwise require a material loss allowance  TS
under the ECL model as 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020. 
(b)  Liquidity risk
  Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The 
Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities.
  The Company’s policy on liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient cash and the availability of funding. Cash balances 
and forecast cash movements are reviewed on a regular basis, bank reconciliations are prepared and reviewed daily and 
management accounts are prepared and reviewed monthly to ensure that the Company maintains adequate working capital. The 
Company’s financial assets are short-term in nature which mitigates the risk of default on financial obligations. At the end of the 
reporting period, all of the Company’s financial liabilities will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount reflected 
in the financial statements.
  The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (Contd.)
(c)   Interest rate risk
  Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Company’s financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes 
in market interest rates. The Company’s interest-bearing assets are cash deposits placed with banks of GBP 9,048,925 as at 31 
March 2021 and GBP 5,207,870 as at 31 March 2020 and cash at bank of GBP 8,394,548 as at 31 March 2021 and GBP 
6,621,813 as at 31 March 2020. The Company’s policy is to maximise the returns on these interest-bearing assets. The Company 
does not have any borrowings. Directors have deemed the sensitivity risk to be immaterial.
(d)  Currency risk
  Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The 
Company’s financial exposure is denominated in various other currencies shown in the currency profile below. Consequently, the 
Company is exposed to the risk that the exchange rate of these currencies relative to GBP may change in a manner, which has a 
material effect on the reported values of its assets denominated in GBP.
  The currency risk profile of the Company’s net financial exposure is summarised below:

(e)  Market price risk
  Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Company’s financial instruments will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. The Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from its investment in quoted equity securities. These 
instruments are classified as financial assets at fair value through Profit or loss. The Company’s objective is to manage investment 
returns and equity price risk using a mix of investment grade shares with steady dividend yield and noninvestment grade shares 
with higher volatility.
  Sensitivity analysis for equity price risk:
  At the end of the reporting period, if the share prices of the equity securities had been 10% higher/lower with all other variables 
held constant, the Company’s income statement would have been GBP 3,137,799 as at 31 March 2021 and GBP 2,271,932 
as at 31 March 2020 higher/lower, arising as a result of an increase/decrease in the fair value of equity securities classified as 
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
22. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit position and healthy capital 
ratios in order to support its business and maximize shareholder value.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust dividend payment to shareholders, or issue shares, or extend the payment period 
for the supplier (Investment Advisors) or accelerate receipt from the debtors (Funds which the Company manages).

26. EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, assessed the potential impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic 
on the Company. The coronavirus outbreak is a new emerging risk to the global economy. The Company’s business may be impacted 
by falling revenues as a result of decreases in the NAVs of the underlying funds on which the management fees for the Company are 
calculated.  Business continuity plans have been invoked to help ensure the safety and well-being of staff thereby retaining the ability to 
maintain business operations following lockdowns. These actions help to ensure business resilience. The situation is changing so rapidly 
that the full impact cannot yet be understood, but the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.
The directors consider that the Company have adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

A. Risk Management Framework:
The company’s board of directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of company’s risk management 
framework. The company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the company, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and company’s activities.
B. Credit Risk:
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a 
financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (mostly trade receivables) and from its financing 
activities, including deposits with banks and other financial assets. The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum 
credit risk exposure.
Trade receivables:
Major portion of trade receivables include the Management fees receivable from National Pension System Trust. Based on the past 
experience, management expects to receive these amounts without any default.

STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO ACCOUNTS ANNEXED TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (Contd.)
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to determine incurred and 
expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the 
macroeconomic indicators affecting customers of the Company have not undergone any substantial change, the Company expects the 
historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue.
Financial Instruments & cash deposits:
The Investments of the Company are primarily in Mutual Fund schemes.
The Company holds cash & cash equivalents of INR 22,680 as on 31 March 2021. The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks 
which are rated AA- to AA+, based on CRISIL ratings. The Company considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk 
based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
Following is the exposure of the Company towards credit risk.

C.  Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or financial asset. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.
Following is the exposure of the Company towards liquidity risk:

and mortality. The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

The aggregate amortisation expense on right-of-use asset is included under depreciation and amortisation expense in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
Effective 1 April 2019, the Company adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the standard to all lease contracts existing on 1 April 
2019 using the modified retrospective method on the date of initial application. Consequently, the Company recorded the lease liability 
and right of use at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.
On transition to Ind AS 116, the Company recognised INR 2.04 crore of right-of-use assets and INR 2.04 crore of lease liabilities. 
When measuring lease liabilities, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at 1 April 2019. The 
weighted-average rate applied is 8.50%.

The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, assessed the potential impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic 
on the Company. The coronavirus outbreak is a new emerging risk to the global economy. The Company’s business may be impacted 
due to decrease in the NAV of the underlying funds on which the management fees for the Company is calculated.  Business continuity 
plans have been invoked to maintain business operations following lockdowns across India which will help to ensure business resilience. 
The situation is changing so rapidly that the full impact cannot yet be understood, but the Company will continue to monitor the 
situation closely.
The directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

2.4 Property, plant and equipment:
  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. The 
cost of acquisition is inclusive of duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to acquisition and installation of the assets. 
Subsequent expenditure related to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment is added to its book value, only if it increases the 
future benefits from existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. Capital work in progress is stated at 
cost.
  For transition to Ind AS, the group has elected to adopt as deemed cost, the carrying value of PPE measured as per I-GAAP less 
accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment on the transition date of 01 April 2017. In respect of revalued assets, 
the value as determined by valuers as reduced by accumulated depreciation and cumulative impairment is taken as cost on 
transition date. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of 
the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.
  Gains or losses arising from disposal of Property, Plant and Equipments are measured as the differences between the net disposal 
proceeds and carrying amount of asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is disposed.
  Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital 
work in progress and Capital advance”.
  Depreciation method is reviewed at each financial year end to reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful life and residual values are also reviewed at each financial year end and the 
effect of any change in the estimates of useful life / residual value is accounted on prospective basis.
  Where cost of a part of the asset (“asset component”) is significant to total cost of the asset and useful life of that part is different 
from the useful life of the remaining asset, useful life of that significant part is determined separately and such asset component is 
depreciated over its separate useful life. F

Risks associated with Defined Benefit Plan:
Interest Rate Risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the Government Securities Rate will increase the present 
value of the liability requiring higher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increases the mark to market value of the 
assets depending on the duration of asset.
Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of 
members. As such, an increase in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.
Investment Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset 
is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India, it has a relatively balanced mix of investments 
in government securities, and other debt instruments.

STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (Contd.)
Asset Liability Matching Risk: The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow. Since the plan is invested in 
lines of Rule 101 of Income Tax Rules, 1962, this generally reduces ALM risk.
Mortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan does 
not have any longevity risk.
Concentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk as all the assets are invested with the insurance Company and a 
default will wipe out all the assets. Although probability of this is very less as insurance companies have to follow regulatory 
guidelines.
(viii) Sensitivity Analysis:
The benefit obligation results of pension scheme and gratuity fund are particularly sensitive to discount rate, longevity risk, 
salary escalation rate and pension increases, if the plan provision do provide for such increases on commencement of 
pension.
The above table summarised the impact in percentage terms on the reported defined benefit obligation at the end of the 
reporting year arising on account changes in these three key parameters. 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation and assuming there 
are no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. There have been no changes from the previous year in 
the methods and assumption used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.

38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has an exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
  Credit Risk
  Liquidity Risk
  Market Risk
Risk Management Framework:
The Management has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of Company’s risk management framework. The 
Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk 
limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and Group’s activities. 
A. Credit Risk:
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a 
financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (mostly trade receivables) and from its financing activities, 
including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. The carrying 
amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure.
376 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-21
STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021 (Contd.)
Financial services business has a risk management framework that monitors and ensures that the business lines operate within the 
defined risk appetite and risk tolerance levels as defined by the senior management. The credit risk function independently evaluates 
proposals based on well-established sector specific internal frameworks, in order to identify, mitigate and allocate risks as well as to 
enable risk-based pricing of assets. Regulatory and process risks are identified, mitigated and managed by a separate group. 
Trade receivables:
Major portion of trade receivables include the AMC fees receivable from UTI Mutual Fund, SUTTI, CMPFO, ESIC, EPFO and amount 
receivable from PLI & RPLI. Based on the past experience, management expects to receive these amounts without any default.
Trade Receivables (INR in crore) March 2021 March 2020
0-90 Days 38.47 38.11
91-180 Days 2.79 4.30

271-365 Days 0.86 1.37
More than 365 Days 2.30 1.37
Total 45.52 45.61
Exposures to customers outstanding at the end of each reporting period are reviewed by the Company to determine incurred and 
expected credit losses. Historical trends of impairment of trade receivables do not reflect any significant credit losses. Given that the 
macroeconomic indicators affecting customers of the Group have not undergone any substantial change, the Group expects the 
historical trend of minimal credit losses to continue. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by 
more than 365 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behavior and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. F

B. Liquidity Risk:
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses 
or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Group’s liquidity requirements. 
The Group uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment 
objectives. The Group typically invests in money market funds, large debt funds, equity funds and other highly rated securities under a 
limits framework which governs the credit exposure to any one issuer as defined in its investment policy. The policy requires investments 
generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss

C. Market Risk:
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity 
risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits.
Interest rate risk:
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s financial Instruments. 
All of the Group’s interest rate risk exposure is at a fixed rate. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not 
affect statement of profit and loss for any of these fixed interest bearing financial instruments. Fair value can change due to change in 
interest rate.
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:

Equity price risk:
Price risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices and related market 
variables including interest rate for investments in debt oriented mutual funds and debt securities, caused by factors specific to an 
individual investment, its issuer and market. The Company’s exposure to price risk arises from diversified investments in mutual funds, 
preference shares held by the Company and classified in the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss (note 7).

43. BUSINESS COMBINATION
UTI AMC has a 25.87 per cent investment in the India Infrastructure Development Fund where UTI Capital is the investment manager. 
The investment manager through the Investment management agreement (IMA) has a right to carry out all other relevant activities as 
per its discretion and the investment manager can only be removed with cause. The combination of zero kick out rights together with 
the aggregate economic interest (remuneration and other interests) creates exposure to variability of returns from the activities of the 
fund that is of such significance that it indicates that the Group is a principal.
44. LEASE DISCLOSURES
Company as a lessee:
Effective 01 April 2019, the Group adopted Ind AS 116 “Leases” and applied the standard to all lease contracts existing on 01 April 
2019 using the modified retrospective method on the date of initial application. Consequently, the Group recorded the lease liability 
and right of use at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.
The following is the break-up of current and non-current lease liabilities as at 31 March 2021

The Group does not face a significant liquidity risk with regard to its lease liabilities as the current assets are sufficient to meet the 
obligations related to lease liabilities as and when they fall due.
Rental expense recorded for short-term leases and low value item was INR 0.65 crore for the year ended 31 March 2021.
The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities for 2020-21 is 8.50% for UTI AMC Limited & 3.25% for

50. EVENTS AFTER REPORTING DATE
The outbreak of COVID - 19 pandemic has affected several countries across the world, including India. The Government is undertaking 
several measures to restrict the spread of virus and provide financial support to some stressed sectors. Further, while the COVID-19 
vaccination efforts have gained momentum, uncertainty due to the resurgence of COVID cases across many parts of India is rising. The 
extent to which the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future 
developments, which at this juncture are highly uncertain.
It is expected that economic activity will continue to improve as the residual restrictions are eased gradually. The Company has assessed 
the impact of the pandemic on its operations and its assets including the value of its investments and trade receivables as at 31 March 
2021. The management does not, at this juncture, believe that the impact on the value of the Company’s assets is likely to be material. 
Business continuity plans have been invoked to help ensure the safety and well-being of staff thereby retaining the ability to maintain 
business operations following lockdowns in India. These actions help to ensure business resilience. Since the situation is still evolving 
and it seems likely that there will be a material impact on the economy, its effect on the operations of the Company may be different 
from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial results. The Company continues to closely monitor material changes 
in markets and future economic conditions.
Further, during the quarter ended 31 March 2021, there has been no material change in the controls or processes followed in the 
preparation of the financial results.
