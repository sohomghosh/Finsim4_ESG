1.2.2 Identification of non-financial risks 
As disclosed in the Group’s Annual Report 2019, we undertook a thorough assessment of Corporate Responsibility issues in 2018/19. The aim was to 
identify the most critical environmental, governance and social issues that are relevant to the our stakeholders and which could represent non-financial 
risks or opportunities for our businesses. In recognition of the increased and shifting stakeholder interest in Corporate Responsibility matters, we carried 
out a review off this assessment of non-financial risks affecting its businesses and stakeholders alongside the annual review of strategic risks for the Group 
at the end of 2020. The results of this review are summarised in the below matrix:

Sections 2 and 3 provide an overview of our strategic objectives in each of our Corporate Responsibility priority areas and the relevant policies and 
developments in 2020 aimed at managing identified non-financial risks in our operations, as well as initiatives addressing associated Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in the our business divisions. 
(1)  Methodology: consultation of most recent secondary data sources paired with internal expert consultation lead to an update of a long list of micro-issues related to Corporate Responsibility and 
respective categories that might present non-financial risks and / or opportunities for the firm and its stakeholders. Followed by a risk assessment in consultation with internal experts and calibration 
with Group Risk and responsible members of the senior management team the results of the materiality assessment were approved by the Group Executive Committee in December 2020, and 
considered by the CR Committee and Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board.

Steps taken to 
combat modern 
slavery
We acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread 
economic and social disruption globally, which are key triggers for 
modern slavery risks. These risks stem from the increased social 
isolation, mass unemployment creating opportunities for traffickers 
and the various lockdowns disrupting anti-slavery efforts. We are 
conscious that we will need to continue to hold the Rothschild & Co 
group and our suppliers to high standards in our modern slavery 
response in order to protect those most vulnerable. We will continue 
to work with our Modern Slavery Working Group to address these 
challenges and demonstrate our long-term commitment to combating 
modern slavery and human trafficking.

range of healthcare services and benefits that aim to support their overall 
wellbeing.
Global offices work together to focus on the topics that are relevant and 
unifying around the world. In 2020, the firm ran 16 sessions on physical 
and mental health and wellbeing topics that will benefit all employees, but 
also topics that are relevant on a local level.
A regular wellbeing newsletter is circulated globally with insights on 
nutrition, physical and mental wellbeing.
In 2020, we rolled out Unmind globally, a confidential service with clinically 
backed and easy-to-use tools, which provides ongoing support for people 
to manage topics that impact their health, from improving sleep, to 
mindfulness and stress management.
We seek to comply with all applicable local health and safety laws and 
regulations to provide a healthy and safe work environment.
The Group Health and Safety Policy defines the Group Health and Safety 
conformance standard for offices worldwide, in order to further strengthen 
and improve Health & Safety conformance requirements across all offices. 
More details on the policy can be found in "Additional Information".

Supporting the Asháninka and Awajún communities is one of 
the ways to conserve and protect delicately balanced rainforest 
ecosystems in this region. These communities are suffering from 
lack of access to nutrition and basic healthcare, which leaves them 
faced with the need to sacrifice the forest to logging in order to gain 
income and to help prevent disease and malnutrition. Our support 
provides an alternative for communities to sustain and improve their 
livelihoods, meaning they are no longer reliant on payments from 
loggers for survival and can protect against forest degradation.

In the summer the Group ran a fitness and fundraising challenge 
aimed at helping our colleagues to stay fit, well and connected 
and raise much-needed funds for charities. More than 800 of 
our employees from 15 countries joined forces to compete in the 
challenge. Team members took part in more than 20,000 hours 
of physical activity and worked together to raise funds for 83 
charities worldwide that were suffering from the consequences 
of the pandemic disruption, and the vulnerable people that they 
support. These funds were matched through the company matching 
scheme to further contribute to the amount raised. It was inspiring 
to see colleagues from around the globe coming together to make a 
meaningful difference to our communities.

Career 
mentoring 
in Brazil 
I took part in all of the volunteering opportunities made available to us 
last year. Firstly, an investment banking webinar that was organised 
for 300 Brazilian university students. It was a great opportunity to 
share my knowledge and experience and advise young people around 
career-related topics. We also had the opportunity to virtually mentor 
some young adults who had lost their jobs during COVID-19 or who 
were looking for other job opportunities considering the new market 
environment. This was particularly timely as we saw first-hand the 
effects of the pandemic and how we could help these young people to 
explore their next steps through career focused mentoring. 
My colleagues and I also had the chance to participate in the digital 
recruiting process for a partner organisation’s scholarship programme 
which benefits more than 500 young people; and a webinar for 30 
people focused on the inclusion of women in investment banking. 
Being able to help others and share our knowledge is a big privilege 
and we should make the best use of it.

We have taken a leading role in raising financing for renewable projects and 
making green projects investible. This is particularly the case in relation 
to offshore wind, which is one of the key delivery agents for decarbonising 
the global electricity markets and achieving net-zero. The mass rollout of 
offshore wind globally has resulted in huge falls in costs of deployment

Scope 1 emission remained relatively stable, but Scope 2 market-based emission decreased due to French offices procuring renewable electricity 
contracts, which resulted in a c. 400 tCOe reduction from 2019. 
2
Business travel was significantly affected by COVID-related travel restrictions, as a result a c. 14,500 tCOe has been realised from 2019.
2
IT equipment and server-related emissions have increased due mainly to an increased roll-out of hardware (laptops, screens, etc) to enable more efficient 
homeworking.

Emissions per FTE have seen a significant decrease mainly due to COVID travel restrictions, but also due to renewable electricity procurement in France.
At the time of publication of this report the Group has implemented an Internal Carbon Price (ICP). This mechanism places a monetary value on greenhouse 
gases and is a way to responsibly influence emissions from business operations, including travel, aimed at ensuring the Group pursues emission reduction 
opportunities. The ICP generates a financial support stream for the Group’s environmental management budget, which in turn is used to develop further 
small and medium-scale carbon-reduction opportunities and sustainability projects in line with the supported SDGs.

Total 662.92  606.23  339.27 
Total disposal tonnes/FTE 0.19  0.17 0.10 
Total materials sent for disposal has decreased significantly, due mainly to reduced office occupancy levels across the Group. Other contributing factors 
to a reduced recycling rate (39% in 2020 vs. 50% in 2019) was the reduction in high volume / heavy items (predominately paper, glass, and compostable 
material) being produced. For example, in the London office, a significant producer of recyclable material, the rates of recycling paper, glass and 
compostable material fell to zero for six months between April and November.

Whilst Rothschild & Co is not a large consumer of water, it recognises its responsibility in the countries where it operates. 
Water use decreased significantly, due mainly to reduced office occupancy levels across the Group.
A.4.3. Resource management

Total materials consumption 269.30  233.42  114.55 
Tonnes/FTE 0.08 0.07  0.03 
Rothschild & Co understands that applying a traditional approach to resources use can place undue pressure on global resources, is wasteful and not 
economically viable in an increasingly challenging business environment. To that end, we ensure that we manage our resource use responsibly and as far 
as practicable.
Materials use predominately means paper use, although an increase in reporting scope over the years has resulted in more material types being added. 
The Group measures the amount of 100% recycled and sustainably sourced paper it procures (certified sustainable paper from FSC or PEFC). Responsible 
management of materials use is embedded in the Group’s working practices. 
In 2020 a group-wide Responsible Material Use Standard was implemented to further reduce consumables and track their use. As a result, by the end of 
2020 all new orders of printing paper by offices were for paper from sustainable sources.
Material use decreased significantly, due mainly to reduced office occupancy levels across the Group. 
Energy use
Total energy use in MWh 2018 2019 2020
Bioenergy 1,385.78  4,618.83  4,361.36 
Electricity 17,312.59  19,121.56  15,003.12

Other fuel 180.65  157.23  139.14 
Total Energy Consumed 24,010.57  26,216.92  21,701.10 
MWh/FTE 6.85  7.56 6.18
The reduction in energy use is mainly from electricity consumption decreases in offices due to reduced office occupancy levels across the Group.
The Group’s total extrapolated energy use across its offices is 21,701 MWh and of this 69% (15,003 MWh) is electricity. 
Across reporting offices, we expanded our renewable electricity procurement to 85%, up from 56% in 2019. Renewable electricity and sustainable energy 
sources (renewable electricity and biogas) covered 79% of FTE in 2020.
Local measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace reduced the effectiveness of some of the recycling initiatives that had been rolled 
out (e.g. the removal of under desk waste bins in the London office and the implementation of centralised specialist recycling stations in the Paris office), 
aimed at encouraging employees to separate recyclable and non-recyclable materials and reduce contamination. The reduced opportunities for such 
behaviour changes in the COVID-19 environment resulted in an increased incineration volume.
72   Rothschild & Co | Corporate Responsibility Report 2020
A.4.4. Amount of provisions and guarantees 
for environmental risk
Rothschild & Co undertook a legal compliance and conformance 
assessment to understand the legal environmental responsibilities in each 
jurisdiction where Rothschild & Co has an office. This assessment led to the 
development of the Group environmental conformance standard for offices 
worldwide, and which the Group regularly monitors and uses to improve 
continuously.
Provisions have been identified in order to meet European Union (EU) 
energy efficiency obligations relevant to EU member states. Provisions in 
the United Kingdom have been identified for operational environmental 
risk, pertaining to the outgoing CRC energy efficiency scheme (formerly the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment) and the Streamlined Energy and Carbon 
Reporting (SERC) scheme.
As an office-based business, Rothschild & Co does not consider 
environmental discharges to air, water, soil or indeed noise pollution to be of 
material environmental risk.
