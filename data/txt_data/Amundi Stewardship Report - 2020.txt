Preface
Amundi and stewardship
ESG and stewardship have been a core part of Amundi’s investment approach since creation.
We fully acknowledge our role as stewards on behalf of our clients, working to maintain and increase the value 
of assets in which we invest for them, and using the full range of rights and influence that investment brings 
to help us to do so effectively. We recognise the role that finance can play in delivering real world impacts, 
and look to minimise harms and to work to address key issues, in particular the two major contemporary 
challenges: climate change (visible in the climate transition and the need to protect ecosystems), and social 
cohesion and fairness. 
We therefore welcome the development of Stewardship Codes around the world, and the recommendation of 
the Shareholder Rights Directive II that each EU country should have its own such Code. We see Stewardship 
Codes as an important reminder to institutional investors of the influence that they wield and the need for them 
to wield it wisely to deliver real world outcomes that operate in the interests of their clients and beneficiaries. 
We seek to adhere not just to the words of those Codes but also to their spirit. 
This report sets out our response to the requirements of a number of different Stewardship Codes, and we 
believe that it is a full answer to the questions that each Code raises. As an appendix, we provide a guide to how 
this report delivers on the expectations of the EFAMA Stewardship Code, and the relevant codes and principles 
for Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan and the UK.

Introduction
Foreword 
“Amundi believes that having a strong stewardship policy and making a positive 
contribution to society’s key global challenges is part of its fiduciary duty as a 
responsible asset manager. Since 2015 in particular, progressive alignment with 
the framework set out in Paris Agreement has been paramount to our overall 
strategy and relationship with the companies we invest in. 
As stewards on behalf of our clients, we use Amundi’s influence as a Global 
Asset Manager to seek to deliver real world impact. We integrate ESG risks and 
opportunities in our investment decisions, engage with companies on ESG issues, 
and take ESG considerations into account in our voting activities. We believe 
these actions not only drive long term value for our clients’ portfolios, they 
provide an impetus for positive change in our society. We focus our efforts on two 
major contemporary challenges: climate change (visible in the climate transition 
and the need to protect ecosystems), and social cohesion and fairness.
The socioeconomic inequalities exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis is a brutal 
reminder that all around the world, vulnerable populations, companies and 
countries, are extremely sensitive to shocks. This pandemic also highlighted 
the fact that international collaboration and solidarity are the only effective 
responses to address global challenges. This is applicable to governments, but 
also to the private sector and the financial community above all.
For the companies we invest in, adapting their business models to the climate 
challenge as well as aligning with the Paris Agreement is not just desirable 
anymore, but a necessity to ensure long-term growth and profitability. 
Furthermore, in the context of the current pandemic, equitable sharing of added 
value is more important than ever: there will be no profitable companies in which 
to invest on a planet ravaged by climate change, or in societies torn apart by 
inequality. Asset managers cannot be a substitute for government and public 
authorities however, we have an important role to play.
It is not easy to foster positive change. We aim to play our part through the 
active dialogue we have with the companies we invest in as well as through 
our voting activity. We shall be modest. Ultimately, these companies are 
the real manufacturers of a fair transition and we cannot replace the role of 
company management. Nevertheless, we hope to contribute positively to this 
transformation through our responsible climate and social stewardship.”

Amundi and ESG: our philosophy  
and approach
Amundi is the leading European asset manager, and seeks to be a trusted partner that acts every day in the 
interest of its clients and society. Our ability to earn the trust of a wide variety of private and institutional 
investors all over the world has led us to have a global client base of over 100 million retail clients through 
our distribution partners as well as our direct institutional and corporate clients.
ESG has always formed a key part of our values and  Since its creation in 2010, from the merger of Crédit

conscious of the needs of the world around them.
Our core investment beliefs are founded on the understanding that long-term and sustainable success lies in 
collective effort and solid processes. Those beliefs are:

1.  In a more liberal economy, economic and financial actors have a greater responsibility towards society.
2.  As long-term investors, asset managers have a major role to play in directing capital towards. Such as 
projects related to the energy transition. 
3.  We must also influence the strategies of companies, especially when we are among their main 
shareholders. ESG is a means of channelling money to the leading actors on these criteria, or on the 
contrary to put pressure on laggards, as part of a constructive dialogue.
4.  We have a responsibility to our customers: we must deliver performance over the long term. And in a 
world where intangible assets represent an important part of the overall valuation of companies, ESG 
makes it possible to capture the decisive criteria over the long term.
The third item here makes clear how central steward ship is to our ESG mindset, and to our overall investment 
approach. We recognise that we are part-owners of the companies in which we invest and have an obligation 
to influence their strategies towards approaches that more effectively take account of ESG issues. We seek 
constructive dialogue to help drive change by laggards, and to support those which are already delivering 
positively in terms of their ESG approaches.
This mindset of long-term part-ownership and collaboration with our investee companies means that our 
stewardship approach is framed by our understanding of five key factors:

We are confident that this approach leads over time to significant change at investee companies that is fully in 
clients’ best interests as well as having positive real world impacts. Some examples of these positive successes 
are discussed in detail in the engagement section of this report and in our annual engagement report available 
on the website.

Ongoing improvement: our three-year action plan
Though we believe that we are already delivering effectively in clients’ interests, we recognise that there is a 
need to challenge ourselves towards constant improvement and that every ESG approach can be enhanced. 
Therefore in October 2018, Amundi adopted an ambitious three year action plan to increase our commitment 
to responsible investment.
Under this action plan, by the end of 2021:

How our structures support and enable ESG 
and stewardship work
As ESG is built in to the nature of Amundi and the service we offer to our clients, oversight of both ESG 
and stewardship runs from the very top of the organisation, including our CEO and other members of the 
executive leadership. ESG sits at the core of Amundi. In a very real sense, it is who we are: Amundi is both a 
responsible investment doer and a responsible investment enabler:

Jean-Jacques Barbéris, an Executive Director of Amundi and Director of the Institutional and Corporate Clients 
division & ESG, has overall responsibility for ESG and stewardship. We have made a deliberate effort in recent 
years to reinvigorate the management and oversight of ESG and stewardship. Élodie Laugel, a senior member 
of the investment team, was recently appointed Chief Responsible Investment Officer to lead our ESG efforts. 
In addition to her appointment in 2020, the following significant appointments have also been made recently: 
Timothée Jaulin, Head of ESG Advisory, Business Development and Advocacy (appointed 2020), Caroline 
Le Meaux as the Head of ESG Analysis, Engagement & Voting (appointed 2019); Tegwen Le Berthe as Head 
of ESG Scoring, Methodologies & Financial Engineering (appointed 2019); and Stéphane Taillepied as Head of 
Voting (appointed 2018). This broad refreshment leaves the team as follows:

In the last year,  we also made the decision to separate out the Responsible Investment team into an inde-
pendent business line separated from the investment department. As we hoped it would, this formal distancing 
has enabled us to ensure that relationships are strengthened across the whole business, and the responsible 
investment team is clearly available at the service of all business lines and across all investment platforms. 
As the organisation chart indicates, the responsible  ESG analysis team from the investment management

research,  engagement  and  voting;  and  advisory,  analysts work in close collaboration with Amundi’s 
development and advocacy.  The independence of the  portfolio management teams.
To provide formal oversight of our ESG and stewardship approach and its effectiveness, we have five key 
committees in place. These are monitored by Amundi’s CEO on a regular basis.
ESG Strategic Committee
Chaired by Amundi’s CEO, this committee approves and monitors Amundi’s ESG and climate strategy. It approves 
major strategic positioning of the Responsible Investment policy and monitors key strategic projects. The committee is 
responsible for:
–  Approving Amundi’s ESG and climate strategy
–  Approving the strategic positioning of the Responsible Investment policy (exclusion, engagement and voting policies)
–  Steering and monitoring the ESG 2021 ambition project
–  Deciding on issues escalated from the ESG Rating, Voting or Social Impact Committees

Resourcing of ESG: our team, training and skills
Our ambition that every open-ended fund should beat its benchmark in ESG terms means that we now expect 
all of our investment teams to integrate ESG and consider it actively, and all investment professionals are 
moving forwards to develop their skills and work to ensure they have the necessary insight to deliver on this 
expectation. They are supported in these efforts by a dedicated resource of 36 people in our global stewardship 
team. Of the 36 people in the stewardship team:

In addition to the standard calculation of ratings, an active and in-depth analysis is carried out on a number of 
issuers selected by the ESG analysts. Such coverage of a company can be triggered by:
– specific requests from portfolio managers;
– the overall level of exposure of Amundi to a given issuer;
– our annual engagement campaigns;
– issuers with a particularly weak ESG rating for a given criterion; and 
– the quarterly controversies screening.
The above approach to rating issuers applies independent of the instruments that are issued, whether equity 
or fixed income, and is therefore relevant to both asset classes. A similar approach is applied in a tailored 
way to other asset classes. For example, with regard to sovereign debt issuers, our approach again seeks to 
consider the main ESG issues to which an investor is exposed. We seek to assess the ESG issues embedded in 
governments’ current and past policies, which could be reflected in a country’s ability to reimburse its debt in 
the mid to long-term, and so thus represent a risk for investors. We also seek to assess how countries handle 
the major sustainability issues that contribute to the stability of global society. Our methodology relies on 
about 50 indices or factors, each of which represents one ESG issue. These are constructed from an external 
data provider which bases them on information from various sources including the World Bank and the UN as 
well as proprietary databases and expert scorecards. These are combined into an Amundi ESG sovereign index, 
grouped into eight categories under the pillars E, S and G:
Environment Social Governance
Climate Change Human Rights Government

In addition, Amundi applies specific sectoral exclusions to controversial industries: coal and tobacco. These 
sectoral exclusions apply to all actively managed strategies in which Amundi has full portfolio management 
discretion and always subject to applicable laws prohibiting their implementation. These apply unless clients 
specifically request otherwise in the context of individual mandates or tailored funds (or fully passive strategies):
Thermal Coal
The following companies are excluded from all active strategies:
– Any companies developing or planning to develop new thermal coal capacity along the entire value 
chain (mining, production, utilities and transport infrastructure).
– Companies generating more than 25% of their revenues from coal mining, or with annual coal 
extraction of 100 Mt or more, without having declared an intention to reduce this.
– Companies with revenues from coal mining and coal-fired electricity production equal to or greater 
than 50% of their total revenues.
– Coal-fired power generation and coal mining companies with revenue between these thresholds of 
25% and 50% which do not have an improving energy transition score.
Tobacco
As a signatory of the Tobacco Free Finance Pledge, in 2020 we further strengthened our tobacco exclusion 
policy. This applies as follows:
– We exclude any investment in companies that manufacture complete tobacco products (applying a 
revenue threshold of 5%).
– We cap our ESG rating of an issuer with more than 10% of its turnover from tobacco (this includes 
suppliers, manufacturers and distributors) at E. As a result, such companies are excluded from our SRI 
funds range, which is historically subject to the exclusion of issuers rated E, F or G.

The risk department oversees adherence to regulatory requirements and management of risks related to these 
topics, as well as monitoring adherence to ESG constraints (whether exclusions or other rules) within mandates

Active and value-focused engagement
Amundi engages issuers regardless of the asset class through which we have investment exposure to the 
business. The issuers with which we engage are primarily chosen based on the extent of their exposure 
to the relevant engagement issue. As a global investor (see map of investments), we engage across the 
world, taking account of local realities but with the same level of ambition and gradual expectations across

We regard divestment as a last resort. By divesting, an asset manager gives up any opportunity to exert

Collaborative engagement 
Collective efforts can often have a greater impact. Just as we encourage issuers to act collectively on key 
sustainability issues, investors also often collaborate. Collaborative initiatives can provide additional scope for 
engagement or provide opportunities for greater impact. 
We highlight here examples of our collective engagement activities (beyond those already referenced under 
thematic engagements), where we work actively with other institutional investors through formal and informal 
groupings to influence change at issuers. In some cases, we take leading roles in specific engagements, while 
in others it is a better use of our overall resources simply to lend our support to activities. We typically prefer 
to play an active role, generally meaning that Amundi takes the role of lead investor to engage with one or 
more companies. By contrast, occasionally, we are simply a participant in a collective initiative, often where the 
initiative is dynamic and impactful without particular direct assistance other than lending our support.

Escalated engagement 
On occasions, it is necessary to escalate engagement with companies through a number of more powerful 
tools such as making concerns public, proposing shareholder resolutions, litigation, divestment and exclusion 
from the active investment universe. We use each of these tools only sparingly, because most use significant 
resources, and for us divestment is a last resort. However, retaining the option to escalate plays an important 
part in our ability fully to influence issuers. The following are a sample of our escalated activities.

Application of voting approach
This voting approach applies to all Amundi managed funds, apart from some whose overall value is less than 
€15 million, because we have concluded that the costs of voting on such funds outweigh the benefit to clients. 
In the same way, voting rights are exercised on the entirety of the shares held, unless the required period during 
which trading is blocked by the market or custodian risks an adverse impact on our clients because it would 
hinder portfolio manager trading discretion. Exceptionally, we may not be able to ensure effective voting for 
some or all of the shares held.

apply their own voting policy, subject to an agreement 
Examples of our voting are below:
Chevron Corporation (US)
We recognise that governments will play the key role in setting the trajectory for a carbon-constrained world 
and that companies on their own cannot determine whether the goals of the Paris Agreement are met. However, 
this makes it particularly important that companies are careful in their approach to lobbying on these issues 
so that they are not seen to hinder governments from taking appropriate decisions. A number of European oil 
and gas majors have severed ties with certain trade associations because of this, among them AFPM (American 
Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers). Chevron remains a member of this organization and has no clear policy to 
constrain lobbying on climate, and so we voted in favour of a shareholder resolution encouraging alignment of the 
company’s lobbying activities with the Paris Agreement.
Deutsche Bank (Germany)
Having voted against the discharges of both the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in 2019, because 
of concerns about excessive remuneration and its disconnection from the economic and financial performance 
of the bank (there being no resolution more relevant to remuneration matters), we held active dialogue with 
the company twice in 2020. First, before the AGM we discussed the forthcoming resolutions, and pressed for 
an evolution of the compensation policy, not least by integrating ESG criteria into variable pay. We spoke to the 
bank a second time at the end of 2020 to discuss a proposed new remuneration policy, which will be brought 
forward for approval at the 2021 AGM. We welcomed the move in integrate ESG: ESG criteria (including diversity 
and climate-related KPIs) will influence up to 20% of long-term variable remuneration. We also welcomed moves 
to make pay ratio disclosures in 2021.
Fortum (Finland)
Following the acquisition of Uniper, Fortum faces greater climate change transition risks as the deal substantially 
increased its exposure to fossil fuels (including lignite, coal and natural gas). A large share of Fortum’s fossil fuel 
based generation is concentrated in Russia, where decarbonisation may prove challenging; notably, Fortum 
has no decarbonisation strategy or relevant targets for that market. Because of the deal and the lack of a 
clear plan to phase out coal aligned with the Paris Agreement, we participated in a collective engagement 
with company, including a dialogue directly with the CEO to discuss the strategy for emissions reduction. To 
reflect and reinforce our continuing concerns, we voted in favour of a resolution seeking the inclusion of a Paris 
Agreement compliant 1.5 degree Celsius target as part of Fortum’s Articles of Association.
40 | Stewardship Report 2020
JP Morgan (US)
We engaged the US bank regarding its climate change strategy, which we believe lags behind industry peers. 
Even though JP Morgan indicated that it was considering what its next steps ought to be, we did not gain 
confidence that the bank was likely to announce ambitious targets in the near term. We therefore took the 
decision to vote in favour of two shareholder proposals put before the AGM: the first seeking a policy on 
lending to unconventional oil and gas businesses, and the second calling on the bank to establish a target for 
emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement.
Macquarie Group (Australia)
We voted against the remuneration report at this Australian financial institution. Amundi calls for executive 
pay that is ‘reasonable’ and fully aligned with shareholder and also stakeholder interests, including being 
‘acceptable’ from a societal perspective. Given that the proposed annual base salary of the CEO amount to a 
10% increase over the prior year, and CEO pay is more than two times the median CEO pay at peers, we do not 
believe that these standards are being respected.
Microsoft Corporation (US)
We voted in favour of a shareholder resolution calling for a report into employee representation on the board. 
This reflects our general view in support of employee involvement in corporate governance and employee share 
ownership, because these practices help align the interests of shareholders and employees over the long term. 
Swedbank (Sweden) 
We felt it necessary to vote against the discharge of board members at Swedbank following the Baltic money 
laundering scandal. The Swedish FSA had concluded that the board members failed to keep themselves 
sufficiently informed about the Baltic operations and didn’t request the information they would have needed 
to understand the risks of money laundering there. Given the reputational and business cost of this failure, we 
were clear that the board needed to be held accountable. 
Television Broadcasts (Hong Kong)
In a pre-AGM alert to the company we clearly stated that our voting intentions were not in favor of the dividend 
resolution. TVB was proposing a dividend even though it had made a net loss in both 2019 and 2018, and we 
were strongly of the view (particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic) that dividends should be paid only 
if the company’s financial strength was maintained, in the interests of shareholders, employees and other 
stakeholders. Following dialogue we were unable to gain comfort that the dividend was appropriate and 
maintained our negative vote on the proposal.
Walmart (US)
We were pleased to vote in support of a shareholder resolution seeking a report on supplier antibiotics use 
standards. We recognise the importance of controls on antibiotic use in the farming sector, given the risk it 
poses of creating antibiotic resistance – a major emerging health concern. As one of the largest buyers of meat 
products in the world, Walmart has scope to be significantly influential on this issue. As the proposal would 
enable shareholders to assess how the company’s policy on the matter operates, and also to flag up investor 
concern about the issue, we felt support for the resolution was warranted.

Promoting long-termism in markets
As a responsible investor with a clear understanding of the role and importance of ESG criteria, Amundi 
participates in numerous initiatives as a member and signatory. We are an active participant in working groups 
at a range of market bodies – both regulatory and industry-led organisations – aimed at moving responsible 
finance, sustainable development and corporate governance forward in the interests of our clients.
These international initiatives include institutional investors and asset management professionals. Their goal is 
to encourage businesses to improve their practices and transparency in the fields of fighting climate change 
and deforestation, protecting water resources, health, nutrition in developing countries, and so on. We actively 
participate in the development of standards and initiatives where we believe the additional effort will be 
important to client outcomes, and lend our weight to other initiatives where we feel this is the most positive 
contribution we can make.

EU Green Bond Standard
As part of our broader work in fostering the development of green bond markets, we have been actively 
participating in the EU work to develop a green bond standard. To encourage the development of the market 
we are arguing for voluntary application of any standard that is developed to enable a range of different 
products to be offered to investors. We believe that to qualify, a bond should maintain its status through to 
maturity. Further, we would welcome alignment of the standard with the broader EU sustainable investment 
taxonomy, though we recognise the challenges that this may pose.
EFRAG lab task force
The task force began its work in September 2020, preparing the ground for a significant enhancement of EU 
non-financial reporting standards. Our involvement allows us to seek greater coherence among the current 
wide range of reporting standards in this area, and to press for much more consistency between the reporting 
of financial and non-financial matters. 
ICMA Sustainability-Linked Bonds Principles
Following the substantial efforts of the working group of which Amundi is a member, the International Capital 
Market Association released its first Sustainability-Linked Bonds Principles in June 2020. These aim to extend 
the concept of green bonds to also encompass the financing of social impacts. By requiring transparency and 
a verification process we hope that the principles will build investor confidence in these instruments and so 
enable increased capital allocations to such investments – and their end benefits.

Fondation de la Mer: promoting greater corporate reporting on Ocean impacts and SDG 14 
One aspect of Amundi’s overall work on biodiversity is specifically Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, 
‘Life Below Water’. Oceans face many threats including climate change, acidification, pollution (including 
plastic pollution), overfishing, destruction of marine biodiversity, and so on. Yet SDG 14 is among those least 
prioritised by businesses worldwide. We regard preserving the oceans and their biodiversity as a key part of 
addressing biodiversity loss and climate change. 
This is why, in 2019, we started a close collaboration with the Fondation de la Mer (FDLM). The FDLM is a 
French NGO that works with civil society including sailors, corporates, scientists, and investment institutions 
to help protect marine ecosystems, fight pollution, support ocean-related research, encourage innovation, 
and educate audiences on protecting the oceans. FDLM is working actively in collaboration with the French 
Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition to help corporates better assess their impact on the ocean. 
We actively participated in the development of the methodology, both in its initial design and by engaging with 
French corporates, encouraging them to participate to test the approach.
We are now working to promote the framework further to companies. We will also begin using the framework 
on selected corporates to begin impact assessments pertaining to SDG 14.

30% Club
The 30% Club is a global campaign to take action to increase gender diversity at board and senior management 
levels. The campaign was launched in the UK in 2010 when women represented just 12% of FTSE 100 boards; 
30% was set as an aspirational target and it was confirmed by research that 30% represents a critical mass 
form which point minority groups can impact boardroom dynamics. The target is a floor not a ceiling with the 
ultimate goal to strive overall for a more equitable gender and diversity balance. Companies should address 
imbalances in their talent pipelines and strategies to drive long-term progress and this ultimately must come 
from top management.
We share the 30% Club belief that gender balance on boards and senior management encourages better 
leadership and governance. We also believe that diversity and inclusion further contribute to all-round board 
performance and ultimately enhance business performance. This is why we participated in the creation of the 
French chapter in 2020. 
The French investor group has two main early objectives:
– conduct a soft email engagement campaign with the SBF 120 to communicate the launch of the initiative 
and investor expectations on gender diversity; 
– launch an engagement campaign targeted at the top 15 ‘worst offenders’ in the CAC40. 
These engagements, which started in 2020 and will continue in 2021, cover why this initiative was set up, what 
the initiative’s expectations are for each company, and seek clarity on what the company’s current efforts are 
to address its gender imbalance. 
CDP Forest Engagement Campaign
Organisations like CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) can help provide a starting point to assess 
corporate performance on key sustainability issues. Pushing for further collaboration with experts such as 
through the CDP Forest survey is for Amundi a key way to encourage companies to find solutions to biodiversity 
reporting until a clear standard emerges. CDP Forests provides a framework for companies to measure and 
manage forest-related risks and opportunities, transparently report on progress, and commit to proactive 
action for the restoration of forests and ecosystems.
We started an engagement campaign to encourage companies with large deforestation exposures (according 
to Forest500 and Canopy), encouraging 32 companies to make disclosures to CDP Forest. So far, the response 
rate has not been what we have hoped so going forward in 2021, we will commence deeper engagement on 
the topic of limited biodiversity disclosure including further engagement to push for increased reporting as 
part of CDP Forest.
