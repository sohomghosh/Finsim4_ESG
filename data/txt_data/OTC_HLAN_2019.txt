4 PERFORMANCE & EXCELLENCE
Another Year of Achievement
2019 marked yet another consecutive year of strong, consistent financial performance for Heartland BancCorp. Net income for 2019 increased 
16% to $13.2 million, or $6.45, per diluted share. This compares to earnings of $11.4 million, or $6.68, per diluted share in 2018. Return on average 
assets and equity were 1.21% and 10.81% respectively for 2019, compared to 1.16% and 13.15% for 2018. Operating results were driven by solid 
loan and deposit growth, net interest margin expansion, and higher noninterest income. Growth of 9% in loan balances and 10% in demand 
deposit balances drove a $4.4 million, or 12%, increase in net interest income. A favorable shift in earning asset mix, including higher loans-
to-deposits, along with strong growth in non-interest DDA balances lead to an increase in net interest margin to 3.94% for 2019 compared to 
3.90% in 2018. Loan loss provision expense remained flat at $1.5 million for 2019 and 2018, reflecting excellent asset quality and strong loan 
portfolio management. Non-interest income growth was fueled by an increase in loan sales and servicing revenue from residential, agriculture, 
and commercial participation lending segments, up $696 thousand, or 50%, compared to 2018; and by an increase in income from Trans County 
Title Agency, up $1.6 million to $2.1 million for 2019. Finally, Heartland’s efficiency ratio of 63.48% for 2019, reflects the company’s investment in 
talent acquisition, branch expansion and diversification to support continued solid and consistent growth. Heartland’s performance reflects the 
strength and commitment of our board of directors, and quality of the Heartland team.

6 GROWING & COMMITTING
Welcome to the Heartland Family...
Upper Arlington Grand Opening
Opening in April of 2019, Heartland’s Upper Arlington branch and 16th 
location is proudly situated on a prime spot anchoring West Lane Avenue 
and Northwest Boulevard. The branch is a corner friendly, two-story with 
a brownstone-reminiscent exterior, architectural presence and unique 
style. The first level is occupied by the bank, and the second level houses 
our Heartland Planning Associates team. 
As Heartland has been committed to increasing its Central Ohio footprint 
over the last several years, the quaint community of Upper Arlington, 
positioned just northwest of downtown Columbus, was a natural choice. 
With easy access from The Ohio State University, Grandview Heights, 
Short North and downtown, this Heartland Bank branch offers top-notch 
technology and a modern interior design splashed with a hint Heartland’s 
rustic roots.
With the close of a successful year in 2019, Heartland Bank is confident 
that its small corner of Upper Arlington will bring lasting relationships and 
continuing partnerships within this vibrant and timeless neighborhood.

be able to make contributions to nonprofit organizations to fund widespread 
community impact programs and/or projects.  The Foundation is part of 
Heartland’s overall charitable giving initiative, which will enable the bank to 
support programs that improve quality of life throughout the state of Ohio, 
where our clients and associates live and work.  
The Foundation will support four areas of impact aligning with the mission and 
vision of the HBCF: Community & Civic Development, Education & Financial 
Literacy, Health & Welfare and Youth & Families. This focus allows the Foundation

12 A FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE
Celebrating our first year at 
Heartland Bank’s Corporate Center
Power Breakfast with Kenny McDonald 
Guest speaker Kenny McDonald, president and 
chief economic officer for One Columbus (formally 
Columbus 2020), joined Power Breakfast attendees for 
a morning of food and facts – he provided the facts 
and Heartland provided the food!
Kenny shared the outlook for the 11-county Columbus 
Region along with his thoughts on building on the 
success of the past decade. As the primary leader of 
all economic development and business attraction 
efforts, he was a great source for sharing the new 
standard in economic development in Central Ohio.
 Business First Top Women Networking Group
In October, Heartland was proud to host the October reception for the Business 
First Top Women Networking Group. It was an evening of camaraderie and crafts, 
culminating with a black cat made of pumpkins as a take home gift. Attendees had 
the pleasure of checking out our new home while networking with professionals 
from across the city. 
Volunteers from the commercial lending department joined forces to provide an 
evening to remember!
 Agribusiness Power Luncheon
Heartland’s Agribusiness department hosted an 
Ohio Agriculture Power Luncheon on December 
11th focusing on a discussion of industrial hemp 
as an emerging Ohio commodity. Guest speakers 
were Joel Oney, manager of agribusiness banking at 
Heartland; Greg Lyons, economist at Farmer Mac; and 
David Miran, director of industrial hemp for the Ohio 
Department of Agriculture.
The discussions highlighted current and historical 
financial performance levels of the farming 
industry, the emerging hemp market along with 
the opportunities and issues that accompany this 
commodity, and real-time updates resulting from an 
audience question/answer session. 
 YMCA campaign kickoff for Whitehall
In 2019, Heartland Bank welcomed the Whitehall Community Park YMCA to the 
block as they became an official inhabitant of the Whitehall Community Park located 
in the backyard of the Heartland Bank Corporate Center. This YMCA is the result of a 
partnership between the YMCA of Central Ohio and the City of Whitehall. 
Heartland BancCorp donated $50,000 as one of two lead gifts for the park’s YMCA 
campaign for furniture and equipment for the new space. One hundred percent 
of the donation will be used to help offset initial start-up costs. The new YMCA will 
focus on unique youth programming as well as health and wellness initiatives for 
youth, adults, and families. 
 Economic Forum
In February, Heartland Bank held its annual Economic Forecast for 
2019 at the Grand Event Center in Grandview Yard. This informational 
luncheon was presented in partnership with Overmyer Hall Associates 
and Heartland Planning Associates. Ryan Detrick, VP and market 
strategist, from the tactical asset allocation committee at LPL Financial 
Research was the guest speaker. He discussed emerging and developing 
market trends within the current economic environment. 
With ancillary presentations from Scott McComb and Greg Overmyer, 
attendees were also given the opportunity to mingle with Heartland 
bankers, Overmyer Hall associates and other peers and professionals 
from the Central Ohio area.
