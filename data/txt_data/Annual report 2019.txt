measures to keep employees fit and offer other medical

regular health checkups Bank-wide, and almost 100% of 
eligible employees have their checkup every year. The 
Office offers follow-up care and specific health guidance

(3) Valuation technique used for valuing the fair value of stock options
Stock options for FY2018 granted in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing 
model.
The principal parameters and estimation methods were as follows:
Stock options for FY2018
Expected volatility (Note 1)･･･････････････････････････････ 18.8%
Average expected life (Note 2)････････････････････････････ 2 years
Expected dividends (Note 3)･･････････････････････････････ ¥184 ($1.7) per share
Risk-free interest rate (Note 4)････････････････････････････ 0.12% negative
Notes: 1. Expected volatility is calculated based on the actual price of common stock of the Bank on each trading day from July 4, 2016 to July 9, 2018.
2. Average expected life could not be estimated rationally due to insufficient amount of data. It was estimated based on average tenures of the 
Bank’s directors.
3. Expected dividends are estimated based on the actual dividends on common stock paid for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
4. Japanese national government bond yield applicable to the average expected life.
F
in
an (4) Method of estimating the number of stock options vested

l a

Notes: 1. Valuation allowance increased by ¥6,162 million from March 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to the tax loss 
carryforwards assessed as not recoverable.
2. The amount of tax loss carryforwards is multiplied by the normal effective statutory tax rate.
3. Of the tax loss carryforward of the ¥19,740 million ($177,844 thousand) (multiplied by the effective statutory tax rate), 
the Group recorded deferred tax assets of ¥262 million ($2,364 thousand) as of March 31, 2019. Valuation allowances 
are provided for the portion of tax loss carryforwards that are judged not to be recoverable.
4. The Bank applied the ’Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting’ from Article 3 to 5 and 
relevant Guidances from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The contents related to the fiscal year 
ended March 31, 2018, were not stated, with respect to the transitional treatment by ‘Partial Amendments to

interest income and interest expense for the management purposes, therefore, revenue in transactions between reportable segments is not 
disclosed.

aggregated with other general and administrative expenses. Therefore, depreciation expenses by reportable segment are not managed

Notes: 1. Deposits include negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs).
2. In addition to the existing preferred dividend of ¥5.952 per share for ‘Dividends per share,’ the Bank paid a ¥20,490 million super preferred 
dividend from other capital surplus on the remaining Class C Series 5 preferred stock for the year ended March 31, 2015.
Dividend per share of the super preferred dividend is calculated by dividing total dividends of ¥20,490 million by 214,579 thousand shares of 
Class C Series 5 preferred stock as of March 31, 2015.
3. The Bank fully repaid the remaining public funds on June 29, 2015 through a buyback of Class A Series 4 preferred stock and Class C Series 5 
preferred stock, for cancellation. Therefore, for the 1st quarter of FY2015 and thereafter, there will be no dividend payment on those preferred 
shares.
4. The Bank consolidated every ten common shares into one common share on October 1,2017. ‘Total equity per share,’ ‘Basic net income per 
share’ and ‘Diluted net income per share’ are presented as if the share consolidation was effective at the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 
31, 2017.
5. The Bank consolidated every ten common shares into one common share on October 1, 2017. ‘Common stock dividends per share’ of FY2017 
(184 yen) is presented as if the share consolidation was effective at the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The dividend payments 
for the 1st quarter end and the 2nd quarter end of FY2017 are actual amounts before the share consolidation, and those for the 3rd quarter end 
and year-end are actual amounts after the share consolidation.
6. Number of employees includes executive officers and locally hired overseas staff, but excludes the Bank’s employees seconded to other firms.
7. Due to the transfer of the trust business operations from GMO Aozora Net Bank, Ltd., to the Bank on October 1, 2018, ‘Trust fees’, ‘Trust assets’, 
‘Loans and bills discounted (Trust account)’ and ‘Securities (Trust account)’ are added from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, going forward. 
‘Trust assets’ is assets in trust pertaining to trust business under the Act on Engagement in Trust Business by a Financial Institution (the 
Concurrent Business Act).

(As of March 31, 2019)
Item Common Stock
Issuing entity Aozora Bank
Amounts included in core capital ¥187,377 million
3. Outline of capital adequacy assessment method
The Bank manages its capital based on ‘risk capital,’ namely economic capital, in order to control the size of its business within 
its intended scope and secure sufficient capital to match the risk it faces.  We assess our capital adequacy by comparing the 
amounts of total capital for the fiscal year and risk capital usage in which actual risk profile is reflected, and thus confirming that 
an adequate amount of capital for the risk is secured.
  　Such assessment is also made from the perspective of whether the Bank can maintain sufficient capital to cover the effects 
of the estimated impact of a loss assumed in a stress-testing on the Bank’s capital position and ensure the continuous operation 
from the following fiscal year onwards, and secure the required capital adequacy ratio. The status of risk capital is reported to 
the senior management on an approximately monthly basis.

(Guarantees/CDS)
Type and creditworthiness of counterparty
Guarantees We individually judge the creditworthiness of the guarantor or the necessity of obtaining a proof 
thereof.
We use a guarantee transaction as a credit risk mitigation contingent on the following:
1. The risk weight of the guarantor must be lower than that of the borrower.
2. The guarantor must be a sovereign or financial institution.
3. If a guarantor is not a sovereign or financial institution, the Bank will use the rating of the guarantor 
assigned by eligible ratings agencies for the judgment of risk weight.
CDS The providers of protection in CDS transactions mainly consist of domestic and overseas financial 
institutions, and we judge the creditworthiness of the protection provider individually.
When a CDS transaction is used as a credit risk mitigation, we set the minimum requirement of 
meeting the prerequisites of a guarantee as stated above.

2. Items pertaining to assessing the validity of the design and implementation of the remuneration framework for 
Aozora Group’s ‘officers and employees’
Remuneration policy
(a) Remuneration policy for ‘officers’ covered herein
The remuneration for officers basically consists of the base remuneration (fixed remuneration), bonus and Equity Compensation 
Type Stock Options for internal directors (full-time directors) and solely of base remuneration (fixed remuneration) for outside 
directors as well as ASB members. The base remuneration is determined by checking the appropriate level based on the 
research data obtained by engaging a dedicated third-party institution. The amount of bonus is determined based on achieved 
performance and the standard amounts set per position and responsibilities. The value granted as Equity Compensation Type 
Stock Options are determined at an appropriate level by the NRC based on discussions on the proportion of cash remuneration 
and equity compensation type stock options so as to function as sound incentives towards sustainable growth.
(b) Remuneration policy for ‘employees’ covered herein
Remuneration for the Bank’s employees and its main consolidated subsidiaries’ officers and employees is determined based on 
an evaluation of their performance which reflects their contribution to the business results.
The Bank’s HR Division confirms that the Bank and its main consolidated subsidiaries do not depend too heavily on ‘pay for 
performance’ in the remuneration of the Bank’s employees and its main consolidated subsidiaries’ officers and employees, by 
checking the remuneration framework, performance evaluation status and actual remunerations.
