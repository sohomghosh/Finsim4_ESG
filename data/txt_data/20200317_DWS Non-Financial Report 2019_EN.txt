Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
1  Statement by the Management  
[GRI 102-14] 
 
The call for action has never been bigger or bolder than it was in 2019. It was a year that activists spoke louder and 
environmental movements grew faster as climate change continued to devastate our planet. As a society, our awareness of 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues has risen to new highs – along with our urgency to do something about it. 
This sense of responsibility is felt strongly at DWS. We know that in the current state of affairs, it is unacceptable to sit back and 
do nothing. We must step up and lead the way, both as a fiduciary asset manager and as a corporate citizen, to contribute 
towards a more sustainable economy, help safeguard the environment and the achievements of equal rights and opportunities for 
future generations. 
Our stakeholders, clients and colleagues also expect this from us. At our first Annual General Meeting, we listened closely as 
shareholders voiced their hopes – and concerns – for DWS, with a strong sentiment that we must do even more to act 
responsibly. Our dialogue with clients has also shifted towards engagement, sustainable investing and climate transition risks, 
reflecting the growing importance of sustainability in the financial services sector. And internally our employees, especially the 
younger generation, have been challenging myself and other senior managers to exert our influence and encourage more 
conscious corporate behaviour.  
Let me assure you, the DWS Executive Board and I are working harder and faster to respond to all the demands rightfully 
expected from us. In 2019, we had a clear priority; to return our business to a positive trajectory after a challenging 2018, which 
we achieved with great success as reflected in our strong financial performance. In 2020, we have a bolder priority; to embed 
ESG into everything we do, as this will be the license to operate for fiduciary investors in the future – and we intend to be among 
the leaders of the movement. 
To ensure we can deliver on this ambition, we have spent a lot of time developing our sustainability strategy in 2019. We agreed 
a new organizational set-up to manage sustainability across DWS; we are implementing ‘Smart Integration’ to increase our 
consideration of ESG criteria in the investment process and enhance our engagement activities; we have continued to build-out 
our global ESG product suite; and in 2020, we will continue to integrate ESG standards into all of our corporate processes. This 
also includes enhancing our risk management framework, and introducing new sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) to 
make sure that we track meaningful progress on delivering our commitments. 
While we are pleased with all of our progress so far, we know we have so much more to do. In this year’s Sustainability Report, 
we have taken greater attention to report on topics that are not just relevant to DWS as a business, but which could also have an 
impact on selected UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have also included content on our impact on climate 
change, as we aim to provide more transparent disclosure on issues that will help us, and our stakeholders, understand what we 
can do to make DWS an asset manager for the better. 
We are very much aware that this path towards sustainability will include a huge learning curve. As a traditional financial services 
firm, we are still learning to adapt to growing demand for non-financial data, a trend that is likely to continue as regulators also 
come under pressure to focus more on ESG.   
At DWS, we are working as one global team to ensure we have the right products, policies and people in place to become the 
leading ESG-integrated asset manager of the future. We realize that this ambition cannot be achieved overnight, but in 2020, we 
will work hard to get a good head start. 
Yours

2  About this Report 
[GRI 102-1; 102-45; 102-49; 102-50; 102-51; 102-52; 102-54; 102-55; 102-56] 
This is our second Sustainability Report since our partial Initial Public Offering (IPO) providing insights on developments from 
January to December 2019. The next report including our separate non-financial group report will be published in March 2021. 
DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA (hereafter referred to as “DWS KGaA” or the “Parent”; the group of companies of which DWS 
KGaA is the parent are referred to as the “DWS Group”) is obligated to comply with the requirements on non-financial reporting 
(Art. 340a (1a) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB)). With this separate non-financial group report, DWS 
KGaA hereby satisfies this requirement pursuant to Art. 340i (5) in conjunction with Art. 315b (3) and Art. 289c to 289e of the 
German Commercial Code. In order to position DWS Group as a standalone asset manager with an expressed focus on 
sustainability we do not make use of the option of exemption by virtue of the non-financial report of Deutsche Bank according to 
Art. 315b (2) German Commercial Code. This separate non-financial group report (Non-Financial Report) is published as a 
supplement to the annual report of DWS KGaA. 
We embedded the Non-Financial Report according to HGB in the Sustainability Report. The mandatory non-financial information 
according to HGB which together build the Non-Financial Report are marked by a black line. An overview of all material topics 
according to HGB and a mapping of the material topics relating to the reporting content are presented in the supplementary 
information. These non-financial topics were identified as material to understand the development of the business, the business 
results and the position of DWS KGaA, as well as necessary to understand the impacts of our activities on these aspects. Unless 
stated otherwise, the information in this report relates to DWS Group. The consolidation approach of this report is in line with the 
DWS KGaA consolidated group financial statements.  
Information referred to on external websites or documents is marked as “additional information” and is not part of the Non-Financial 
Report. Our auditor KPMG performed a limited assurance engagement on the Non-Financial Report marked by a black line in 
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised). This Independent Practitioner’s 
Report can be found in the supplementary information. 
Non-financial risks are monitored through dedicated risk frameworks and processes. A more detailed description of our risk 
management can be found in the risk report within the summarized management report 2019. After application of the net method 
to determine risks subject to disclosure according to HGB, there are no net risks that are highly probable and that result or will result 
in severe adverse impacts on the reported aspects. Reportable relations to the amounts of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
have not been determined. 
In order to determine the reporting contents for this Sustainability Report, we have used both Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as guiding frameworks. Together, these have helped 
guide our reporting on management approaches as well as the specific Standard Titles, which are also included in the GRI content 
index. In this context, the Sustainability Report has been completed partially in accordance with the GRI Standards. Information in 
the text referring to specific GRI standards is marked accordingly with a reference to the respective GRI standard and summarized 
in the GRI index. 
This Sustainability Report containing Non-Financial Report 2019 is also available in German, which is the binding and leading 
document.

2.2  Scope of this Report 
[GRI 102-2; 102-5; 102-7; 102-10; 102-45; 102-50] 
DWS KGaA has its registered office in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. DWS Group is a global asset manager covering a diverse 
offering that spans traditional asset classes (i.e. active and passive strategies) as well as alternatives strategies and bespoke 
solutions with a global footprint and – through our branch network, our subsidiaries, our majority shareholder Deutsche Bank 
Group’s distribution network and distribution partners - a scalable presence in key asset and wealth management markets.

consolidated subsidiaries, including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit. This report covers the 
activities during the fiscal year 2019 (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019) for DWS Group, unless otherwise stated.  
Whenever this report refers to DWS Group’s brand, the reference to “DWS” will be made. Throughout this report we will use 
references to Deutsche Bank AG (our majority shareholder) in order to explain applicable policies and processes by stating 
“Deutsche Bank Group” and “DB Group” interchangeably.

2.3  Materiality Assessment for 2019 
[GRI 102-44; 102-46; 102-47] 
Following the publication of our first non-financial report in 2018, we have taken a more comprehensive approach to better define 
the scope of our Sustainability Report for 2019. This year, we have continued to consider the opinions of our stakeholders in 
addition to enriching our materiality assessment process by analysing our impacts on the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) for the first time. 
As a German-listed asset manager, our materiality assessment is primarily guided by the legal requirements of the German 
Commercial Code and the international sustainability reporting standards of the GRI. 
Additionally, we continue to assess external sources, expanding the range of industry topics discussed by professional 
associations and non-governmental organisations, and extending our competitor analyses to include a wider peer set.  
Once this research had been concluded, we engaged subject matter experts across the company to measure the business 
relevance of the proposed topics. This group of experts were selected to represent a cross-divisional perspective of DWS, 
including the views of internal and external stakeholders. We asked the experts to participate in a survey to consider and score 
the relevance of these topics to DWS as an asset management business, with the findings of the survey discussed and agreed as 
a group before being shared with the Group Executive Board for final approval. 
For the first time, we also analysed our impacts on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by mapping the agreed 
topics to a number of selected SDGs, allowing us to consider the business relevance of these topics in the context of an external 
framework. The assessment was also valuable to understand how DWS can commit to becoming more sustainable and have a 
tangible impact through its business as a fiduciary investment manager, as well as its responsibilities as corporate citizen. After a 
thorough diagnosis, we measured DWS’ impact against pre-analysed SDG targets based on three key criteria: likelihood, 
influence and magnitude of impact. This analysis considered both the positive and negative impacts that DWS could have on 
these goals, with the final scores indicating three SDGs where DWS can have the greatest impact: SDG 8, “Decent Work and 
Economic Growth;” SDG 10, “Reduced Inequalities” and SDG 13, “Climate Action”.  
Once these steps of our analysis had been finalized, we were able to consolidate our findings into our materiality matrix. The 
topics mapped inside of the box / top quadrant are considered material according to German Commercial Code (HGB). All of 
these topics are also material according to GRI, in addition to all of the topics outside of the box / top quadrant including; 
Business Continuity, Business Ethics, Carbon Emissions & Impact on Climate Change, Diversity & Equal Opportunities, 
Employee Wellbeing, Fiduciary Responsibility, Human Rights Assessment, Indirect Economic Impacts, Innovation, Lobbying and 
Risk Management. 
Altogether, the research process, engagement with subject matter experts and impact analysis, enabled us to conduct a 
comprehensive materiality assessment to establish a solid foundation for the Sustainability Report 2019. Additionally, our analysis 
of the UN’s SDGs has given us a framework to embed ESG more deeply into our company DNA. We aim to reflect this in our 
Corporate Responsibility Strategy, which we are currently in the process of developing to address the sub-targets of our identified 
SDGs including how we tackle climate change, expand access to financial services and create equal opportunities for all.

3.1  Corporate Profile 
[GRI 102-2; 102-3; 102-4; 102-6; 102-7; 102-8; 102-9; 102-16] 
We are a leading asset manager with € 767 billion in assets under management (AuM) as at December 31, 2019. We are 
headquartered in Germany but our approximately 3,360 employees operate globally, providing a range of traditional and 
alternative investment capabilities to clients worldwide.  
We have a fully integrated global investment group, supported by our Chief Investment Office which supplies the overarching 
framework that guides our investment decisions. Our offerings span all major asset classes including equity, fixed income, cash 
and multi asset as well as alternative investments. Our alternative investments include real estate, infrastructure, private equity, 
liquid real assets and sustainable investments. We also offer a range of passive investments. In addition, our solution strategies 
are targeted to client needs that cannot be addressed by traditional asset classes alone. Such services include insurance and 
pension solutions, asset-liability management, portfolio management solutions, asset allocation advisory, structuring and overlay. 
Our product offerings are distributed across EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), the Americas and Asia/Pacific (APAC) 
through our single global distribution network. We also leverage third-party distribution channels, including our largest 
shareholder Deutsche Bank Group. While we aim to grow organically, we will continue to monitor the market for selective bolt-on 
opportunities to grow in priority areas, for example to complement our product range and our platform capabilities. We may 
consider consolidation opportunities prevailing in the industry, to establish our market positions in key growth areas, or for 
distribution access. Any merger and acquisition activity, in addition to meeting strategic objectives and low execution risk, will also 
be measured against financial criteria such as attractive return on investment (ROI) and earnings accretion. 
We serve a diverse client base of retail and institutional investors worldwide, with a strong presence in our home market in 
Germany. These clients include large institutions to governments, corporations and foundations as well as millions of individual 
investors. As a regulated asset manager, we act as a fiduciary for our clients and we are conscious of our societal impact. 
Responsible Investing has been a key part of our heritage for more than twenty years, because it serves the best interests of 
those who entrust us to manage their assets. 
For further information on our business model please refer to the summarised management report in our 2019 Annual Report.

3.1.3  Our Brand 
[GRI 102-2; 102-16] 
The company brand ‘DWS’ draws on our roots in the German market, going back over 60 years, and uses a name that is distinct 
in our industry globally. It stands for stability, a strong track record and for values that we attribute to the DWS brand and 
continuously aim to live up to: integrity, entrepreneurship, excellence, and sustainability. These are values that will remain central 
to our future success. 
3.1.4  Our Values 
[GRI 102-16] 
Integrity first 
Openness, transparency and accountability must define every relationship, whether with colleagues, investors, or society as a 
whole. In tandem, clients’ best interests should always take precedence. This is how lasting value is created and how wealth is 
protected and grown. 
Entrepreneurial minds 
Many investors have an entrepreneurial outlook. The people they trust to look after their investments should share that 
perspective. Innovation, adaptability, agility, efficiency and collective intelligence are hallmarks of success, especially amid the 
risks and opportunities of an ever-changing world. 
Demanding excellence 
Expectations shall be exceeded rather than merely met. To achieve this, we strive for excellence in everything we do. Our fully 
integrated investment platform based on outstanding proprietary research, a unique precise decision-making process are the core 
components for us to apply this principle.

Inspiring sustainability 
Forward thinking demands a long-term view - and a sense of consciousness and responsibility for the society we are part of. The 
long heritage of integrating our Responsible Investment (RI) philosophy across all asset classes demonstrates our conviction to 
contribute to a sustainable future by incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into investment 
decisions. 
3.2  Sustainability Roadmap 
[GRI 102-16; 102-20; 102-31; FS8] 
In light of the natural disasters in 2019, such as wildfires in the Amazon region, Siberia, and Australia, we have seen a paradigm 
shift in public sentiment. The sense of urgency to act on climate change has visibly increased. This also fuelled the discourse in 
the financial industry around related risks and opportunities and the responsibility of businesses to drive the needed 
transformation of our economy. Looking ahead, we expect the focus on sustainability and in particular climate change to further 
accelerate.  
Since the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, we have experience an increasing momentum in sustainable finance 
by clients, investors, and regulators. During this agreement, the financial sector was identified as a critical lever to reach global 
climate targets within the required time horizon and financial regulators around the world became active in driving new market 
standards promoting sustainable finance. Today, we believe that sustainability is the most relevant business opportunity in 2020 
and beyond. Therefore, we work towards putting sustainability in the sense of environmental, social and governance topics (ESG) 
at the core of everything we do. 
At DWS, we have been providing sustainable and responsible investment strategies for more than 20 years. In 2007, we already 
began to integrate ESG factors in the investment process. Embedding ESG factors – and respective risks and opportunities – into 
our investment processes constitutes part of our fiduciary duty. We continue not to launch new products based on momentum 
strategies in soft commodities. Furthermore, DWS was amongst the early signatories of the UN-backed Principles for 
Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2008.  
We are particularly proud of our market-leading ESG Engine, which collects data from 13,000 issuers and helps us to cohesively 
integrate ESG factors in our investment processes. Using this information, we can create customized products around ESG 
themes and we can enable our portfolio managers to assess sustainability risks and make more informed decisions.  
In this context, we invested in cutting edge technologies that are using big data and artificial intelligence to drive more ESG 
insights for our investments. In 2019, we acquired a stake in the high tech ESG data provider Arabesque, which uses quant 
models and machine learning to provide ESG information on over 7,000 listed companies. In our real estate business, we are 
deploying smart building technology that captures real time data and uses artificial intelligence to allow us to operate our buildings 
more efficiently and more sustainably.  
We are aware of our responsibility as a financial market participant and institutional investor to measure and to proactively 
manage the impacts our business activities might have on local communities, society and the environment. Therefore, we 
consider sustainability as one of our key values underpinned by selected sustainability key performance indicators (Sustainability 
KPIs) we will be tracking from 2020 onwards. We believe that these indicators are crucial to our Sustainability Strategy to 
measure and manage progress. Sustainability KPIs will be monitored quarterly by our new Group-wide Sustainability Council. 
Moreover, we agreed to set-up a Group Sustainability Office that will directly report into our Executive Board.

Our new Group Sustainability Office will further drive our sustainability roadmap looking forward which is aligned to what is 
important to our stakeholders including clients, employees and wider society as well as governmental and non-governmental 
organisations. To balance between differing interests, we will continuously engage in a constructive dialogue with our 
stakeholders (please refer to chapter “Stakeholder engagement”). We anticipate that there has never been a more pressing need 
for a collaborative approach to global challenges and that the sustainability risks and opportunities ahead of us are highly 
connected. 
To further measure, manage and make the impact of our business activities more transparent, we will work towards mapping core 
business activities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In 2019 we analysed our impacts on the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the first time and concluded, that we may have the highest impact on goal 8, “Decent 
Work and Economic Growth;” goal 10, “Reduced Inequalities” and goal 13, “Climate Action” (please refer to chapter “Materiality 
Assessment for 2019”).  
The SDGs are a set of 17 global goals focusing on economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We 
see the SDGs as a key reference for aligning with the long-term goals of society and believe it’s our obligation to help achieve 
these goals by measuring our activities against them. We are convinced that the UN SDGs will be an important driver for our 
business in 2020 and beyond.  
Within our Group-wide Sustainability Strategy, “Climate Action” has been a leading theme. As mentioned above, we believe that 
the climate crisis is a paradigm shift for our clients, the companies we invest in and the financial market. We are conscious about 
our responsibility to achieve a positive impact on climate change arising from our role as an active shareholder and global 
financial market participant. In 2020, we plan to develop a dedicated climate strategy including the identification of climate-related 
risks and opportunities across various time horizons, their impact on business units, investment strategies and financial planning.  
By aligning to the UN SDGs as well as formulating our own climate strategy, we will further embed unified sustainability targets 
deeply into our company in 2020 and beyond. Evaluating what impacts our clients, our investments and wider society is our 
priority and prerequisite for the success of our business.  
3.2.1  Company-wide Sustainability Strategy 
[GRI 102-2; 102-15] 
Embedding sustainability criteria in DWS’ corporate DNA and putting it at its core, is not only aimed at helping us to future-proof 
our franchise but also to participate in the global growth of sustainable and responsible investing. As part of our company-wide 
Sustainability Strategy, we have initiated a review of our entire operating model and as a result formulated a comprehensive 
DWS-wide Sustainability Strategy complemented by a clear execution plan.  
In order to embed sustainability criteria in both our fiduciary as well as our corporate activities, we set-up numerous internal 
workstreams across our entire operating model and agreed with DWS’ Executive Board on concrete strategic ambitions with 
regards to sustainability for the respective areas. From the start, DWS’ Executive Board was closely involved in the decision 
making process and is regularly monitoring execution progress.

DWS   3  –  Presentation of DWS Group   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
In 2019, these strategic ambitions were translated into four priorities: 
1.  Making sustainability the highest management priority: We have agreed a new organisational set-up to manage 
sustainability across DWS to be implemented in 2020: (a) set-up a of a new Group Sustainability Office that drives and 
orchestrates a common Sustainability Strategy for DWS, (b) set-up of a new Group Sustainability Council for discussing 
and aligning on Group-wide sustainability topics, and (c) a Council for Responsible Investments to guide the investment 
platform on material risks from ESG factors 
2.  Smart integration of ESG factors in the investment process: We seek to strengthen the consideration of ESG risks and 
opportunities in the investment process and enhance our engagement activities by introducing rules and processes on 
material ESG risks, for example climate transition risk which leads to a forward-looking identification of sustainability 
risks (see chapter Sustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible Investing) 
3.  Develop market leading products: We plan to further build-out our global ESG product suite by encompassing ESG-
versions of our most relevant funds as well as by developing new generation ESG products  
4.  Integrate sustainability criteria in corporate processes: We aim to embrace sustainability criteria in our corporate DNA 
and manageable behaviour 
The following successes have already been achieved in 2019: 
−  In April, DWS partnered with Postbank for its first major sustainability funds sales campaign around its DWS Invest SDG 
Global Equities fund. DWS Invest SDG Global Equities invests in firms that confess to at least one United Nation’s Sustainable 
Development Goal and make the goal a key part of their business model  
−  In July, DWS announced the acquisition of a 2.68% minority stake in Frankfurt-based ESG-scoring provider Arabesque S-Ray 
GmbH. Arabesque S-Ray offers a variety of services and products in the field of ESG. The scores will be added to our DWS 
ESG Engine and will therefore be considered in our portfolio management process 
−  In August, we introduced Climate Transition Risk Scorings to identify risks and opportunities associated with a transition to a 
low carbon economy. These scores determine an implicit relevance and derive a consensus climate risk rating on issuer level 
by assessing and ‘preserving’ different vendors’ original verdict. Access to the scores is provided globally to DWS portfolio 
managers and analysts in Equities, Fixed Income and Multi-Asset. In September, DWS joined the Coalition for Climate 
Resilient Investment (CCRI). The goal of the CCRI is to transform infrastructure investments by integrating climate risks into 
the decision-making process, driving a paradigm shift toward a more climate resilient global economy. The CCRI initiative, the 
first- private sector-led coalition comprises companies from across the investment value chain with a total of USD 5 trillion of 
assets. It includes governments and multilateral organizations  
−  In October, DWS committed to a 50% carbon reduction by 2030 goal in its European office real estate portfolio. This 
emphasizes DWS’s decade-long focus on the topic of climate change 
−  In November, DWS’ head of Responsible Investments was elected to the board of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate 
Change (IIGCC). The IIGCC is a leading global investor membership body and the largest one focusing specifically on climate 
change. IIGCC has over 190 members, among them many of the largest asset owners globally. Being part of IIGCC’s board is 
an opportunity to further leverage the collective knowledge of the group  
3.2.2  Stakeholder Management 
[GRI 102-12; 102-13; 102-21; 102-40; 102-42; 102-43; 102-44; 102-46] 
Our value chain consists of different stakeholders, including clients, investors, employees, shareholders and suppliers, as well as 
regulators, communities, media, civil society as well as public and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  
While the interests of our stakeholders may be conflicting, we have to negotiate between these interests. We are open to 
constructive critique and dialogue, which we believe is crucial to improve our sustainability approach.  
We consider a constructive engagement to be integral to understanding the expectations and concerns of our stakeholders. It not 
only helps us to comprehend the positive as well as negative impacts of our business activities more broadly, but also promotes 
acceptance for what we do, as we strive to strengthen trust and partnerships, and improve our sustainability performance. We are 
convinced that engaging with our stakeholders is crucial to create a common understanding and a collaborative approach to 
shared global challenges.  
All of our identified stakeholders have responsible points of contact within DWS Group. In 2020, we plan to orchestrate relevant 
stakeholder relationships in the newly set-up Group Sustainability Office. This Group Sustainability Office will be responsible for 
leading the ESG Strategy and for managing internal and external relationships with respect to sustainability (e.g. with rating

agencies, NGOs, academics) with the aim to coordinate all relationships centrally and to leverage experiences and capabilities 
within the organisation. In 2019, the following DWS hosted events, industry participation, shareholder engagement and internal 
initiatives took place: 
DWS hosted events   
Several events were hosted by DWS to engage with clients, industry members and investors: 
−  More than 100 institutional clients attended DWS’s two-day Investment Conference in February 2019 in Frankfurt. The CIO 
view was presented and opportunities and risks for institutional clients analysed. Further, the conference focused on the 
challenges facing Europe and was comprised of several speakers and eight workshop themes. 
−  DWS hosted more than 50 attendees at a PRI conference in New York in March 2019. One of the main topics discussed was 
the transition to a regenerative economy and the implications on investment portfolios. 
−  We were a Gold sponsor at the PRI in Person 2019 conference in Paris and hosted a dinner for 100 clients, partners and 
industry members. 
−  DWS Singapore held an ESG client engagement event in Singapore in November 2019 to showcase its thought-leadership on 
sustainable investments. Over 40 attendees were present at the event, which was also supported by a speaker from the UN 
PRI. 
−  In October 2019, DWS was premier sponsor of the GIIN Investor Forum 2019 in Amsterdam and hosted a dinner for 50 impact 
investors. This conference brings together over 1200 impact investing professionals from six continents. 
−  We hosted ESG Talks events in Madrid, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Belgium and Luxembourg throughout the 
year with a focus on selected topics with respect to ESG, e.g. DWS ESG Engine, ESG integration into Active and Passive 
Portfolios, key trends on Sustainable investing or the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan.. The target audience for these 
events are institutional and wholesale investors selected by the local sales people in the respective countries. 
−  DWS hosted an event with institutional investors including a senior representative of the Bank of England’s Climate Hub. 
The events added to improve our common understanding on relevant trends and further supported creating a cohesive network in 
the area of sustainability. Moreover it underlines our ambition and engagement in sustainable and responsible investing.  
Industry participation  
−  The Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Office for Responsible Investments has continued its work in the international climate 
arena and events from an investment perspective by participating in numerous roundtables and events over the cause of 
2019.  
−  DWS was the only asset manager to provide input to the UNEP FI background paper1 for the Global Commission on 
Adaptation: “Driving Finance Today for the Climate Resilient Society of Tomorrow”.  
−  DWS provided input to the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority’s Climate Financial Risk Forum2 through the 
Scenario Analysis Working Group. The report from this working group will be published in 2020.  
−  In Q4 2019 DWS was invited to co-chair the real estate work-stream of the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative, organised by 
the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC). Other DWS experts are participating in work-streams focused on 
public equities and corporate bonds, sovereign bonds and Strategic Asset Allocation. 
−  In December 2019, DWS co-authored the IIGCC’s “Investor expectations guide for listed real estate”3 in our role as co-chair of 
the property working group. DWS presented the report to a meeting of the sustainability committee of the European Public 
Real Estate Association (EPRA).   
Our engagement with relevant industry associations and forums added to actively shape the agenda on relevant sustainability 
topics.  
Stakeholder engagement   
We have been in dialogue with our stakeholders on the subject of sustainability as we seek to adopt such criteria in our business, 
both in terms of growth opportunities, related risks as well as our corporate culture. As a listed asset manager we have been 
engaging in such topics, and prior to our IPO, we contributed via our parent, DB Group.  
In 2019, most of our conversations with investors have been centred on what we are doing to differentiate ourselves in the ESG 
product category. We have regularly mentioned our ESG product launches during 2019 (for more details regarding new products,

Ratings 
After our IPO, 2019 was the first year in which DWS pursued its own sustainability ratings. As a consequence DWS proactively 
engaged with relevant rating providers:  
−  DWS has achieved the highest possible rating, A+, for Strategy & Governance in the annual Principles for Responsible 
Investments (PRI) assessment. DWS has improved its score in 3 out of 9 modules, and fared better or at least in line with 
other PRI signatories in all categories. As an early signatory to the PRI, DWS is required to report on responsible investment 
activities and progress on an annual basis. 
−  DWS participated in a review by WWF on asset managers who are responsible investment leaders on how they address ESG 
issues in their investment activities. Results are available in WWF’s online tool - RESPOND (Resilient and Sustainable 
Portfolios that Protect Nature and Drive Decarbonisation). DWS received especially positive feedback regarding relevant 
product availability as well as on how the topic is engrained in DWS’ purpose.    
−  DWS finished among the Top 10 global asset managers voting on shareholder resolutions linked to climate change according 
to a recently published report of UK campaign group ShareAction. 
−  At the end of 2019 DWS decided to proactively pursue a CDP rating in 2020.

Lobbying 
−  Since 2009, DWS has signed the annual investor letter to governments, calling for stronger climate policies. As of December 
2019, the letter6 was signed by 631 investors with over USD37 trillion in assets.  
−  In April 2019, DWS’s CEO signed a letter to European heads of state7, along with CEOs from more than 50 businesses, 
investors and business networks, calling for the EU to endorse a long-term decarbonisation strategy to achieve climate 
neutrality by 2050. DWS also signed a similar letter sent from IIGCC to EU heads of state in December 2019. DWS contributed 
to an IIGCC report on an EU strategy for long-term decarbonisation.  
−  As part of industry associations such as those listed in the previous section, DWS experts provided input to a number of policy 
consultations from different governments. DWS did not prepare its own consultation response to any sustainability related 
government consultation.  As a member of EEFIG, DWS as invited to present our views on European energy efficiency 
policies at a plenary meeting of the European Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group.  
Our engagement supported to proactively shape regulation helping to shape the markets in which we invest.    
Internal dialogue 
The workers council is the elected representative of non-executive employees of DWS Group companies in Germany and acts as 
a mediator between the firm and employees, while executive employees are represented by the ‘DWS Sprecherausschuss’, as 
governed by German law. We have a close and constructive relationship with employee representatives based on mutual trust. It 
is common practice to involve these bodies early and to the fullest extent possible to provide employee engagement. To ensure 
regular communication between DWS Group and the workers councils, and in order to follow the participation rights, meetings 
take place frequently. 
We conduct people surveys on an annual basis, with a full survey that is addressed to all employees as well as ad-hoc surveys 
focusing on a partial representative population taking place on a bi-annual basis.

DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
4  Clients and Products 
4.1  Sustainable Finance, ESG Products and Responsible Investing 
4.1.1  Fiduciary Responsibility 
The asset management industry plays an increasingly important role in society, including making the financial system more 
sustainable. This means integrating ESG and long-term-sustainability topics such as climate risk into investment strategy, risk 
management, asset allocation, governance and stewardship activities. Financial regulators around the world are to a greater 
extent focusing on financial institutions' capabilities, preparation and actions to manage climate change and other material 
sustainability risks. 
On 5 June 2019, the first annual general meeting (AGM) of DWS Group GmbH & Co KGaA took place and our Chief Executive 
Officer has announced “to make sustainability a core component of its fiduciary action”5. This has further amplified our role as 
fiduciaries for our clients and our obligation to help them keep and build their wealth. This continues to apply even more to include 
non-financial, environmental, social and corporate governance factors to the best possible extent. We do this to further strengthen 
ESG integration efforts in every part of our investment process. Putting ESG at the core of our fiduciary actions goes beyond our 
own investment decisions but also by intensifying active ownership of our holdings, extending proxy voting and number of 
engagement activities to drive change for the benefit of our clients. 
In order to assume our fiduciary duty, DWS continues to rely on the CIO Office for Responsible Investments, which was 
established in 2017. The team’s tasks and mandates consist of developing structures, processes and data for integrating ESG 
considerations in Active, Passive and Alternatives. The area creates awareness and knowledge among analysts and portfolio 
managers and is responsible for creating engagement and assuming our stewardship role. We aim to continuously enhance the 
level of ESG integration across our entire Active and Alternatives investment platforms and to increase the number of dedicated 
ESG mutual fund strategies with our DWS ESG investment standard. For our Passive business, DWS believes that stewardship 
is a key differentiator which we underlined with a survey conducted in collaboration with CREATE-Research6.

In order to manage DWS’s exposure to F-rated7 securities as a % of our liquid AuM which is actively managed, DWS has made 
the decision to implement a process called “smart integration” underpinned by a Council for Responsible Investments. In 2019, 
we have analysed DWS’s exposure to F-rated securities and formalized an approach to be implemented in 2020. 
4.1.2  Policies 
Furthermore, we are subject to several internal policies, such as our publicly available "Responsible Investment Statement (RI)”8 , 
our "Policy on Controversial Conventional Weapons"9 or our "ESG Integration Policy for Active Investment Management"10 as

tionGuid=075836e4f99347b2a2de1939c5912cbf 
6   We note that due to the nature of the business the opportunities to integrate ESG in passive are restricted to stewardship (proxy voting and active ownership). For additional information on 
our survey, please refer to the following link: https://etf.dws.com/globalassets/campaigns/create-study/passive-investing-2019_the-rise-of-stewardship_read-version-.pdf 
7   We define F-rated as the poorest rating in either Climate Transition Risk (measured by CTRR) or norm compliance as measured by our new norm 2.0 rating. For our 2020 ambition, a de-
creasing arrow implies an improvement in the ESG quality of DWS’s actively managed mutual fund portfolio

well as our “Engagement Policy”11. Externally, we comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act by signing the Modern Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Statement12 through DB Group. We publish our most relevant commitments and policies on our dws.com 
website. Our Chief Control Office (CCO) reviews our policies and procedures on a regular basis in accordance with our review 
cycle. In 2019, we also assumed our co-signatory status of the “open letter to index providers on controversial weapons” with 
respect to their mainstream indices and by playing an active role in raising this issue in our conversations with index providers. 
We took an additional step by excluding manufacturers of controversial conventional weapons from our Xtrackers platform. We 
expect this change to become effective in Q1 2020. 
4.1.3  Commitments 
International standards such as the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations, Cluster Munitions 
Convention and Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) are guiding principles for our business.  
DWS has long recognized the importance of ESG factors for investors and was among the early signatories of the United 
Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2008. We believe that our expertise and lengthy experience in 
sustainable investing provide valuable insights that assist us to further protect and grow our clients’ assets over the long term. 
The CIO Office for Responsible Investments works along the six principles of the PRI and aims at contributing to each of them. In 
addition to what is mentioned under the section “Our Stakeholders”, DWS places particular importance collaborating with the PRI, 
examples include among others: 
−  Presentation at PRI-hosted events in Colombia and Chile

4.1.4  Responsible Investing Governance 
The CIO for Responsible Investments is part of the CIO Office and serves the investment platform for liquid and illiquid assets. 
The CIO Office for Responsible Investments is organized across responsibilities: the Responsible Investment Center14, our 
ESG Engine and Solutions team, the Head of ESG integration for Active, our dedicated Corporate Governance Center and 
the ESG Thematic Research team. The entire CIO Office for Responsible Investments supports our ESG integration activities 
(across Active and Alternative investments), our ESG investment solutions, and product offering. Our Corporate Governance 
Center enables active ownership (the exercise of proxy voting and governance engagement) for our Passive holdings. 
Complementing these activities, we also have investment professionals as ESG specialists embedded across DWS Group 
supporting our ESG activities. This includes an ESG Gatekeeper in every major investment team of the Active platform, senior 
ESG portfolio managers as well as our dedicated Sustainable Investments team within the Alternatives product line. Within 
Alternatives, we also manage real estate investments in certified green-labelled buildings. 
ESG Thematic Research 
In 2019, DWS has integrated the ESG Thematic Research team into the Research Institute, reporting to the Head of the 
Research House who maintains a direct reporting line to a DWS Executive Board Member. The Research Institute is responsible 
for producing research on themes that will affect investments in the next decade and the long view. It will also progressively 
become the primary conduit for delivering all research produced in the investment teams outside the CIO Office. The ESG 
Thematic Research team retains close links with the CIO Office for Responsible Investments. 
In 2019, our DWS ESG Thematic Research team extended their work in publishing special focus articles relating to ESG and 
impact investing. We publish these on our website in order to enable investors, clients and prospective clients access to our in-
sights.15  
The ESG Thematic Research team also participated in a number of industry initiatives, which included:

−  The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), a leading association of 180+ asset owners and Asset 
managers. In November 2019, DWS’s Head of Responsible Investments and Head of Global Client Group for Ireland, UK and 
Nordics, was elected to the board of IIGCC by the association’s members 
−  A member of the ESG Thematic Research team has been co-chair of the IIGCC property working group for 2019. In this role, 
DWS co-wrote a guide to climate related investor expectations of listed real estate companies.  
−  IIGCC established the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative to develop options and investment industry consensus regarding how 
different asset classes could be defined as aligning with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Other DWS experts joined 
working groups on strategic asset allocation, sovereign bonds, municipal bonds, and equities and corporate fixed income 
−  DWS was the only asset manager asked to give input to United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) 
report for the Global Commission on Adaptation on how the financial sector can help society become more resilient to the 
physical impacts of climate change  
−  DWS continued to be one of the few major financial institutions on the steering committee of the EU Energy Efficiency 
Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), an initiative of the European Commission and UNEP FI. DWS has been a founding 
member of EEFIG since late 2013 
−  The team (together with the Head of ESG Integration for Active) organized internal workshops on climate change for our fixed 
income and equity analysts in the mining, energy, utility, food & beverages as well as the automotive sector. During these 
sessions we discussed how relevant information should be taken into account when analysing companies. In March 2019 the 
same presentation was shared in a webinar and inaugural in-person lecture in the context of DWS Research House University. 
 
The team will continue its goal of producing best in class research and thought leadership to help clients and our investment 
professionals understand and integrate sustainability and responsible investing practices as well as to shape key industry and 
government initiates in this area. 
Responsible Investment Center 
The Responsible Investment Center has further developed internal ESG governance structures reflecting local and division-
specific regulatory requirements, and govern the reputational risk and the New Product Approval (NPA) processes. In 2019, this 
role has contributed to knowledge sharing in the organisation such as People Engagement Groups16 (PEG) or in infrastructure 
functions such as Finance, Risk, Legal or Internal Audit. The function also prepares mandatory reporting for DWS’s sustainability 
report, Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and informs internal and external stakeholders of our ESG activities. The 
team engages with NGOs through our Communications department and other external parties, as well as coordinates internal 
ESG-related policies and global memberships and projects within DWS Group. In August 2019, DWS held a meeting with the 
German Federal Ministry of Finance and German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety 
in order to discuss Germany’s role in the European discussion on sustainable finance. In autumn 2019, DWS was among a few 
German asset managers to provide feedback on the consultation version of BaFin regarding their Guidance Notice on Dealing 
with Sustainability Risks17 . Together with the CIO for Responsible Investments, the Responsible Investment Center also owns 
the taxonomy for labelling DWS products and strategies as ESG and classifying the underlying approach. Both members of the 
CIO Office for Responsible Investments also represented the overall ESG investment topic during DWS’s first AGM in June 2019. 
Together with the CIO for Responsible Investments, the Responsible Investment Center drove major changes for the investment 
platform through the upcoming introduction of “Smart Integration” underpinned by a Council for Responsible Investments. We call 
this process “smart integration” because we decided to focus on risks and opportunities from ESG rather than applying top-down 
sectoral exclusions. Further, DWS believes more in engagement rather than exclusions. The Responsible Investment Center will 
play a further role in shaping DWS’s approach to defining, measuring and monitoring of sustainability risks. This role will be 
performed in collaboration with portfolio management & research, the ESG Engine, the Corporate Governance Center but also 
second line functions such as the Chief Risk Officer for EMEA and involves shaping a sustainability risk appetite at DWS. 
ESG Engine and Solutions 
Our ESG Engine and Solutions team drove major initiatives for improving our proprietary ESG database. The team is responsible 
for ESG methodology, algorithms, and data. The ESG Engine consolidates and produces data, enabling ESG analysis that is 
data-driven. Seven leading ESG data vendors (ISS Ethix, MSCI, ISS-oekom, RepRisk, Sustainalytics, Morningstar ESG and S&P 
TruCost) provide data to the database and enable ESG analysis as part of the investment process. The structured ESG 
information is embedded within our portfolio management tool Aladdin and is available for all liquid asset classes. Both availability 
and coverage of ESG data enables ESG integration for our portfolios. For certain types of asset classes we acknowledge 
challenges18  with the data coverage but are working to increase the coverage. In August 2019, DWS has announced entering

into a strategic partnership with Arabesque S-Ray. We plan to use S-Ray as an additional data vendor for our ESG Engine going 
forward. 
In 2019, we have developed our ESG KPIs (EKPIs) which we piloted for our clients of one retail fund on the DWS’s website for 
retail funds. We continued to develop the ESG methodology, especially with regard to carbon and climate risk sensitivity and a 
recalibration of our Norm Rating. Both developments will be explained in additional detail in the section “Contribution to Action on 
Climate Change” and “Human Rights and Norm Assessment in the Investment Process”, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the 
development efforts focused on measuring impact through for example green bond investments. We will continue our efforts on 
measuring carbon impact. 
While the ESG Engine continues to be the building block for our Active analysts and portfolio managers (Investment 
professionals) to integrate financially material ESG information in their investment decisions, it is also the foundation of dedicated 
ESG strategies using our ESG investment standards (see section ”ESG Performance of our Products”), for passively managed 
strategies and for Liquid Real Assets (LRA). 
Corporate Governance Center 
Our Corporate Governance Center contributes to in various working groups, among the policy setting teams, networks, and 
commissions mentioned in the section “Our Stakeholders”. We aim to be a thought leader in corporate governance and seek to 
actively shape domestic and global corporate governance developments, striving to represent the best interests of our clients. By 
advocating good governance standards in different working groups and industry networks, we believe we contribute to the further 
development of corporate governance. In Germany, we are participating in the consultation centred on the changes to the 
German Corporate Governance Code and as a member of the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset 
Management (Deutsche Vereinigung für Finanzanalyse und Asset Management e.V., DVFA) continue to promote the DVFA 
Scorecard on Corporate Governance as a measure of governance quality for German companies.  
We have also contributed to the discussions within the German Investment Fund Association (Bundesverband Investment und 
Asset Management, BVI) on the implementation of the Shareholders’ Rights Directive II (SRDII) in Germany. On a European 
level, as a member of the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), we have actively participated in the 
discussions around the development of a new European Union (EU) Regulation on Sustainable Finance. Globally, we have 
continued our active participation in the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and Sustainability In March 2019, our Head of 
Corporate Governance was invited to the Harvard Law School Corporate Governance Roundtable, which aims to contribute to 
policy making discussions and education with respect to current issues in corporate governance. This roundtable is supported by 
representatives from academia, law firms, asset management firms and other industry expert. DWS has been one of two asset 
managers from Continental Europe. DWS was invited to participate in the Roundtable next to permanent institutional investor 
members. In December 2019, DWS signed the membership to become a permanent member of this Roundtable.  
In 2019, we also underlined our commitment to active ownership by strengthening the size of the Corporate Governance Center. 
We also progressed in the harmonisation of the governance of the different DWS Group entities. 
DWS also finished among the leading asset managers globally voting on shareholder resolutions linked to climate change 
according to a recently published report of UK campaign group ShareAction. In a separate report19, DWS was among the leaders 
with over 95% support for climate critical shareholder proposals in 2019. These results confirm DWS's strong record on corporate 
engagement related to ESG matters. 
4.1.5  Integrating ESG Risks and Opportunities in our investment process 
DWS is convinced that putting ESG at the core of our fiduciary actions implies embedding ESG in the investment process more 
firmly. It is important to us that in addition to aligning our clients’ investments with their personal values, striving to improve risk-
adjusted returns or diversifying their portfolios, we can also help them to achieve a positive environmental or social contribution. 
Our RI Statement guides our approach to ESG topics. Financially material ESG topics and global trends are integrated into our 
investment processes in all asset classes across our Active, Passive, and Alternatives investment decisions and we support the 
growth of dedicated ESG products and solutions. In our view, integrating environmental, social, and corporate governance factors 
into the investment process contributes to a better understanding of businesses and the environments issuers operate in. It 
enables us to identify the risks and opportunities that a traditional financial analysis would miss, or fail to systematically address, 
with potentially significant impact on long-term investment performance. Therefore, we aim at increasing the integration of ESG at 
all relevant steps of the active investment process depicted below.

DWS   4 –  Clients and Products 
Sustainability Report 2019 
We understand ESG integration as a complement to traditional fundamental analysis, which adds value to the quality of our 
investment decision and offers opportunities for higher risk-adjusted returns. 
We aim to continuously enhance the level of ESG integration across our entire investment platform. We continuously update our 
ESG Engine, and methodologies for comprehensive analysis of ESG information. The ESG methodology is governed by the 
ESG Methodology Panel (EMP), with representatives from different asset classes and Research. The methodology is 
continuously enhanced and the ESG Engine is reviewed regularly by the functional participants within the EMP. 
At the start of 2019, DWS already had initiatives and measures in place to integrate ESG in every single step of our investment 
process. During 2019, we have further strengthened our ESG integration across the Active investment process with the following 
improvements:  
− Guidelines: We tightened our internal ESG Integration Policy for Active portfolio managers
− CIO View: We expanded our analysis of material ESG global trends into our CIO View, e.g. impacts of technology and climate
change on the different industry sub-sectors
− Training: In order to engage our investment experts with ESG issues, we have organised mandatory internal training since
2011 for most of our investment professionals20 across Active on the assessment of ESG risks and opportunities, our
Responsible Investment framework and the integration of ESG into our investment process. In 2019, our Head of ESG
Integration for Active trained 112 analysts in fixed income credit, high yield and equities via in-person training on the
integration of ESG specific issues in their investment analysis, valuation, internal research notes and investment
recommendation. During the first half of 2019, we uploaded the new videos and materials of the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) ESG certification program into our online Human Resources Education system (called
“Connect2learn”). Since 2017, DWS employees can register for the EFFAS ESG exam for certification, which various
employees completed in March and October of 201921. Overall 36 employees passed the exam and became certified ESG
analysts in 2019. At the end of 2019 DWS counts 123 CESGA® (Certified ESG Analyst) certified employees. We will continue
with in-person ESG training in 2020.
− Research: We enhanced our internal research notes, by integrating material ESG considerations in key aspects of the
company assessment (i.e. business model, competitive position, earnings estimates, risks, governance quality, etc.). This
change was supplemented by ESG training for our equities, credit and high yield investment specialists in Europe and the US.
Our ESG Integration Policy for Active set standards for our investment professional asking them to consider relevant ESG
information in their security assessment in order to more accurately estimate the future risk-return profile of their investment
proposals. The results need to be explained in the research note, considered in the valuation, as well as in the investment
recommendation to the best extent possible. If additional information is needed, an engagement should be initiated, recorded
and monitored.

client facing roles within distribution structure

DWS   4 –  Clients and Products 
Sustainability Report 2019 
− Portfolio management: Our investment professionals are expected to be aware of any exposure to critical ESG issues and
act accordingly. They can screen their portfolio for ESG issues (such as involvement in controversial behaviours, general ESG
quality of their holdings as well as carbon ratings or exposure to controversial sectors), and receive an ESG fund score. Their
exposure to ESG laggards (“E” or “F” rated companies) is part of the performance review meetings within Quality
Management. During 2020 this process will be enhanced with the functioning of our “smart integration” (see below) strategy
and Council for Responsible Investments.
− Client reporting: We developed a more intuitive ESG reporting for our mutual funds (EKPIs) and we started to publish this
report in our website for DWS ESG Retail funds. We have also extended ESG reporting to include a performance attribution
based on the violation of international norms and our Climate Transition Risk Rating.
− Engagement: DWS updated the policy in 2019 and expanded the policy beyond ESG issues. The new policy extends the field
for engagement beyond ESG performance to matters such as strategy, financial performance, risk, capital structure, social and
environmental impact as well as disclosure, culture and remuneration.
Ambition level for a Council for Responsible Investments 
Current regulation already asks investment managers to integrate material non-financial information into their investment 
decisions – alongside financial analysis - as part of their role as fiduciaries. DWS aims to identify and manage risks stemming 
from environmental, social or corporate governance (ESG) factors more effectively and explicitly. On 4 December 2019, the 
Executive Board approved a proposal for an advanced investment process of “Smart Integration of ESG”. This was also 
communicated at the DWS Investor Day on 10 December 2019. DWS has deliberately decided against an approach of 
implementing top-down sector-based exclusions. In doing so, DWS will introduce an overarching process of enhanced level due 
diligence, when there is evidence that issuers face excessive climate transition risk or severe and confirmed violations of 
international norms. The process will be modular in order to take timely controversies into account. The overarching process will 
be rolled out in a two-step approach where in the first step the due diligence is managed by a Council for Responsible 
Investments and is embedded as research into research and portfolio construction process. In a second step, the decisions of the 
new Committee (as opposed to a council) for responsible investments become binding as soon as the sales documentation and 
investment guidelines of the portfolio reflects this new approach. Hence the Council will become a Committee with decision-
making authority. This due diligence process can in the future lead to a potential exclusion from the investment universe. 
Exclusion should only be applied as a last resort since we generally believe more in driving change and assuming stewardship 
responsibilities through engagement rather than using exclusions. Issuers, which receive a waiver for ongoing investment during 
the process should be engaged with on a mandatory basis. F-rated (by climate transition risk or norms violation) companies 
which analysts recommend or PMs want to invest in must be presented to the Committee for approval. The CIO for Responsible 
Investments will chair this Council / Committee22. Initially, it takes place on a weekly basis with the frequency adjusted based on 
the number of cases registered. The committee will include members of the CIO Office for Responsible Investments, Equity and 
Micro Research, Investment Risk Management, Compliance, and the Group Sustainability Officer. This process will be rolled out 
in 2020 and will be refined sequentially depending on data availability and insights. 
Corporate Governance: An important step of our ESG Integration Process 
Our commitment to good governance is an integral part of our investment process and goes beyond our fiduciary duty to exercise 
our voting rights as an important means to ring-fence our investments. We regard active ownership as a powerful force in 
promoting better (in the context of our ESG understanding) policies and practices of our investees and, in turn, driving superior 
long-term performance. We believe that good corporate governance is an important source of higher relative returns on equity 
and fixed income investments in the long-term. 
We continued to maintain a high degree of involvement with our investees around the world using an engagement approach that 
is designed to foster their governance practices and structures and successfully address governance issues. We regard active 
engagement as an essential part of our commitment to supporting good corporate governance. Our approach includes direct 
engagement with the management and the board of directors via a meeting or by writing a pre-season letter, publicly voiced 
criticism at an annual general meeting (AGM) and/or filing of shareholder proposals. We vote according to a stringent set of 
guidelines and a process that does not distinguish between active and passive investments and aims to protect the interests of 
our clients. Our voting process centres on our detailed expectations of good corporate governance and ESG integration, which 
are outlined in our Engagement Policy as well as our Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy.  
22 Due to internal guidelines, only a group of people who are empowered to take binding decisions, may be called a “Committee”. During the preparation phase the group of people will be called 
“Council” and decisions by the group are on a non-binding basis and integrated into among others  Portfolio Construction Team (PCT) process. Portfolio Construction Teams (PCTs) are 
internal teams that refine, challenge and leverage ideas and input factors from our global platform as well as third party research for purposes of providing an additional tool to DWS Portfolio 
Managers (PMs) of certain investment strategies. They are formed by active dialogue and debate along with global macroeconomic and market research as well as by the tactical CIO-View. 
The outcome of a PCT meeting is non-binding for PMs.

Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
We reviewed our Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy23 and continue to challenge whether our understanding of good 
corporate governance still prevails against global market developments. Since 2019, this policy now puts a stronger focus on 
companies’ adherence to responsible investment or environmental, social and governance frameworks such as CDP or PRI. We 
also now put stronger emphasis on responsibility for ESG in the board in line with our own practices at DWS. We underscore this 
commitment by our CEO assuming overall responsibility for the ESG strategy. Furthermore, we analyse the voting results of the 
past proxy voting season and our ongoing discussions with investees during our engagements and take these result into 
consideration when making the necessary adjustments.  
Our core expectations of corporate governance are explained in detail in our publicly available policy and can be summarised in 
the five broad categories as on our website.24 
Engagements and Proxy Voting 
[GRI FS11] 
In 2019, we continued our efforts in active ownership and held dedicated engagements with board and management members of 
our investee companies on environmental, social and governance topics.  
Our investment professionals also continued to regularly engage with the senior management of our investee companies, 
whereby, in addition to the fundamentals, strategy and outlook of the company, ESG topics are discussed. Our engagement 
activities are a key part of our ESG Integration Policy for Active Investment Management, Engagement Policy as well as our 
Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy. They are based on the objective to improve the behaviour of an investee 
company as they relate to environmental, social and/ or corporate governance factors as well as topics like strategy, financial 
performance, risk, capital structure, social and environmental impact as well as disclosure, culture and remuneration. Before 
initiating an engagement, it is important to assess the relevance for our investment exposure and the materiality of the issue. The 
objective of our Engagement Policy is to establish a strategic framework for our investment professionals to fulfil their fiduciary 
and stewardship duty acting in our clients’ best interests. This works by engaging in a two-way dialogue with investee companies 
on strategy, financial performance, risk, capital structure and financially relevant corporate governance topics as well as 
environmental, social and impact topics. In our ESG integration approach, engagement is undertaken by our investment 
professionals in partnership with our Corporate Governance Center for governance issues and ESG gatekeepers for 
environmental and social issues. Where there is a thematic engagement directed to a group of companies at the same time, the 
engagement activity would be undertaken by the corporate governance team and the Head of ESG Integration and the Active 
investment platform would be informed accordingly. Our dedicated governance engagements are based on a thorough analysis 
of the independence and composition of boards, executive compensation practices, transparency on auditors (for example 
selection and engagement), overall company structure and transparency as well as reporting practices. In cases where we 
identify gaps between our expectations regarding governance and the company's attitude towards it, we may decide to start a 
direct engagement with the company representatives. If our initial engagement yields unsatisfactory results, we may take 
additional measures (e.g. letters to the Board, annual general meetings’ (AGM) attendance with a speech). In addition, we will 
send an engagement letter, which elaborates on our core governance values. Next is the call for direct meetings with executives 
or the board chairperson. As a last measure, we will vote accordingly, thereby voting against management proposals, in line with 
our proxy voting guidelines. 
As in past years, we have reviewed our Corporate Governance & Proxy Voting Policy during 2019 to ensure that our corporate 
governance standards reflect the changes in our expectations based on relevant trends as well as regulatory developments and 
remain robust against market standards.  
The relevant adjustments include:  
−  Reduction of thresholds for cumulative equity issuances without subscription rights from 30% to 20% of company’s nominal 
capital and respectively for combined equity issuance with subscription rights from 50% to 40%. Going forward, we will also 
request more information if equity issuances and share buy-back-programs are proposed on the same agenda in order to 
foster the transparency on corporate actions. 
−  If the independent directors do not constitute the majority in the key committees (remuneration, audit and/or risk, nomination, 
presiding), we will hold the Nominating Committee Chair accountable for the poor composition.  
−  Enhanced disclosure on individual attendance: As transparency plays a major role in assessing the governance quality and the 
board effectiveness and efficiency, we expect companies to disclose the individual attendance of board and committee 
members as well as an indication on their independence.

−  We will also generally support proposals asking for the right to act on written consent in cases where companies do not 
provide sufficient measures for shareholders to act in such a manner, i.e. the right to call for a special meeting by shareholder 
requires a threshold exceeding 10% (taking into account the ownership structure). 
In 2019, we talked to 162 companies during 207 governance engagements for our funds domiciled in Europe and Japan, which 
represented more than a 22% increase versus the previous year. We attended 19 AGMs in 2019, voicing our criticism at a 
majority of them particularly concerning shortcomings in governance associated with strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
transactions. A majority of our engagement counterparts at our investees included chairpersons of the board of directors, lead 
independent directors, senior executive management representatives and legal affairs managers. For additional information, we 
published our Governance Engagement Report in May 2019 and aim to provide the next volume in H1 2020. Engagements also 
focused on global environmental and social topics, where DWS has engaged with a globally operating steel company domiciled in 
South Korea. One key topic with the issuer’s sustainability department was deforestation and protection of biodiversity. We 
engaged with a tobacco company in Japan, which had an unsatisfactory rating for its international norm compliance, with 
particular issues around failure to prevent child labour. 
In 2019 for assets domiciled in Europe and Japan, we voted at a total of 2,043 meetings in 57 markets of listing, which 
represented an increase of 64% compared to last year. The holdings are voted based on our Proxy Voting Focus List, which 
includes our most relevant holdings screened on assets and relevant ESG ratings. These meetings represented approximately 
78% of our equity assets under management in Europe and Japan. We aim to gradually increase the number of meetings voted 
per year, making sure not to compromise on the quality of the analysis. The results for our proxy voting and engagement is 
annually reported on our website25. For the mutual funds domiciled in the US, we strive to exercise the voting rights for all equity 
holdings. In 2019, we voted at a total number of 9,466 meetings in 66 markets of listing.

4.1.6  Contribution to Action on Climate Change 
[GRI 201-2; FS8]  
Combatting climate change continued to be one of the most important ESG issues. DWS commenced publishing reports on the 
investment implications of climate change already in October 2007. As in the past, climate change has been a key topic for our 
engagements and proxy voting. In 2019, DWS has made significant progress through the development of a climate transition 
risks and opportunities (CTRR) score out of our ESG Engine and Solutions team. This key metric has become part of our 
research and investment process during the 3rd quarter of 2019 and has become part of the ESG investment standards in 
December 2019. 
Corporations face challenges from the world’s action against climate change. With carbon prices increasing by regulations and 
certain carbon intensive activities politically abandoned, carbon intensive products and services can become more expensive. 
The economic risk of having to absorb income reductions under increased carbon prices is called transition risk (in this case, 
climate transition risk). There may be “winners” which offer climate solutions to the markets, most notably concerning alternative 
renewable energies, energy efficiency and green buildings. In 2019, we went beyond publishing reports on investment 
implications of climate change or active ownership on the topic by advancing the way we integrate climate related data into our 
investment process. We improved our data by developing a climate transition risks and opportunities score, which adopts a more 
forward looking perspective than inherently backward looking metrics (e.g. carbon footprint). In September 2019, at the quarterly 
CIO Day of DWS the CIO for RI presented how equity mainstream indices and as such investment universes are broken down 
into climate transition risk leaders and laggards. This has been compared with DWS’s equity sector allocations and possible

options for reallocations. The results on how mainstream indices and as such investment universes are broken down into climate 
transition risk leaders and laggards have been published and shared with our clients on the dws.com website26.  
In December 2019, DWS introduced its CTRR into its ESG investment standards for its dedicated ESG mutual funds which have 
a uniform application of sectoral exclusions, avoiding norm violations and applying best-in-class assessment for overall ESG 
quality. These ESG investment standards now foresee avoiding climate transition laggards based on TruCost (using IEA 
scenarios), MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS-Oekom. In 2019, we have piloted the analysis for corporates; we will roll this out further 
for sovereigns as well and are working on including water risk at an issuer level. We will continue to embed CTRR further into our 
internal committees and processes in 2020. On the development of metrics on CTRR and water risk, we are also working on 
developing improvement- and reduction targets for key areas of DWS’s investment portfolio. 
Investment 
−  Continued our partnership with a significant corporate client and extended a clean energy fund to invest in climate solutions in 
China in the context of the China Clean Energy Fund. 
−  Converted our DWS Invest Climate Tech into an ESG version at the end of 2019 
−  Continued to develop the Africa clean energy strategy with the UN Green Climate Fund. 
−  Promoted retail distribution campaigns for DWS Invest Green Bond fund and DWS Invest SDG Global Equities fund to scale 
up capital market investment.

Within our investments, we closely analyse the commitment made by companies to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
and how these are reflected in executive compensation. Another focus is the pressing need to fight climate change. This has 
resulted in various discussions with portfolio companies, working groups coming together, new regulations being set at EU level 
and shareholders demanding more action from companies on this issue. 
We have continued our active support of the Climate Action 100+ initiative with our engagements with one of the world’s largest 
corporate greenhouse gas emitters to curb emissions, strengthen climate-related financial disclosures and improve governance 
on climate change risks. In the last two years, the company made significant improvements to the governance of ESG aspects. 
They also enhanced their transparency in terms of reporting on non-financial aspects and in this context also follows the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Going forward, we will continue our 
constructive dialogue with the company. 
Further examples on corporate engagement, policy advocacy and stakeholder education 
−  Continued engagement with major investees on corporate governance including on climate change related issues and 
continued support for voting in favour of climate-related AGM resolutions in the US. 
−  As co-chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change’s (IIGCC) property working group, DWS continues to help 
developing climate-related expectations of listed real estate companies. 
−  DWS assumed its investor commitment to support a Just Transition on Climate Change through IIGCC and the EU Energy 
Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG), DWS continued to advise policy makers on how to improve energy efficiency 
policies.

Conference (Conferencia Iberoamericana sobre Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible) in Spain. 
4.1.7  Our ESG CIO View and Market Outlook 
We integrated global ESG trends into the DWS CIO View, which is our in-house market view that supports our investment 
decisions. Our CIO View consists of a consistent, transparent and repeatable decision-making process to ensure one global 
house view on macroeconomic topics, our financial market forecasts, our outlooks for individual asset classes or our views on 
market risks. By including ESG information, we aim to reduce our investment risks, explore business areas with growing demand 
and leverage our central role in the investment process in order to make important contributions to society. With the introduction 
of ESG information into our sector allocation process in 2018, we started to integrate analysis of the global ESG trends that are 
material for various sectors. We consider this step as an important addition to our investment value chain and a way to consider 
ESG impacts into our asset allocation and portfolio construction. The integration of ESG topics into our CIO View is continuously 
expanded regarding relevant ESG trends.

DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
In 2019, DWS drove improvements in the following areas. Beginning 2019, DWS made use of its analyst assessments in order to 
write about “climate-related risks” and their underlying key performance indicators. The publication in spring 2019 has dealt with 
the green election wave and in summer we published the first results of our CTRR score with an implication for asset allocation. 
The insights are communicated through our quarterly CIO View publication on our website27. 
In November 2019, DWS further highlighted the importance of ESG themes for the first time in DWS’s market outlook for 2020. 
This outlook contained among others regulatory drivers for certain sectors and informed our clients for example on investment 
opportunities arising out of climate transition risks and opportunities or the circular economy.  
4.1.8  Research and Strategy related portfolio construction 
Within our various investment teams research and portfolio management capabilities are fully integrated. Analysts carry out 
proprietary research in their area of expertise within the global network, contributing to a broad global coverage of stocks, credit 
or other financial instruments. Across the active equity platform analysts regularly share their knowledge and insights at a global 
level. These updates help identify global sector themes and trends and determine the implication of such trends for the 
assessment of single stocks. The Equity Research team decides which stocks should be actively covered on the Equity platform. 
If the covering analyst believes that there is no longer a valid investment case and when the stock is neither a significant sector 
benchmark weight nor represents a significant holding on the DWS active equity platform, the analyst can drop this stock from 
their active coverage. Roles and responsibilities of research analysts are documented in the Equity Research Handbook and the 
Credit Research Handbook.  
We regard ESG integration as an investment approach that integrates ESG information into fundamental financial analysis to 
improve the estimate of the future expected risk / return of a security. All investment professionals within Active are bound by the 
ESG Integration Policy for Active Investment Management as well as the Engagement Policy. In 2019, the overall research 
process has been improved to integrate ESG factors more closely into financial considerations. DWS has tightened the ESG 
Integration Policy for employees on the Active investment platform such that all research analysts in equity and fixed income 
should include ESG aspects into earnings estimates, valuation models and investment recommendations in a more detailed 
manner.  
This process has been implemented in their respective ESG integrated research notes for investment professionals in equity and 
fixed income research. DWS continues to update the research notes accordingly during 2020. During 2019, we have also 
enhanced our Equity Research Handbook to feature a special section on ESG integration. This also includes a description of 
guiding policies, main sources of ESG data, key factors to be considered during the research process and information about the 
engagement and proxy voting process. The goal for the investment professional is to understand any mismatch between 
financially relevant ESG issues and the company’s strategy to manage these opportunities and risks. The investment professional 
captures the insights from his or her company research in the equity company short-financial note and long note. In every section 
(including sustainability of business model, quality of governance, risk assessment and valuation) of the company long note, ESG 
information is to be integrated in the assessment. Our Credit Research Handbook within fixed income highlights ESG analysis as 
part of the initiation report whenever a new issuer is added to the research platform. It also highlights that corporate bonds with 
the worst overall ESG rating require a higher credit spread to compensate any risks arising from this adverse sustainability profile. 
Higher credit spreads of firms with poor ESG rating have also been confirmed empirically across investment grade Euro non-
financials through our analysis. 
All of DWS’s equity holdings are in scope of our Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting Policy and our engagement focus list 
does not discriminate between holdings in dedicated ESG strategies and non-ESG funds. Our Liquid Real Assets team on the 
Alternatives platform uses a factor based approach and customized weighting for flexibility in the ESG integration process.  
The results of this proprietary research are distributed in Aladdin Research, a global communication platform and library within 
DWS. Both processes are governed by the Head of Equity and Head of Credit Research, respectively who are members of the 
DWS Research House.  
4.1.9  Human Rights and Norm Assessment in the Investment Process 
[GRI 412-3; FS11]  
DWS is fully committed to our responsibilities in relation to human rights. The UN Guiding Principles clearly expect companies to 
operate to a higher international standard in situations where national laws are not sufficient to respect human rights. When 
controversies are assessed in the ESG Engine as part of our investment process, international norms are applied, whereby the 
guiding principles are codified in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). Other important norms are manifested by the

DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
International Labour Organisation (ILO) or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations. Our ESG-Engine based norms 
compliance checks for:  
−  human rights abuses or corporate complicity for such abuses  
−  adverse societal or community impact;  
−  violation of labour rights, most notably the right of collective bargaining and free association or  
−  neglected health & safety obligations;  
−  child labour and bonded or forced labour;  
−  adverse environmental impact and  
−  challenged business ethics, most notably incidents of bribery, market manipulation, fraud, corruption, etc. 
In response to DWS’s 2018 Sustainability Report, we felt the need to become more proactive regarding due diligence on human 
rights. This is why we introduced an additional procedure for the identification of actual and potential adverse impacts on human 
rights. Compared to involvements in sectors deemed controversial, screening for norm violations occurs to be much more 
challenging. Our recalibration of norm ratings was motivated by a few shortcomings up until now. As part of the ESG Engine 
algorithm the new norm methodology (so-called “Norm 2.0”) now applies a better severity reconfirmation across vendors by 
aggregating controversies across different vendors. The new methodology also includes controversies, which are not 
exclusively28 related to UN Global Compact violations and other guiding principles such as International Labor Organisation or 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations. It also aggregates multiple “less severe” controversies to treat them equally as 
one severe controversy, also counting the number of controversies. Lastly, the approach puts more emphasis on environmental- 
and human rights topics. As a result of the new approach, a Canadian mining company’s norm rating, for example has been 
readjusted from “E”, i.e. investable to a limited extent for DWS ESG mutual funds, to “F”, i.e. non-investable for dedicated DWS 
ESG mutual funds – mostly since two out of four vendors mapped the controversies on mining activities into different thematic 
groups. Until recently, this aspect would have been undiscovered before re-confirmation of these controversies were applied in 
our proprietary algorithm. 
The goal of introducing DWS’s methodology overhaul related to norm behaviour was to give a more balanced picture on norm 
violations and to reduce the reliance on UNGC only. Out of the total population (ultimate parent) where we have at least one 
vendor coverage, we observe the following changes at the time of the recalibration: 
−  # of E-rated issuers increases from 73 to 80.  
−  # of F-rated issuers increases from 19 to 33 
We will continue to put a high emphasis on issuers’ norm compliance with a particular focus on environmental topics, climate 
change and human rights. 
4.1.10  Implementing ESG Criteria in Fund Treasury and Investment Compliance 
In our view, integrating non-financial information should not only take place in the research and asset allocation process but also 
when cash is not invested into securities. A given portion of a DWS portfolio is allocated in cash, which is by definition non-ESG 
rated (the DWS ESG rating from the DWS ESG Engine applies to corporates and sovereigns). DWS’s Fund Treasury team is 
responsible for depositing non-allocated / non-invested cash positions to counterparty banks for portfolios that subscribed to this 
service. This has the potential to generate interest rates which are higher than at corresponding custodians. Per 31 December 
2019, this process applied to 295 portfolios globally totalling assets under management of € 157 billion (out of € 767.4 billion total 
AuM of DWS). 
In December 2019, DWS Fund Treasury added our ESG investment standard, which we apply for our dedicated ESG funds (see 
section “Creating Dedicated ESG Products”) to the selection process of banks, which are eligible for receiving overnight deposits. 
All of the 17 existing partner banks already fulfil these criteria and will – together with all potential new counterparties – be 
monitored going forward. Using this approach, we make sure that also a non-ESG part of the portfolio is allocated in line with 
ESG criteria. We will continue running this program in 2020. 
Our Investment Compliance teams check for eligibility from an ESG perspective (compliance with ESG investment standards or 
compliance with controversial conventional weapons policy), which is completed by investment guideline monitoring and 
investment guideline compliance. Maintaining conformity in our dedicated ESG mutual funds or ESG investment guidelines for 
our institutional clients is assured by so-called ESG specification sheets, which are executed by Investment Guideline Codings. 
For all actively managed portfolios, our general exclusion policy for issuers associated with manufacturing or proliferation of 
controversial conventional weapons applies.

4.1.11  ESG Integration and Quality Management 
DWS’s dedicated ESG product range has an ex ante approach to ESG integration and ESG specific strategies. That means ESG 
data and information must be considered in the investment process in the form of maintaining exclusions, positive lists, best-in-
class analyses, avoiding controversial sectors, norm violations or laggards in climate transition or ESG quality in general. The so-
called ESG performance of a company (as defined by the investment guideline) is already a pre-requisite for being considered 
part of the investment universe. Once these issuers have qualified for investment, their ESG performance is further assessed 
within the traditional fundamental analysis, impact on the valuation and research recommendation. For dedicated ESG strategies, 
ESG performance is evaluated independently from financial success based on a variety of indicators but are also included in the 
research recommendation (ESG integration). Portfolio managers (PMs) of DWS dedicated ESG strategies are not permitted to 
purchase securities outside of their investment limits / guidelines and our investment guideline teams control this process. For 
DWS’s integrated ESG assets the process is different: ESG criteria are analysed alongside financial criteria and ESG quality 
factors do not overrule financial factors and any financially immaterial ESG factors do not affect investment decisions. Through 
ESG integration, investment universes are not per se restricted ex ante. In doing so, the DWS ESG Engine is available to all 
strategies with liquid underlyings within Aladdin and provides information to the PM for investment decisions. It is important to 
note that ESG integration does not by construction lead to a good ESG portfolio rating as it is the case for ESG dedicated 
strategies. 
We consider a prerequisite to ESG integration to be a broad availability and coverage of ESG data. This allows our investment 
professionals to identify all material factors and to more effectively identify (and manage) risks and opportunities stemming from 
these sustainability attributes. DWS only labels strategies that pursue an ESG integration approach as being 1) actively managed 
and b) having a coverage of ESG data (the overall SynRating) of more than 90% of the portfolio. As of 31 December 2019, we 
are able to classify 1,573 actively managed strategies29 with combined € 413.6 bn in AuM as ESG integrated where the coverage 
of ESG data exceeds 90%. This ESG integration figure excludes our dedicated ESG funds. Our PMs have real-time visibility of 
the ratings of issuers (pre and post transaction) and of their portfolio overall in Aladdin. On a monthly basis, the ESG quality of the 
portfolio can be reviewed in the context of Performance Review meetings and by the investment quality management teams. Our 
regular ESG gatekeeper meetings discuss controversial sectors, issuer changes in terms of ratings. The quarterly CIO day 
addresses global ESG trends on a regular basis.  
4.1.12  ESG transparency towards our Clients 
In 2019, we launched a more specific and standardised ESG reporting for dedicated ESG mutual funds, thereby improving 
transparency to our clients on the ESG quality of those funds. The goal is to make the ESG quality of a fund more apparent. The 
framework provides understandable, well-defined and transparent measures for various ESG attributes. In the past institutional 
clients have received bespoke client reports on the ESG quality of their respective portfolios. In 2019, we have launched a new 
ESG Key Performance Indicators (EKPIs) report to allow a broader audience (e.g. retail clients / public) a more user-friendly 
report. Each ESG attribute is represented in a single rating in the EKPI report, which is easier to understand without the need for 
ESG expertise. In June 2019, DWS piloted the EKPIs to public viewers on the DWS-retail website. We applied the EKPIs to the 
DWS Invest SDG Global Equities fund30. For all other dedicated ESG mutual funds of DWS, the EKPI reports are available upon 
request in English and German. We aim to roll this out to additional ESG retail funds in the future. The introduction of an ESG 
Reporting Panel in December 2019 aims to continuously refine and improve our range of ESG reports available for our clients. 
We have also upgraded the functionality of the ESG Engine outside of Aladdin by developing a so-called ESG-Live functionality. 
This helps our client relationship managers for our institutional clients in demonstrating the outcomes of theoretical reallocations 
of portfolios towards higher ESG-quality issuers. 
For our home market in Germany, our Head of EMEA Coverage, who is an Executive Board member of DWS, has initiated a 
comprehensive project with the goal to facilitate knowledge sharing on major ESG topics. The objective is to advise our retail and 
institutional clients on a broader set of topics, such as client-specific ESG goals, risk management or return targets. On 18 
December 2019, the first insights and agendas were presented to the internal project steering committee. We will continue to 
implement the initiatives in 2020. 
In Germany our client relationship team together with the investment advisory team have been able to convert 18 existing 
institutional client mandates into an ESG version by either adopting a bespoke negative list, a negative list by an ESG rating 
provider (such as Oekom) or by adopting DWS’s SynRatings. This resulted into growth in the category “Institutional funds based 
                                                           
29   In this context, “actively managed strategies” comprises the areas “Active” and “Liquid Real Assets” within “Alternatives”. Additional information on the breakdown can be obtained in the table 
“ESG integration at DWS”

4.2  Creating Dedicated ESG Products 
[GRI FS11]  
We believe that our expertise and extensive experience in sustainable investing provide us with valuable insights that assist us to 
further protect and grow our clients’ assets over the long term. The growing importance of ESG is evidenced by regulatory 
developments, independent academic research, as well as our own experience, which reveals that integrating ESG factors into 
the investment process has the potential to improve performance and reduce risk. DWS is in a better position than last year to 
offer bespoke ESG solutions to clients based on their own ESG criteria. This is due to our integration of material ESG factors over 
the last ten years as well as our continuous ESG training for investment professionals. This is also attributable to improvements 
on ESG data such as climate transition risks in our ESG database and the way we integrate ESG data into existing processes in 
the context of our ESG Strategy project one workstream focussed on analysing DWS ESG product suite with an aim to identify 
opportunities across asset classes, regions and fund vehicles. As a result, DWS has developed an approach to building cutting-
edge ESG strategies consisting. This will be explained in greater detail in Section “Designing Products for our Clients”.  
Our framework for dedicated ESG funds is built on the following pillars: 
−  Exclusion-based screening for issuers or sectors that do not meet specific ESG criteria. Our ESG investment standards 
make use of the so-called sector involvement rating for this pillar. Positive screening is an activity that by applying a more 
sophisticated screening methodology flags environmental, social or governance improvements.  
−  Standards-based screening focuses avoiding controversial business practices such around human rights abuses, child/forced 
labour, occupational health and safety, environmental impact, and business ethics. This standards-/norms-based screening 
(please see section “Human Rights and Norm Assessment in the Investment Process”) can be performed by the DWS ESG 
Engine or on the basis of proprietary research of the investment professional. 
−  Corporate best-in-class ratings that seek to identify leaders and laggards with the peer group in regards to ESG issues. 
These best-in-class ratings are based on our SynRatings (“DWS ESG Rating”) and provide a robust and reliable, 360-degree 
assessment of corporations based on a broad range of ESG indicators - from diversity of management to environmentally 
friendly products, occupational health and safety.  
−  Environmental risks and opportunities, including carbon and climate transition risks and opportunities. Our carbon footprint 
report, which incorporates global reporting standards, allows our clients to monitor their carbon balances and implement 
programs to reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore our Climate Transition Risks and Opportunities (“DWS Transition 
Risk” in the graphic below) assesses the way in which corporates manage the transition to a low carbon economy aiming at 
avoiding e.g. financial risks of asset stranding. Both best-in-class rating and DWS Transition Risk rating aim at avoiding low 
ESG performers. For additional detail please refer to the section “Contribution to Action on Climate Change”. 
−  For fixed income products the ESG Engine provides an assessment of whether a fixed income instrument is a green bond as 
defined by the Green Bond Principles31. We apply an additional layer of screening to evaluate the sustainability benefits of the 
project(s), consideration of refinancing in the project selection process and norm compliance issuers or controversies related 
to the project 
−  For sovereign bond funds or multi asset products, the ESG Engine provides a screening based on sovereign standards to 
gauge responsible investments in around 200 sovereign nations.  
−  For dedicated ESG multi asset funds, DWS has a methodology for assessing the ESG quality of portfolios, such as funds, 
ETFs, or indices based on general ESG quality plus an additional best-in-class approach. In 2019, DWS has made numerous 
recalibrations and advancements to its ESG Engine. 
The application logic of our ESG investment standards (in case of investments in corporate issuers) is shown in the graphic 
below. The letter rating ranges from A (no controversial sector involvement or no association with controversial weapons or no 
indications of violation of international norms; the issuer can be considered an ESG leader) to F (being involved in at least one 
controversial sector or being associated with controversial weapons, or facing confirmed and severe violations of international 
norms or being an ESG laggard). Correspondingly, our mutual fund prospectuses and sales documentation give our retail clients 
sufficient disclosure on how the ESG performance of an issuer is evaluated. Our sector-based screens and analysis of 
environmental and climate risks are geared towards conservation of flora and fauna, protection of natural resources, atmosphere 
and inshore waters, limitation of land degradation and climate change and avoidance of encroachment on ecosystems and loss of 
biodiversity. We continue to analyse on a regular basis whether additional possible criteria during 2020 can be applied or 
evaluate if existing criteria could be tightened.

4.2.1  Dedicated ESG Products and Products with an ESG Integration Approach 
[GRI FS8; FS14] 
By the end of 2019, we reported € 69.7 billion of dedicated ESG and sustainable AuM, € 16.5 billion of real estate investments in 
certified green-labelled buildings and € 862 million infrastructure investments in renewable assets. We managed assets with a 
total volume of € 767.4 billion (as of Dec. 31, 2019). In order to account for the structure of our asset base, we defined AuM as a) 
assets held on behalf of clients for investment purposes and / or b) client assets that are managed by us on a discretionary or 
advisory basis. Within Alternative investments, this can either be fee-earning committed or fee-earning invested capital. 
We generally follow industry standards and guidelines in classifying ESG AuM. Through regional organisations such as the 
European Sustainable Investment Forum (EuroSIF), the US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (USSIF) and UK 
Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF), investor reporting to the Global Sustainable Investment Association 
(GSIA) has become a global standard for categorising ESG assets, and we follow its methodology. In 2019, DWS has decided to 
provide additional transparency in its sustainable assets under management base by introducing additional categories as outlined 
below.

4.2.2  Active 
In 2019, our Active portfolio management teams were responsible for € 40.7 billion of dedicated ESG AuM and for € 515 billion of 
total AuM in Active. Within our active management section we now distinguish between the following categories. This excludes 
actively managed strategies in the Liquid Real Assets space32. 
−  Portfolios managed based on client-driven exclusions: strategies where sustainability is an explicit part of the investment 
guidelines, universe, selection and investment process. Exclusions of sectors or specific norm violations are specified by the 
ESG Engine & Solutions team towards the Investment Guideline Coding team within CCO. By definition, these portfolios are 
for institutional clients only. In 2019, we reported € 24.7 billion. 
−  Portfolios managed according to DWS’s uniformly defined investment standards (please refer to section “Building Dedicated 
ESG Products”) or client-specific derivations: these are mutual funds branded as DWS carrying ESG in the name (except for 
DWS Stiftungsfonds) plus two mandates for Deutsche Bank Pension Fund. In 2019 we reported € 13.1 billion in this category. 
−  Sustainability themed ESG products: sustainability-founded strategies which go beyond DWS’s uniformly defined investment 
standards and provide additional screening for either green bonds or contribution to the SDGs. In 2019 we reported €591 
million mainly attributable to the successful distribution of our SDG and Green Bond strategies. 
−  Third-party initiated or third-party managed funds applying an externally defined ESG approach: mutual fund product initiators 
outside of DWS Group, where either portfolio management or advisory on the product is provided by a 3rd party. In 2019, we 
reported € 2.3 billion in this category. 
−  Actively managed portfolios with ESG integration approach (see section “Defining ESG integration”): ESG integration refers to 
the process by which ESG factors are being integrated into the research and investment decision making process, 
complementary to and alongside financial data. It is a holistic approach that aims at ensuring ESG factors are identified and 
assessed to form an investment decision. Our investment professionals are expected to integrate ESG criteria to the best 
extent. A key component of applying ESG integration is to uncover hidden risks that might remain undiscovered without the 
analysis of ESG information and trends. ESG integration can also be done to identify investment opportunities that are likely to 
outperform competitors as a result of proper ESG management. ESG integration does not prohibit investing in certain 
companies, sectors or countries. The fundamental difference between ESG integration and exclusion is that the application of 
DWS’s uniformly defined investment standards or exclusion reduces the investment universe. Ex ante ESG integration does 
not necessarily reduce the investment universe. In 2019, we reported € 392.7 bn in this category out of € 515 bn in Active. 
In 2019, DWS has decided not to prolong the European Transparency Code33 by EuroSIF for its European domiciled Active retail 
funds that employ our ESG investment standard. We decided to give additional transparency on ESG integration in the context of 
                                                           
32  We define Liquid Real Assets (LRA) as an investment style within our Alternatives business but which – unlike most vehicles within Alternatives – has daily net asset value and daily liquidity. 
Some portfolios within LRA are mutual funds in line with US 1940 Act or UCITS-compliant.  
33  Additional details on the European Transparency Code can be found here: http://www.eurosif.org/transparency-code/

European validity in anticipation to an EU-wide Ecolabel. 
4.2.3  Passive 
Our Passive portfolio management teams were responsible for € 10.9 billion of ESG AuM and for € 155.8 billion total AuM. The 
team implements proxy voting for applicable ETFs, supported by the Corporate Governance Center and makes use of the ESG 
Engine for helping to implement investment decisions. In 2019, we have been building on our success in the area of responsible 
investing with the launch of a new socially responsible ETF, the Xtrackers MSCI USA ESG Leaders Equity ETF (Ticker USSG) - 
the biggest launch at the time of any ETF in the past 15 years. USSG, which began trading 7 March 2019, gained € 740 million in 
assets under management, making it the third-largest ESG ETF. The index was determined in collaboration with a Finnish mutual 
pension insurance company. This ETF launch for the U.S. market was complemented on 26 June 2019 with the Xtrackers S&P 
ESG ETF (SNPE), which seeks investment results that correlate to the performance, before fees and expenses, of the S&P. For 
creating passively managed solutions in our institutional client space, we can rely on existing or customised ESG indices, closely 
cooperating with index providers, or we can use our proprietary ESG Engine to filter a standard market index. 
For our passively managed institutional mandates, DWS was able to build on its success with a Dutch occupational pension 
scheme by launching an indexed tranche for emerging markets equities. Our institutional client relationship teams in Germany 
have also managed to convert various existing passive managed products and mandates for institutional clients into ESG. The 
new investment approaches mostly make use of screens based on exclusions from client-specific negative lists.  
Within Passive Investments we distinguish between the following categories 
−  Exchange traded funds (ETFs) launched by DWS with an ESG optimized approach based on the parent index provided by a 
third party. In 2019, we reported €2.5 bn out of a total of €113.9 bn AuM in European and US-domiciled Xtrackers and ETCs. 
−  Passively managed institutional mandates, where the ESG approach is optimized based on the parent index and is 
customized to the institutional investor. In 2019, we reported € 8.4 bn out of a total of € 41.9 bn AuM in passive mandates for 
institutional clients. 
4.2.4  Alternatives 
In 2019, the Alternatives portfolio management teams were responsible for € 18.1 billion of dedicated ESG AuM (comprising €715 
million in our sustainable investments funds as well as individual real estate and infrastructure assets) out of € 96.2 billion total 
AuM in Alternatives. Within this our investment professionals in LRA pursued an ESG integration approach for € 20.9 billion of 
AuM. 
4.2.5  ESG in Real Estate 
Our real estate investments continue to position ESG as integral to investment strategies. At the core of the approach is our goal 
to preserve and enhance risk-adjusted returns and to reduce environmental risk, improve asset efficiency, and deliver high-quality 
spaces to tenants. In 2019, we have continued our efforts to execute a sustainability plan. We do this through the following 
program for our assets managed from Europe and the Americas: 
−  Gather data: use sensors, smart meters and data automation to gather data and benchmark buildings and portfolio 
performance. 
−  Prioritise and implement: using the data gathered, identify and invest in efficiency measures such as LED lighting, smart 
irrigation, and energy management systems. 
−  Set reduction targets: based on the planned efficiency measures, set property, portfolio and regional energy reduction targets. 
−  Measure impact: measure the actual reduction against the targets and quantify the financial savings and performance. 
This year, we gathered data on 8.4 million square meters of the portfolio in terms of energy and carbon data. In the U.S. we 
implemented projects in 58 properties representing a net investment of € 3.0 million. In addition to our energy efficiency 
programming, we have also commenced programs to address other topics critical to real estate including smart buildings, health 
and wellness and resilience. In 2019, we completed projects and assessments covering these topics in our global portfolio with 
the goal of creating a standardized framework to collect data and implement measures in 2020. 
As of the end of 2019, we managed € 16.5 billion in properties globally with green label designations. These labels include among 
others Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment 
Methodology (BREEAM); ENERGY STAR, a US-government-backed label for energy efficiency.  
36 
 
 
DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
With respect to energy reduction targets and measurement, we set a number of reduction targets across the portfolio including 
the: 
−  2030 carbon reduction goal (Europe offices): In October of 2019, we announced a commitment to achieve a 50% reduction in 
carbon emissions intensity by 2030 across our entire portfolio of Europe offices against a baseline year of 2017.  
−  2030 energy reduction goal (U.S. offices): In 2010, we committed to the US Department of Energy’s Better Buildings 
Challenge, where we set a goal of improving the energy efficiency of four million square feet of properties by 20% before 2020. 
We met this objective four years ahead of schedule at the end of 2016. Since then we have renewed our commitment to the 
challenge to achieve another 20% energy intensity reduction by 2030 across our entire U.S. office portfolio.  
−  2030 water reduction goal (U.S. offices): As part of our renewed commitment to the Better Buildings Challenge we added a 
water reduction goal of 20% by 2020 for our entire U.S. office portfolio 
The above goals are intensity measures and are calculated in terms of emissions or consumption by floor area and as a 
percentage change against a baseline year of 2017. In 2020, we expect to begin measuring and reporting on our Europe carbon 
reduction goal and potentially expand our carbon reduction goal to include other regions and property types. 
In order to provide transparency to our investors, we report into the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), which 
provides an independent assessment of portfolios and funds using a peer-based approach and scoring based on several ESG 
metrics. In addition to our membership in GRESB we have a seat on its Real Estate Benchmarking Committee to help drive the 
continued refinement of the survey. In 2019, we reported on nine of our portfolios (worth € 33.8 billion of AuM out of € 55.6 billion, 
resembling 61% of our direct real estate business), and all achieved Green Star recognition through the GRESB assessment. 
−  Policies and procedures: We have an ESG House View in place, which was approved by the Investment Committee (the 
governing approval body for our real estate investment business) in Europe and the Americas in 2015. Since that time we 
complete annual Sustainability Action Plans, which are approved annually by the Investment Committees in each regions. 
These documents provide the overarching strategy as well as the detailed plans on execution of our ESG strategy for the 
businesses. Additionally, there are ESG components in the key operating procedures documentation for the business. 
−  ESG Assessment process: For all of new properties acquired, we complete an ESG checklist during the due diligence 
process, a requirement we made mandatory in all regions this year. The results are then incorporated into the Investment 
Committee memo and any key recommendations are then incorporated into a section within the narrative of the memo. The 
recommendations highlight both ESG risks and opportunities to consider. Examples include exposure to physical climate risk, 
opportunities for investment in energy efficiency, regulatory risks around Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), and green 
label certifications. If anything among the requirements has a budget impact for DWS or the fund investors that will also be 
included into the recommendations.  
−  Monitoring: As part of our asset and property management we monitor our properties and portfolios around key ESG metrics 
to identify what are the potential ESG initiatives we want to engage in at the property level. For funds managed from the 
Americas and Europe, that information then feeds into the capital plans and roll up into our Sustainability Action Plans as well.  
As a result of our commitments, policies, procedures, and monitoring of ESG quality, DWS’s Direct Real Estate business for 
assets managed from Europe and the Americas integrates ESG information for a business volume covering € 27 billion of AuM 
excluding green labelled buildings. 
4.2.6  ESG in Infrastructure 
[GRI 203-1] 
ESG considerations are incorporated into the investment framework of the Infrastructure business at all stages of the investment 
lifecycle, from the initial screening and due diligence to the asset management and exit stages. During the holding period, we 
monitor the ESG attributes of the investments through quarterly reporting of sector-specific34 key performance indicators (KPIs), 
discussion at management meetings, and integration of those issues into business plans. Our due diligence will also consider 
governance topics such as fraud, bribery, sanctions and compliance, as required. Findings from the due diligence phase are 
incorporated into the Investment Committee paper and presented to the Investment Committee for consideration.  
The Infrastructure business also places emphasis on reporting, producing an annual Sustainable and Responsible Investment 
(SRI) report for investors in two of our infrastructure funds. This report address issues such as Health & Safety and Security; 
Community Service; Labour and Diversity Issues; Transparency, Communication and Governance; and Environmental Issues at 
the fund’s underlying investments. The Infrastructure business also manages a portfolio of €862 million in renewable assets, both 
in debt and equity investments, including solar, wind and waste-to-energy. 
                                                           
34  Those could be health and safety (incl. accident rates) or water efficiency 
37 
 
 
DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
To understand the ongoing ESG performance of its funds against peers, we take part in the infrastructure assessment in GRESB 
for its current funds and investments. We are a member of GRESB and sit on the Infrastructure Benchmarking Committee to help 
drive the development of the survey to establish it as the industry standard for ESG. We also report to the PRI and achieved an A 
rating in 2019.  
During 2019 we have finalised and implemented an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to further strengthen 
and standardise our due diligence process and monitoring of assets. The ESMS documents ESG policies and procedures at all 
levels of DWS Infrastructure, and details how these are incorporated in due diligence and asset management procedures. The 
system also creates obligations on portfolio companies to ensure regular reporting to DWS Infrastructure and compliance with all 
of the applicable regulations regarding ESG issues. 
As a result of this regular reporting and engagement, DWS Infrastructure aims to help drive improvements in ESG metrics and 
performance at its portfolio companies with a view to improving the businesses' sustainability credentials and to create value. 
−  Policies: The Infrastructure business is governed by an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS), which 
provides the overarching framework, processes and governance for our ESG integration approach in Infrastructure. 
−  ESG Assessment process: Similar to real estate, we have an ESG checklist which is implemented during the acquisitions 
process. The findings are then incorporated in the Investment Committee (IC) memo. 
−  Monitoring: As part of the asset management process, we collect data on key ESG metrics within each of the operating 
companies. This information is then used to better refine our asset management strategies and is also reported to our 
investors in the form of a Social and Responsible Investment (SRI) Report. Certain KPIs, such as those around occupational 
health and safety, are also embedded into the performance review process for the operating companies. Additionally, we 
report into GRESB for both our PEIF I and II funds. 
The Infrastructure Debt business is developing an ESG Scorecard tool which we plan to begin using as part of the due diligence 
process, and will assign an ESG rating to each potential investment, which will be incorporated in the IC memos as a quantitative 
assessment of ESG, along with the existing ESG section of the IC memo which is more qualitative. 
As a result of our commitments, policies, procedures, and monitoring of ESG quality, DWS’s Infrastructure business integrates 
ESG information for a business volume covering € 10.4 billion of AuM excluding sustainability themed infrastructure investments 
in our infrastructure funds managed in Europe. 
4.2.7  ESG in Private Equity 
In 2019, the business adopted a standard process to review potential investments from an ESG perspective: 
Screening: ESG metrics relevant to investment opportunities must be evaluated preliminarily to be considered further during the 
due diligence process. The types of risks screened for include governance issues, such as potential fraud or reputational risks; 
social issues with the workforce or the surrounding communities; environmental risks; occupational health & safety issues and 
accident track record.  
Due Diligence: During due diligence on specific investment opportunities, the investment team will review the potential transaction 
counterparty’s ESG Policy and framework and assess the extent to which the investment and the manager in the potential 
transaction adhere to the key concepts defined by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The business also uses the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Materiality Map to identify risks and KPIs most relevant to the industries in 
which it invests, and opportunities are often benchmarked against the ESG leaders in both the company’s asset class and among 
comparable alternatives within the industry. Findings are then documented in the Investment Committee memorandum, which will 
then be submitted to the Investment Committee for consideration as part of the deal evaluation. 
The team is continuing to refine its ESG approach around monitoring and engagement in the ongoing management of assets.  
4.3  Sustainable Investment Funds and their Contribution to SDGs 
[GRI 203-2; FS7; FS14]  
Sustainable Investments (SI) operates investment initiatives within the Alternatives division that combines positive and stable 
financial returns with measurable economic, social and/or environmental outcomes (“triple bottom line”).  
38 
 
 
DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
In 2019, SI acted as investment manager as well as advisor for eight sustainable and impact funds with a combined volume of 
€715 million, an increase from € 595 million in 2018, a 20% increase. During the year, two closed end funds reached their 
maturity dates and began winding down: Essential Capital Consortium B.V. and Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium II. 
Through the end of 2019, the funds had returned a total of more than € 100 million in capital to investors35. On the other side 
assets under management for those funds that are in investment mode36 have been increased by € 125 million. The existing 
mandates of SI range cover energy (clean energy, energy storage, energy usage), environment (food/agriculture, waste, water) 
and financial inclusion.

DB MDF was launched in 1997 with the mission to provide small loans to emerging microfinance institutions in the developing 
world.  After more than 20 years of lending activity, the DB MDF Board decided to undergo a strategic review process to lay out a 
new direction for DB MDF, taking into account the fact that the market for investment in microfinance institutions has grown 
substantially since it first began operations. 
We track and report on each SI investment fund based on the social and/or environmental performance of the investees. The 
indicators are sector-specific and monitored using fund-specific tools. For our renewable energy, energy efficiency, and 
microfinance investment funds we are supported by greenstem™, our proprietary impact management tool to monitor impact. 
At the same time, via quarterly reporting, portfolio managers have visibility of the overall impact of the fund, i.e. environmental 
and/or social contributions. Based on calculations for the European Energy Efficiency Fund (eeef) up until 30 September 2019, 
the fund financed 15 projects within the European Union that report an accumulated savings of 491,800 metric tons of CO2 
equivalent emissions and 1,283,835 MWh of primary energy37 (at Q3 2019)38. Along the investment portfolio SI manages five 
technical assistance projects for communities and public authorities within the EU.   
Another example of the impact shifts is the activity of the Africa Agriculture and Trade Investment Fund, AATIF. AATIF operates 
an Impact Measurement & Evaluation Framework under which each investment undergoes an impact appraisal performed by 
independent researchers. Selected projects are analysed in more extensive impact evaluations. The Fund publishes its results 
regularly via www.aatif.lu. As an example, researchers identified that cocoa farmers in Ghana participating in an out-grower 
scheme, the Cocoa Abrabopa Association, operated by an investee of AATIF could obtain about double their yield compared to 
farmers that do not participate in the scheme, mainly a function of a the use of fertilizer supplied via the out-grower scheme. 
Another finding is that the out-grower scheme reached farmers that were located in villages somewhat less served with 
                                                           
35  The SI team is working on a final assessment on positive impact and contribution to the SDGs 
36  During 2019 those have been AATIF, eeef and GMF III 
37  Energy efficiency and clean urban transport projects

infrastructure and public services. Nevertheless, participating households are on average significantly more wealthy compared 
with the test group.39  
As a tailor made mandate, DWS acts as manager of the China Clean Energy Fund, a fund that connects suppliers of a major 
consumer electronic company with renewable energy projects. Up until 2022, DWS is mandated to invest nearly USD 300m to 
develop projects totalling 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China. The Fund is part of the corporate client’s commitment to use 
100 percent clean energy power in the production of its goods across all 44 suppliers in 16 countries.40 
4.4  Client Satisfaction 
Our fiduciary duty also defines how we conduct business every day: in the best interest of our clients. We therefore strive to 
embed client centricity throughout our organization as a guiding principle, as we firmly believe client satisfaction to be best 
reflected in our daily interactions and in the long-term relationships with our clients. Our aspiration is a high level of quality in our 
interactions with clients and advisors, as well as to continuously improve the quality of our services.  
The organizational structure reflects this commitment towards our clients. Our client coverage structure is organized regionally for 
EMEA, APAC and the Americas, taking full responsibility for client satisfaction. All three client coverage heads report directly into 
our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
Our approach to assessing and ensuring client satisfaction remains based on three pillars, namely complaint management, client 
satisfaction surveys and third party assessments. 
4.4.1  Complaint Management 
The first pillar in assessing our clients’ satisfaction is the management of complaints. This provides us with valuable insights into 
how we are performing in the eye of our clients. A robust and consistent client complaint handling and reporting process helps 
facilitate improvement of client satisfaction by identifying, and remediating poor client outcomes, learning from and, thereby 
assisting with the reduction of mistakes and attributable costs, risk transparency enhancement and management information. As 
an overall result, this pays towards service quality optimisation.  
We follow Deutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct, which includes a complaint handling policy framework to facilitate a consistent 
approach to complaint management, as well as oversight according to regulatory requirements. All complaints must be handled 
fairly, impartially and without undue delay. A client may raise a complaint either directly or through an authorised third party. 
Every complaint against a member of DWS Group must be identified as such and all relevant information must be tracked and 
stored in a durable medium in line with Deutsche Bank’s Record Management Principles, which have been adopted by us. 
Client complaints are reported to DWS and DB Group’s senior management and DB Group Compliance and are subject to 
periodic review by Compliance, Group Audit and our external auditor. Complaint metrics are fed into the Non-Financial Risk 
Report (Operational Risk Management, ORM) oversight reporting and into Deutsche Bank Management Board reporting via 
Deutsche Bank Central Compliance. New complaints are being screened for recurring issues and Management Information 
provides oversight on the type of complaints (clustered by DB Group-wide non-financial risk type taxonomy), materiality/severity, 
and time to closure. 
Information on our complaint process and contact names are provided to clients via the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
(MiFID) Starter Pack and our external website. 
In 2019, DWS has observed an increase in complaints in Germany and Luxembourg. This is almost exclusively related to the 
delivery of the annual tax statement and the declaration of income which was in time from a tax regulatory perspective (before 
July 2019) but late in terms of client expectation and market practice (April to June 2019). The reason for the delay was the final 
letters of the Federal Ministry of Finance on the amendment of the Investment Tax Reform Act and the resulting implementation 
time. We have taken an important governance measure by initiating a globally responsible complaint management function, 
assumed within the Divisional Control Office of DWS. This function coordinates complaints across regions and business areas. In 
this capacity, this function also reports to regulatory bodies. Further complaint filing, -logging and reporting of incidents raised by 
institutional complainants have been centralized in the Customer Relationship Management system called Salesforce. For both 
measures, relevant employees have been trained during 2019.

4.4.2  Client Satisfaction Surveys 
The service centre for our proprietary investment platform is based in Germany, servicing our clients using DWS Direct service 
offerings. This offering is not available in the APAC or Americas regions and enables our German clients and advisors to have 
personal access to the investment platform via telephone or email. Since 2008, we have commissioned an external service 
provider to conduct client satisfaction surveys in order to improve our service quality and client experience. The annual client 
satisfaction survey amongst our clients focuses on perceived service quality, professionalism, and service process transparency 
to ensure client feedback is integrated into our quality assurance and optimisation measures. 
Clients and advisors can rate their satisfaction on topics such as friendliness of staff, response rate, professional competence, 
comprehensibility and solution orientation as well as sales-specific questions. The results are communicated internally by our 
service centre quality management and training team to relevant internal stakeholders, i.e. senior management, service centre 
staff, and the workers' council. Based on the respective feedback, steps for improvement are formulated and incorporated into 
employee training, internal knowledge tools, client correspondence, and client- and advisor-related processes. We maintained 
excellent ratings in advisor satisfaction regarding ‘recommended solutions’, ‘professional competence’ and ‘friendliness’. Further, 
our advisors rated us as ‘likely to recommend our telephone services to colleagues’, which we view as evidence for client loyalty.  
For our U.S. insurance and institutional business, we conduct an annual client satisfaction survey focussing on investment 
performance and other areas of improvement, such as relationship management, innovation and overall satisfaction. Following 
our intentions from last year, client feedback is now fully embedded in senior management sessions with the US Fund Boards. 
Regular client satisfaction surveys are also conducted on a monthly basis by a third party vendor (DST) who services our direct 
retail client base in the U.S. The survey covers knowledge, sincerity, problem solving and overall client satisfaction. 
4.4.3  Third Party Assessment 
In order to achieve a 360-degree view of our services for distribution partners, we also rely on third party quality assessments. 
Our institutional business is evaluated by TELOS, a representative survey for institutional investors, which - amongst other topics 
- assesses client satisfaction and loyalty, quality of product suite, service, and reporting. Asset managers are not only assessed in 
comparison to their individual peer group but also within the wider industry. In line with the results from the previous year, DWS 
again achieved very good scores in TELOS 2019 survey. Especially in the categories overall customer satisfaction, customer 
loyalty and the newly established category on sustainability and ESG, DWS ranks above average. 
4.5  Digitisation and Innovation 
We are committed to being a leader in the digital space and view ourselves as a technology-led and data-driven company. We 
use technology to transform our digital capabilities in business, IT, operations, control functions and marketing. 
Our approach to digitisation and innovation are twofold. We distinguish between digitisation in internal processes and operations 
and in our external distribution strategies. This is also reflected in the responsibilities of our Executive Board Members. The Chief 
Operating Officer (COO) leads our ambitions to digitise and automate our internal processes and our Head of EMEA Coverage 
leads our group wide digital distribution strategy. Both are members of our Executive Board. 
Our approach to digitisation and innovation is outlined in the following by examples of our digitised processes and capabilities.  
4.5.1  Internal Digital Processes 
In 2019, we investigated with selected Software as a Service (SaaS) providers potential partnership options around advanced 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for investment management and portfolio construction purposes. Such efforts are strongly connected 
with our other digital, automation and data initiatives.  
For example, our digital foundations are continuously evolving and through the establishment of a dedicated digital framework, 
we have created a foundation for our internal technology development and taken the next step on our digital journey. Our Digital 
Framework is cloud ready, scalable and provides the digital foundation which underpins DWS architecture going forward.  
DWS data analytics and science capabilities have also matured during 2019, delivering data driven-insight into DWS products, or 
peers and the broader global market. This capability will initially drive our product teams and sales initiatives, however future 
capabilities will look to leverage and build on this foundation to provide greater value, e.g. machine learning. 
41 
 
 
DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
Connected to the above, we adopted a number of cloud-based applications where we partnered with a leading software company 
to better support our reporting to institutional clients, helping us to foster digital distribution benefiting our sales and marketing 
activities. We are also taking additional measures through targeted investments into cloud technology replacing non-cloud 
solutions which we will continue doing in 2020.  
4.5.2  External Digital Marketing 
Building on the global strategy defined for digital marketing and the overriding goal of efficiency and consistency, focus of 2019 
was particularly on consolidating our technical website platforms to ensure the highest possible quality, reusability and scalability. 
The successful migration of seven additional websites to the strategic website platform enabled us to make further progress 
towards this goal. 
In addition, an improved search function and a revised navigation structure were developed to enable our users to find specific 
content more easily. In addition, data-driven solutions in the form of initial personalization functions and recommendation 
algorithms were implemented with the aim of making the user experience of our websites more effective. Especially in product 
search, these solutions can already help our users to find desired results faster and with less effort.   
In the area of inbound marketing (campaigns including advertising in social networks and search engines, marketing automation, 
customer relationship management (CRM) integration), the focus was on reaching our target groups even better and displaying 
relevant content tailored to them. Through improved data integration with marketers and the implementation of dynamic 
advertising technologies, we now achieve a personalized approach and a more efficient creation process. 
In the coming years, we will continue to focus on consolidating our system landscape. In addition, the focus will be on the 
continuous improvement of the user experience, for which purpose data-driven personalization functions on the platform and in 
campaign management in particular will be further developed - always with the long-term goal of being able to provide our users 
with content relevant to them at any time and on any channel.   
The majority of our applications and systems are located in a data centre with a state-of-the-art infrastructure. The centre is 
certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 Energy and Environmental Management System and uses 100% renewable energy, 
including hydro, solar and wind power. 
For all systems and digital implementations used in digital marketing, we continue to implement the policies and procedures 
defined by our technology department as well as the data protection regulations of the respective jurisdictions.

DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
4.6  Designing Products for our Clients 
Our financial performance depends particularly on the ability to develop, market and successfully manage new attractive 
investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovation 
on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. If our products are 
unsuitable or inappropriate for our clients or the target market, we could face potential liability towards them.  
Our products and investment solutions are designed to meet current and future client needs. We seek to ensure that the product 
is designed in such a way that its product features (return expectations, liquidity, diversification or hedging benefits) provide value 
to our clients. We seek to produce transparent, accessible products that are beneficial to the individual without being detrimental 
to the world at large. 
ESG data is the cornerstone of our ESG analysis. Our ESG Engine allows automated and bespoke screenings for all kind of 
clients. The information provided by the ESG Engine is available to all of our portfolio managers and analysts, allowing them to 
access qualitative sustainability parameters alongside traditional financial data. This means that they can easily integrate the 
information into their detailed analysis and embed it into the management of active and passive mandates for all liquid asset 
classes. The data and the results of our analysis are available for all mutual funds for private investors, as well as for individual 
products and strategies for institutional clients. Dedicated ESG funds should help clients to find appropriate investment solutions 
which are in line with regulatory requirements derived e.g. by the EU taxonomy or local authorities. As soon as there is more 
guidance about this, we will analyse the existing product offering and identify the likely impact of an amended and more detailed 
ESG regulation. 
4.6.1  Product strategy framework 
We use regional Client- and Product Strategy to align all strategies and campaigns across Coverage and the Investment Platform 
in EMEA and APAC. When formulating a product strategy it is essential to proactively address global trends and to position a 
suitable product range where our clients can benefit from these global trends. These can be e.g. general ESG aspects, 
technology (digitisation, automation or robotics), environmental aspects (climate change, renewables or circular economy) or 
changing demographics (e.g. healthcare sector). Dedicated ESG funds undergo the full product strategy process. 
We illustrate the entire process in the following graphic, which demonstrates the lifecycle in a cross-functional interaction across 
our various teams. 
 
Step 1: The idea generation phase is the first step of the product lifecycle management process. Step 1 should ensure a proper 
matching of client needs, market developments and corporate strategy and enable a mutual development of the product plan and 
measurement how the plan is being executed. This approach is in principle adopted globally. In order to accommodate regional 
and legal particularities and differences in product structures, the process is regionally adapted with variations in responsibilities. 
True partnership and beneficial cooperation between Product, Coverage and Product Platform to facilitate a strategic product 
planning and review process allows the business to further cultivate, maintain and improve consumer satisfaction, which 
subsequently strengthens the power of DWS in the market. 
Step 2: Once the product / strategy idea has been generated and prioritized, the product design will be specified and checked for 
its feasibility.  
43 
 
 
DWS   4  –  Clients and Products   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
Step 3: The Product Platform team is responsible for the product governance process across the product life cycle and has set up 
a Product Governance Committee (PGC) to provide the respective DWS entity management boards and committees with an 
educated analysis for the approval or rejection of product initiatives. By doing so the process ensures that DWS delivering the 
right product to the clients so that the product features best fit of the clients’ needs. For Liquid Real Alternatives, the Product 
Development Committee assumes this role in various stages.  
Step 4: Once the investment idea has been approved and the decision to start the design of a product made, the product can be 
launched. The PGC conducts analysis, screening and due diligence of product-related initiatives. This includes the introduction, 
assessment and optimisation of any product launches, material product changes, product mergers and liquidations. Decisions 
taken in the PGC aim to consider all implications for DWS along the value chain, and in EMEA/APAC include legal and regulatory 
requirements. Head of Product Platform for EMEA and APAC reports to the Executive Board and chairs the PGC. The attendees 
includes the Business Control Officer and representation from Investment, Coverage, Legal, Compliance, Risk, and Operations.  
In the US, the PGC is chaired by the Global Co-Head of Product Strategy, who reports to the Regional Head of the Americas (an 
Executive Board member). Legal and regulatory requirements are assessed in conjunction with the separate Americas New 
Product Approval (NPA) Panel.   
While this review and risk assessment process puts our clients’ and investors’ interests first it also includes an assessment of 
reputational risk. Reputational risk cannot be precluded, and is driven by unforeseeable changes in the perception of practices by 
various stakeholders such as the public, clients, shareholders and regulators. We strive to promote sustainable standards that will 
enhance profitability and minimise the risk that any association, action or inaction is perceived by stakeholders to be inappropriate 
or inconsistent with our values and beliefs. In order to comply with our fiduciary obligations, we have DWS-specific procedures in 
relation to reputational risk matters, as outlined in our respective reputational risk procedures. These procedures are owned by 
our Non-Financial Risk Management team.  
Step 5: Product analytics supports senior management (e.g. Investment Platform, Coverage and legal entities / fund boards) by 
providing analytics / signals (e.g. performance issues, competitor trends, peer comparison, identification of loss making products) 
to enable better identification and facilitate reaction to client needs and behaviours. The ongoing task is to analyse products and 
performance and develop methods and processes to conduct efficient analytics for senior management. The team reports the 
outcomes of flow and performance analysis to the Executive Board on a quarterly basis. The performance and “health checks” of 
our products is discussed monthly with portfolio management. The Investment Quality Management team conducts the analysis. 
As a result of our Product Lifecycle Management approach, we have worked on various product initiatives in 2019. We have 
among other initiatives successfully launched and positioned thematic equity strategies and launched new products, which focus 
on AI, climate technology, green bonds or the UN’s SDGs. Our Passive team successfully positioned six new ESG ETFs, while 
our Alternatives team worked on continuing the success of the Pan European Infrastructure Fund series by preparing to launch 
PEIF II in 201941. 
ESG, as an important part of the product strategy value chain, is part of the general Product Lifecycle Approach. For dedicated 
ESG strategies it´s mandatory that they are compliant with our ESG Minimum standards. The efficient life cycle management of 
the ESG product suite takes into account the following needs and requirements: (a) definition of flagship strategies and their 
reflection of the value proposition, (b) dedicated funds are aligned with the appropriate customer base, size of the asset class, 
expected flows and the regulatory framework, (c) development of individual product solutions responding to specific investment 
needs and values in close collaboration with strategic distributions partners and clients, (d) development of bespoke investment 
solutions based on specific requirements. 
The current ESG product strategy developed by Investment Specialists in close cooperation with the ESG CIO Office and GCG is 
composed of following four areas: 
(1) ESG “mirroring” of flagship funds / capabilities 
_  Build a product set up which enables clients to choose between a “traditional” (non ESG dedicated) and “ESG” version of 
flagships across different assets classes in the liquid space (Active, Passive, Liquid Real Assets); at present we have 18 ESG 
“mirror” funds across Active Equity, Fixed Income, Multi Asset and Passive 
_  Identify any gaps in product range and review existing products to identify those not aligned to a target market.

− The portfolio implementation is being executed through a smooth and seamless process which also includes outstanding 
service like customized reporting, eKPIs, ESG Performance Attribution, Analysis of unintended risks and risk premia, reporting 
on ESG related performance / risks / factor exposure / tilts.  
4.6.2  New Product Approval and Systematic Product Review 
[GRI 102-11] 
A structured Product Governance process as well as the NPA and the Systematic Product Review (SPR) processes provide the 
basis for ensuring that we can confidently offer clients our products and services. We have created this framework to manage the 
risks associated with the implementation of new products and services, changes in products and services during their life cycles, 
and, the process by which they are systematically reviewed, to ensure they remain fit for purpose and consistent with the needs, 
characteristics and objectives of their intended market(s) throughout their lifespan. Applicable across all and regions divisions, the 
respective processes cover different stages of the product life cycle review, with the NPA process focussing on pre-
implementation and the SPR process on periodic reviews, post implementation. 
For the due diligence on environmental, social or corporate governance risks of dedicated ESG products, our sustainability office 
provides a sign-off. Although sustainable investing is becoming the norm across the active, passive and alternative spaces, some 
asset classes are still more readily associated with ESG than others. In 2019, for example, ESG data has been used much more 
frequently for equities than for fixed income. New funds launched have been “DWS Invest ESG Global Emerging Markets” or 
“DWS Invest ESG European Small/Mid Cap”. 
4.6.3  Product Design and Demographic Change 
We believe that our investment platform is well-positioned to address market trends. As outlined in section 4.4.1 “Product 
Lifecycle Management”, global industry trends are thoroughly analysed by the different regional Client and Product Strategy 
teams. This provides our product functions with a strong knowledge of how to best position our product offerings.  
As a result of demographic shifts over the recent years, ‘baby-boomers’ and ‘millennials’ form an increasingly important client 
group for us. With the baby boomer generation approaching retirement, we are seeing greater demand for sophisticated 
retirement solutions, which has triggered growth in outcome-oriented products such as multi asset. We aim to provide innovative 
solutions to address these retirement needs and old age provisioning, and we are also leveraging our expertise in customising 
pension products to develop the next generation of retirement solutions.  
We have also been developing our digital solutions to meet the preferred investment demand of the millennial generation. As 
outlined in section 6.1.3 “Digitisation and Innovation”, we have enhanced our range of thematic funds to target new growth 
opportunities from this younger investor group (e.g. DWS Invest SDG Global Equities or DWS Invest ESG Climate Tech).

5  Our Impact on Climate Change 
As part of its responsibility as a corporate citizen, DWS manages and minimises the environmental impact of its business 
operations. A comprehensive sustainability strategy was developed with a strong focus on business travel, real estate and 
procurement which are key aspects for DWS’ environmental responsibility.  
The setup of a project covering all key areas at DWS to assess the recommendations and implications of TCFD (Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures) has been an essential part to embed sustainability into corporate services in 2019. Goal of 
our initiative is to set up and amend existing structures and processes in order to accelerate the integration of sustainability 
considerations into our business operations. Our overall ambition is to provide transparency to stakeholders, and to reduce our 
future CO2 footprint. 
5.1  Journey to implement Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures 
[GRI 201-2] 
Climate change is one of the most pervasive issues of our time. The transition to an economy with much lower carbon emissions 
will be shaped not just by the increasingly visible real-world effects of climate change but also by changes in policies, 
technologies, consumer preferences and market norms. Higher taxes on carbon emissions and litigation, for example, can 
increase companies' operating costs or change the demand for their products and services. Technology development can make 
incumbent companies uncompetitive. We have a long track record in measuring the impact of ESG topics on our business. We 
believe that TCFD will help us to identify climate-related risks and opportunities and that TCFD will play a key role to achieve the 
Paris climate goals. Since December 2017, DWS has been an official supporter of the TCFD recommendations and since 2008 
DWS is a signatory of PRI. Therefore, understanding and measuring climate-related impacts on our business have become a key 
priority for DWS. 
As a PRI signatory, DWS is committed to the implementation of TCFD recommendations encompassing the key themes of TCFD: 
Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Metrics & Targets. In 2019, we have included a Climate Transition Risk Rating 
(CTRR) in our ESG Engine which is based on carbon intensity. With “CTRR” we can identify climate laggards and frontrunners 
within our traditional asset classes. Our CTRR is a starting point being used in obtaining insights for product groups with 
alleviated risks stemming from climate transition. 
Within the “ESG Regulatory Governance” Program, the TCFD recommendations were assessed in more detail to provide regular 
updates to the involved stakeholders and to conduct TCFD deep dive session. The aim is to establish processes by developing a 
common understanding with respect to TCFD across different departments, identifying next steps and specifying roles and 
responsibilities within DWS on the basis of the adjustments to the organisational structure already decided. For a more detailed 
description please refer to our chapter “Our company-wide Sustainability Strategy””. 
Several next steps were identified and we will continue to work on those topics in 2020 in order to progress our climate-related 
disclosures in line with the TCFD recommendations. 
Our Environmental Footprint
5.2   
[GRI 305-1; 307-1; 308-1] 
DWS measures and reports GHG emissions based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard Revised reporting boundary. This 
includes all key businesses and sites where DWS is presented.  
Based on an analysis in 2019, we came to the conclusion that DWS did not have material scope 1 or 2 emissions. DWS 
properties consist primarily of offices and branches leased under long-term rental agreements (operating leases) where we do not 
have ownership. Therefore, the consumption of purchased electricity, district heating and cooling as well as emissions associated 
with natural gas combustion are categorized as scope 3. 
48 
 
 
DWS   5  –  Our Impact on Climate Change 
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
Within scope 3, DWS considers investments as a significant source of carbon emissions and we will further assess opportunities 
to quantify the investment emissions. Therefore, current scope 3 emission figures are excluding investments. Further sources for 
scope 3 emissions are   
−  business travel,  
−  leased assets, mainly real estate as described above and fleet management,  
−  waste generated in operations,  
−  purchased services.  
Business travel 
CO2e emissions from business travel arose mainly from air travel. Therefore, it is our aim to assess options to reduce business 
travel and to promote an environmentally responsible mode of travel, for example by shifting from air to train travel. 
Real estate and waste generated in operations 
Emissions and waste from real estate operations are managed by DB Group. Given building occupancy is split across multiple 
Deutsche Bank businesses, calculating DWS specific emissions and waste data is not possible. We are striving to reduce the 
amount of waste we produce, and to reduce water as well as paper consumption. In this context, we plan a global initiative in 
order to change staff printing habits and to promote responsible paper consumption. In addition, we intend to reduce paper-based 
client communication through an increased use of electronic communication channels.  
Fleet management 
Company cars are provided by DB Group as lessee of the fleet and DWS is planning to introduce hybrid and e-cars in 2020. 
Since DWS does not have ownership of or financial control over the fleet, emissions associated with company cars are reported 
as scope 3 (equivalent to emissions associated with other types of business travel). CO2e emissions from fleet management 
amounted to ca. 2,600 t CO2e in 2019.42  
In order to foster greener and more sustainable ways of commuting, we are working on a program to offer e-bikes to our 
employees.  
Purchased services 
The supplier portfolio comprises approximately 2,500 vendors and we follow DB Group policies and procedures to manage our 
vendor population. All our vendors are subject to a risk-based segmentation and vendors classified as posing an important, 
significant or critical risk undergo a comprehensive VRM assessment. All risk types are evaluated in this process including the DB 
Group Sustainability function’s assessment of environmental and social factors. In addition to VRM, all vendors with material 
annual spend, are also subject to a procurement Request for Proposal (RFP) process that includes an assessment of their 
commitment to sustainable development and environmental responsibility.   
Carbon neutrality 
Our unavoidable carbon emissions from building energy use, leased vehicles and business travel are offset by the purchase and 
retirement of high quality emission reduction certificates as part of the carbon neutral activities by Deutsche Bank. 
Our ambitions are to achieve a CDP rating in 2020 and to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 as well as our scope 3 emissions on 
which we have an influence such as business travel.

[GRI 108-8] 
DWS recognizes the importance of its human resources and understands that the success of DWS largely depends on the 
commitment, ideas and engagement of our organization. Therefore, it seeks to create a working environment in which people can 
be innovative, work in partnership and are enabled to deliver long term organizational performance. 
In 2019, there have been four key areas of focus: 
−  Organisation culture with specific focus on feedback culture and investment in developing our employees through training  
−  Appropriate pay for performance through development of the remuneration strategy  
−  Organisational governance & enablement 
−  Organisation design

 [GRI 102-8; 102-35; 401-2] 
Culture Strategy 
We place great importance on our DWS People Survey and feedback culture. Employee feedback is highly valued and is 
testament to strong engagement. 63% of our workforce shared their thoughts with us which was up 20% on last year. In total, 
responses to 40 out of 53 questions asked in last year’s survey have improved this year, with responses confirming that DWS is 
becoming a better place to work. Notably, there is a growing sense of pride across our organisation. This is matched by a desire 
to go above and beyond expectations as we continue to position ourselves as a distinct, publicly-listed asset manager. Our 
commitment to improving workplace conditions has enabled our employees to make better use of their skills and ensure 
information is readily available to carry out their roles effectively.

Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
In terms of our feedback culture, there has been a marked improvement in the ability to share recommendations or concerns with 
managers and regular team meetings. This has resulted in employees feeling better equipped to report unethical behaviour and 
more comfortable to speak up. Communicating openly has also allowed them to better manage risk without having to compromise 
our organizational policies. However, giving and receiving feedback, both positive and negative, as well as sharing appreciation 
with colleagues on all levels remains an area for improvement 
In addition, we also engage with people through multiple People Engagement (PEG) sessions, DWS Executive Talks, Learning 
Bites, Breakfast and Connect and Managing Director Open Door sessions – all of which are crucial in creating a motivational 
workplace. 
Workforce trends are driving the people practice roadmap and some of the progress we have made since the start of the year 
includes: 
−  Thinking more innovatively and further investing in AI, machine learning and data analytics to better understand our client 
needs – acquiring a stake in Arabesque S-Ray and establishing our DWS Innovation Hub and Robo advisory platforms are 
three ways we are being proactive in this space; 
−  Shaping our culture and strategy from the next generation’s perspective by capturing their insights, knowledge and expertise 
across different topics – this has been the driving force behind the launch of our DWS NextGen Advisory Group which is a 
forum of ‘the next generation’ with direct linkage to senior management . This group is currently involved in most of the 
strategic priorities with specific focus on the new Functional Role Framework 
−  Creating new opportunities to broaden skill-sets, networks and experiences – to do this we launched the HotJobs internal 
mobility initiative; 
−  Being more efficient and embracing greater standardisation – e.g. by optimising our vendor costs;  
−  Modernising our technology through the introduction of our market-leading, cloud based HR platform Workday. 
Staff Training 
To help our employees develop professionally and personally and advance their careers, the talent agenda is of great 
importance. Staff budget for 2019 for permanent employees was EUR 3 million, which equates to EUR 750 per person on a per 
head basis. Additionally, in 2020, budget has been allocated centrally for the People Engagement Groups (PEG) and the 
NextGen Advisory Group.  
Graduates and vocational trainees 
We remain committed to the strategic priority of hiring graduates as they contribute to our agenda of change, sustainability, 
reflecting our future clients, and the diversity of our organization. In 2019, we hired 29 graduates (2018:30).  
For the second time, DWS ran two separate orientation and training programs – one for DWS’s Technology cohort and another 
for the remaining graduates, as in previous years. The training takes place over four weeks in London consisting of intensive 
education on the asset management industry.  
Vocational training and dual studies are an important component of our junior staff strategy and offer an additional opportunity, 
particularly in Germany, to attract young talent to our company. In 2019, we hired 4 new vocational trainees (2018: 4). 
Leadership development 
Over the last few years we have successfully run leadership development programs in partnership with Deutsche Bank. As part of 
our commitment to keep our leaders ‘fit for the future of work’, in 2019 there have been significant changes and improvements in 
how we develop our leaders – who are of course a key part of the organization’s culture and transformation. 
The Leadership Capability Model defines what we expect from our leaders, as well as providing a shared view of the capabilities 
that are vital to leading employees and ensuring business success in line with our strategy and culture. In 2019, the language has 
been refreshed and concepts simplified to reflect the changing future of work, the requirements of a leader in this digital age and 
our strategy.  
In October 2019, a new approach to leadership development was piloted, which is built on a more flexible, user focused model. 
Panels of leaders across the organization have helped to design learning which comes in a more bite size format, removing large 
long programs, and replacing those with short learning workshops, including virtual alternatives for small locations. These are 
embedded in learning journeys which include articles, videos, podcasts and other online resources. This will evolve further - 
52 
 
 
DWS   6  –  People Strategy and Attractive Employer   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
including piloting virtual coaching for leaders of complex teams – to ensure leadership development is available at the moment of 
need. 
New first-time leaders are a key focus for us, helping them to grow into a new role (or acclimatize themselves to our leadership 
philosophy when we hire them from outside the organization). To this end an interactive tool for leaders helping them to 
understand our processes, culture, key regulatory requirements – and how they support and develop their teams was created, 
which will formally rolled out in DWS from January 2020 onwards. 
A key part of the content of this ‘Welcome to Leadership’ guide relates to our commitment to creating a climate where our 
employees can speak up. In 2019, employees were provided with a created digital guide called a ‘navigator’ to focus on the 
behaviours which underpin a speak up culture. This included signposting them to learning paths of digital resources included 
facilitated virtual classrooms covering topics such as listening and feedback.   
The company’s leaders are now in a position to take care of their own development and select whatever learning content is 
appropriate to them. The new approach means that we can offer learning to all leaders rather than a selected cohort chosen by 
hierarchical criteria. This also means that those who are for example leading in a project context can access the learning also. 
Talent Acceleration 
To help our employees develop professionally and personally and advance their careers, the talent acceleration programs at 
Deutsche Bank, of which DWS benefit, follow a cross-company approach.  
Accomplished Top Leaders Advancement Strategy (ATLAS) is the flagship, highly visible acceleration program for senior female 
MDs. It was launched in 2009 and since then, there have been 5 cohorts in which DWS participated. The program follows a 12 
month structured development journey with bespoke 1:1 development and is aimed at increasing the number of women in senior 
positions across the bank.  
The Director Acceleration Program had 13 participants from DWS in 2019, with 46 % female representation. It is a 12-month 
program with a blended learning experience and includes classroom and coaching elements.  
The Vice President Acceleration Program completed its fourth year in 2019 and had 30 participants with 47% female 
representation. This program is delivered across 5 regions and offers participants a unique six-month development experience.  
Participants of the Acceleration programs also get exposure to DWS senior management. Executive Board members as well as 
others host respective networking sessions to get to know DWS key talent and discuss matters of importance for DWS and its 
employees. These sessions are highly appreciated and are now an integral part of programs for DWS participants. 
Remuneration Strategy 
Remuneration plays an integral role in the successful delivery of DWS’ strategic objectives. DWS compensation philosophy is 
underpinned by regulatory considerations and is predicated on the principles of ‘pay for performance’, ‘equal & fair pay’, 
‘alignment to DWS Shareholders and Investors’, and ‘enhanced alignment to asset management market practices’ 
In the course of 2019, our compensation framework and governance evolved in the following ways: 
−  In line with DWS Group status as a listed company and increased level of operational independence, we strengthened the 
DWS compensation governance framework by creating several stand-alone DWS compensation governance committees 
following transfer of responsibilities from DB Group 
−  DWS compensation structures are designed to provide mechanisms that promote and support long-term performance of the 
DWS franchise and its employees. As part of DB Group, DWS has a long history of deferring part of variable compensation for 
select employees. The 2018 deferrals for DWS employees were delivered in DWS share based deferred equity awards (DWS 
Restricted Equity Award (REA) to replace DB restricted shares, stand-alone DWS Restricted Incentive (Cash) Plan and DWS 
Fund instruments. DWS continues to enhance these compensation plans. 
−  To achieve increased investor alignment via our pay strategies, we expanded scope of both ‘mandated’ and ‘elective’ 
Employee Investment Plan (EIP) for the DWS deferred staff.  
−  We also implemented InstVV Sectoral ‘Carve Out’, for vast majority of DWS employees applying AIFMD / UCITS pay 
regulations instead. DWS compensation processes such as ‘Material Risk Taker identification’ and DWS compensation plans 
were aligned to AIFMD / UCITS regulations, resulting in shorter DWS deferral / retention periods and removal of statutory 
CRDIV bonus pay caps. 
−  In 2019, DWS published its own stand-alone DWS Compensation Policy, accessible to all DWS employees

Performance Share Units (PSU), granted in 2018 to select key DWS executives deemed key to the execution of our strategy, 
remain in place. The PSU award is subject to achieving specific performance targets aligned to our strategy goals and externally 
committed targets.  
Organisational Governance & Enablement 
2019 also saw increased focus on organisation governance and enablement across 3 areas: 
−  Enhanced governance and review of services received from Deutsche Bank, including alignment and monitoring of service 
costs for appropriateness 
−  Implementation of Workday, a cloud-based human capital management system which provides better, more intuitive self-
service for employees 
−  An enhanced workforce management framework, including increase transparency and review of the DWS workforce 
Further benefits from these will be realized in 2020 and beyond 
Organisational Design 
To continue the work of 2018 and the simplification of the organisation structure, a restructuring programme was initiated and 
implemented in all regions.  
Outlook 
The centrepiece of the People Strategy is the creation of a Functional Role Framework for DWS. 
DWS will deploy this functional role framework by mid-2020, which will change the way we work together as a company, 
replacing corporate titles and hierarchical thinking to foster a clear performance driven culture. The Executive Board took the 
decision to make this change in response to employee feedback for a more simplified corporate structure and to make progress 
changing the culture. The framework will be based on individuals’ capabilities, and designed to empower our employees, 
encourage innovation, unlock performance, and enable the execution of our overall strategy. We view this initiative as pivotal to 
our people development as we consider our employees the most valuable asset of DWS. 
This is one of the most substantial people projects in our organization’s history. This framework is designed to best match roles to 
the needs of our organization and, most important, to our clients. This will help us to reduce complexity across our business, 
break down barriers and create a more modern work environment. In creating this framework, we will build a collaborative work 
environment with flatter hierarchies based on functional roles, skills and capabilities. Creating a flat, simplified corporate structure 
will enable us to make decisions more efficiently, drive innovation and give employee more accountability and visibility for their 
contributions.  
As part of our framework, each role will have a clearly defined description covering responsibilities and specific expectations and 
priorities. Each functional role will take into account the expertise needed, business impact, team management and expected 
relationships with other parts of the business. The compensation for each role will be aligned accordingly. This will provide each 
employee with a better understanding of the career options and pathways available, and career progression across the firm will 
now take place throughout the course of the year rather than being restricted to a single annual cycle. 
By removing hierarchical barriers we will be able to mature into an agile, globally competitive asset manager that attracts, retains 
and develops the very best people. This change will further support us as we focus on emerging growth opportunities and mega-
trends, accelerate our digital efforts and ensure that Sustainability, alongside our other core values of Integrity, Excellence and 
Entrepreneurialism, is at the heart of everything we do. 
6.3  Diversity & Equal Opportunities  
[GRI 405-1] 
As a global organization, DWS is committed to an inclusive culture that respects and embraces the diversity of our employees, 
clients, and communities. As diversity and inclusion are central to the firm’s culture, our continuous focus is to: 
−  Build talented and diverse teams to drive business results; 
−  Create a respectful and inclusive environment where people can thrive; 
54 
 
 
DWS   6  –  People Strategy and Attractive Employer   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
−  Strengthen our relationship with clients, partners, regulators, communities, and potential employees. 
We aim to attract, develop, and retain the best people from all cultures, countries, races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, 
abilities, beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. To this end, and to prepare for opportunities and challenges arising from 
changing demographics, digitalization, and the future of work, we follow an integrated and multi-dimensional approach to diversity 
and inclusion. 
Throughout 2019, DWS continued its journey to embed diversity and inclusion in our business and people practices. Key focus 
areas in 2019 were: 
−  Establishing our commitment to improve gender diversity. DWS set voluntary goals at the Supervisory Board and Executive 
Board-1 and Executive Board-2 levels per the German Gender Quota Law. Gender diversity is one of the KPIs that we are 
tracking internally. 
−  Improving diversity through talent attraction: Embedding diversity into the renewed Employee Value Proposition which will be 
implemented in 2020, targeted campaigns to attract more women to DWS, and projects to attract and retain people across 
generations. 
−  Strengthening the cross-generational collaboration and dialogue: Creation of the Next Gen Advisory Group, Regional 
Employee Resource Group driven Reverse Mentoring programs and wider platform based Reverse Mentoring offerings. 
−  Advancing LGBTQI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex) inclusion worldwide: Honouring 50 years of 
LGBTQI Pride worldwide and taking our responsibility to both business and society serious by, e.g., intensifying the work with 
coalitions and influential platforms that advocate for a more inclusive and just world. 
6.3.1  Continuing our focus on gender diversity 
The percentage of women on the Supervisory Board stood at 36 % at the end of the year (2018: 36%), which met the statutory 
requirement of 30 % for listed and co-determined German companies under gender quota legislation. 
As of year-end 2019, 21.5 % of the executive positions at the first management level below the Executive Board were held by 
female executive women (2018: 23%). At the second level below the Executive Board, this percentage stood at 26.8% (2018: 
26 %). In accordance with legal requirement in Germany, DWS set targets for December 31, 2021, of 26 % and 29%, 
respectively. 
While women’s representation at DWS is not yet where we want it to be, we continue to monitor and report on our progress to the 
Executive Board. We have a variety of measures in place including talent development programs, manager training, best 
practices on people-related decisions, internal monitoring, and significant support for grassroots, employee-driven initiatives. We 
believe improved gender balance in leadership roles will meaningfully contribute to the future success of DWS. 
In the UK, Deutsche Bank published its second Gender Pay Gap report in compliance with UK legislation that came into force in 
April 2017, requiring all companies with 250 or more employees to report their gender pay gap annually. DWS was included in 
this data. The median hourly pay gap has narrowed slightly in our combined UK figures (from 27.6% to 27.2%). The increase in 
median bonus pay gap for 2018 compared to 2017 (35.4% to 67.7%) is due to Individual Variable Compensation being paid in 
March 2018, in respect of performance year 2017. Further root cause analysis regarding seniority, profession, and business 
division of women versus men are published together with actions to reduce the gap. The third Gender Pay Gap report reflecting 
2019 will be issued March 2020.  
In Germany, the German Remuneration Transparency Act, which came into force in January 2018, offers employees the right to 
request specific aggregated information about the remuneration of colleagues of the opposite gender in comparable jobs. In 
2019, 11 colleagues (of which 91% women and 9% men) made use of this right, with no structural discrepancies identified (2018: 
26 colleagues, of which 64 % women and 36 % men). As a global company active in many areas, DWS generally strives for a 
cross-regional approach and transparency. We will continue to thoroughly analyse the results from the various initiatives and 
remain committed to reducing any gaps. Furthermore, we will take these considerations into account in the further development 
of our compensation framework. 
6.3.2  Creating an inclusive work environment 
For the first time in 2018, Deutsche Bank made the list of the top 100 most inclusive companies on the Thomson Reuters D&I 
Index and DWS was included in these results.  Now in its third year, this investable index is informed by ESG data and evaluates 
companies on various components of inclusion. Deutsche Bank ranks #68 of all the 2,173 companies evaluated. This puts us in 
the top 100, which is the investible index referenced. In the banking services category, we ranked fourth out of 185 companies 
and sixth out of 84 German companies.

As one of many activities to support LGBTQI inclusion and to support the firm’s LGBTQI colleagues, DWS in partnership with 
Deutsche Bank has a long-standing Allies program. These visible Allies, who do not self-identify with a particular LGBTQI group, 
play a key role to foster a culture of inclusion across the bank. As leaders and advocates of change at all levels of the 
organization they are helping LGBTQI employees to feel safe at work, to bring their whole self to work, and subsequently also to 
be more productive. 
DWS has also developed a number of key external partnerships across the globe. These partnerships not only help us to drive 
our internal agenda. They also enable us to share good practice and to positively impact on the societies we are operating in. We 
are convinced that his helps us to strengthen relationships with clients, partners, and communities. 
−  Partnership and Sponsorship with the 30% Club and the Diversity Project with the goal of increasing our female talent in senior 
leadership roles. 
−  Membership with New Financial, a UK diversity think tank specific to the Asset Management industry, to further drive and 
create an inclusive culture. 
−  DWS is also leading the Diversity pillar with CFOs of leading Asset Managers, hosted by Ernst & Young. 
−  Sponsorship of the Foundsfrauen initiative in Germany

6.4  Employee Wellbeing 
At DWS enabling employee wellbeing is a core part of our People Strategy. For our people to stay healthy and engaged, perform 
well and thrive in their professional and personal lives we seek to provide an overall employment experience conducive to 
maintaining their wellbeing. This focuses on employees’ mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing and includes 
comprehensive benefit programs in all our locations. 
Mental and physical wellbeing44 
Our benefits offering in 12 counties, including all of our main hubs, includes preventative medical examinations for physical and 
mental health, fitness and nutrition. Feedback indicates that such examinations contribute to improvements in health and overall 
wellbeing.  
Our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) supports employees to deal with issues in their personal and professional lives by 
offering confidential 24/7 support hotlines, which are staffed by counsellors and/or psychologists and offer advice on family 
relationships, stress management and other issues. The EAP, in many locations such as Germany, the UK, the US, Japan and 
Hong Kong, also serves as an important resource in crisis situations, such as natural disasters, epidemics or other threats to 
public safety. 
We offer a wide range of mental health resources aimed at reducing the stigma associated with mental health and providing 
support both to those affected and to those closest to them. As an example, there is a focus in internal communications on ‘World 
Mental Health Day’ each year, enabling DWS to raise awareness about mental health in the workplace in various locations across 
the globe.  
We also ensure we provide safe places to work and conduct business for our employees, clients and other visitors. We believe 
that integrating sound environment, health and safety (EHS) practices into our business has multiple positive effects, including 
contributing to improving quality and productivity in the workplace and increasing employee job satisfaction. 
Our health rate for employees working in Germany was 95.1% for 2019. 
                                                           
44 Please note: International standards for Human resource management recommend disclosing metrics reflecting lost time injuries, number of occupational accidents 
and number of people killed during work. These type of serious incidents rarely occur in our operating environment and are more relevant to the safety related report-
ing of other industries.

Financial and Social wellbeing 
In addition to competitive compensation, we offer pension plans which complement social security and private savings. For 
example, in Germany, this consists of an employer-financed pension plan, matched contributions to the BVV Versicherungsverein 
des Bankgewerbes a. G (BVV) industry-wide plan; and the option to convert parts of compensation into pension contributions. 
Similar schemes exist for employees in most locations worldwide. In many other locations including the UK, US, Hong Kong, 
Japan, Singapore and Australia, we also offer comprehensive insurance programs including medical and life insurance. 
We provide a range of benefits to help our employees manage professional and personal commitments and achieve a healthy 
work-life balance. In most locations, progressive and family-friendly parental leave policies have been established, with increasing 
emphasis on a more gender neutral approach.  
To accommodate employees’ needs and offer flexibility, working from home, working part-time and job-sharing opportunities are 
all generally available, subject to specific role requirements, regulatory or client needs. In addition, DWS offers a variety of paid 
and unpaid leave to allow employees to manage special unforeseen events, e.g. personal or immediate family illness or injury 
and bereavement of immediate family members. 
In the UK, we offer a flexible benefits programme which enables employees to select individual benefits which are most suited to 
their lifestyle needs

Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
7  Risk Management, Compliance and Control 
7.1  Risk and Control Framework and Organization 
[GRI 102-17] 
The Chief Control Office (CCO) is the independent function responsible for protecting the DWS Group’s business as well as being 
a trusted advisor and partner for supporting sustainable business growth.  
The management of financial risks, non-financial risks and investment risks including the compliance with all regulatory 
requirements and minimum standards established for these risks is of highest importance for DWS Group.  
Therefore, the risk management and control framework established reflects this variety of risk types within the organizational 
structure of the Chief Control Office. It comprises among others functions responsible for the management of non-financial risks 
(operational risks and reputational risks), financial risks, as well as investment risks, to which investors of products manufactured 
and managed by DWS Group are exposed.  
DWS Group Risk & Control Governance 
DWS Group’ activities and operations in different jurisdictions are regulated and supervised by the respective competent 
authorities in each jurisdiction. For further information on the Governance Structure please refer to the DWS Risk Report. 
Besides the DWS Group’s governance, an additional integral part of the governance structure is the regional aspect. To that end, 
dedicated regional risk governance forums, committees or boards have been established and tailored to the specific regional 
regulatory requirements. Their role is to primarily oversee and manage risk profiles, function as the escalation body and act as 
the central point for risk matters to various internal and external stakeholders such as senior management, clients and regulators. 
Managing Risks and the Three Lines of Defence Model  
As a global fiduciary business, a strong governance framework enables DWS Group to establish an effective risk management, 
compliance and control infrastructure. This includes risk management processes such as risk identification, risk management and 
evaluation, risk monitoring and mitigation as well as accountability and a culture of compliance and risk awareness across all 
three lines of defence. 
−  The first line of defence (1LoD - the business, its management and Chief Operating Office organization) typically owns and 
manages risks through level 1 controls and an annual risk and control assessment. It implements and owns processes and is 
responsible for mitigation of related risks identified. 1LoD functions are accountable for all risks in their business. They take an 
end-to-end process view managing these risks, including identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting on these 
risks relative to risk appetite. Each 1LoD team is responsible for designing and implementing level 1 controls to mitigate risks 
and to adhere to legal, regulatory and policy requirements. While the 1LoD may take risk decisions, they must always ensure 
controls are reasonably designed to adhere to applicable rules and DWS policies. 1LoD must take immediate action to 
address such breaches and may not “risk accept” violations of rules. 
−  The second line of defence (among others the DWS Risk Management functions, the DWS Compliance function, some 
infrastructure functions and its management) monitors these risks in support of senior management. For the risk types 
identified within the DWS Group risk and control framework, the second line functions operate as risk type controllers. They 
provide a dedicated risk management framework, relevant level 2 controls and reporting and escalation processes. The 
second line functions establish jointly with senior management a risk appetite framework in line with the company’s business 
strategy. They independently assess and monitor the company’s risk profile against agreed risk appetite and the effectiveness 
of level 1 controls in mitigating these risks. 
−  The third line of defence (internal audit function) provides assurance on the effectiveness of controls in place to mitigate risk. 
This risk management framework shows the importance of an effective risk management and compliance organisation in order to 
safeguard DWS Group’s regulatory compliance, reputation and operational business interests as well as our clients’ best 
interests.  
Although DWS Group has adopted risk management processes and regularly reviews its controls, procedures, systems and 
policies, we are aware that non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations and an inappropriate control framework could 
expose DWS to material financial, regulatory and/or reputational risk.

DWS   7  –  Risk Management, Compliance and Control   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
7.2  Risk Management 
Given the risk types identified to be relevant from a risk management perspective, DWS Group Risk Management categorizes the 
material risks into financial risks, non-financial risks and investment risks in the following way:  
−  Financial risk on the corporate level comprises credit risk, non-trading market risk, liquidity risk and strategic risk. 
−  Non-financial risk on the corporate level comprises operational risk and reputational risk. 
−  Investment risk comprises risk at the portfolio level and consists of market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, as well as any 
other risks investors of products managed by DWS Group might be exposed to.   
Given this set of currently identified and managed risk types, a program to integrate sustainability risks and sustainability factors 
into the set of material risk types (across the three major groups of risks) has been initiated in 2019.  
Sustainability Risks and Sustainability Factors 
Over the last years and in particular in 2019, DWS Group has been monitoring the increased attention to the question of the 
integration of sustainability risks in the risk management processes of financial institutions. Among others, the (draft) publications 
of the amendments of the EU regulatory framework as well as publications and recommendations given on NCA level (such as 
the BaFin Leaflet published in December 2019) have been given special focus.  
From DWS Group’s point of view, sustainability risks as well as the underlying sustainability factors cannot simply be seen as one 
additional risk type to be managed and monitored besides the existing risk types. This is due to the fact that sustainability factors 
can have an effect on several of the already known risk types. More precisely, sustainability risks could materialize within any of 
the three groups of risks managed. These factors could materialize for example as follows: 
Investment market risk: Several shares of companies contained within the portfolio of a fund managed by DWS Group could 
operate their business in a non-sustainable way or might be exposed to significant climate change factors. An abrupt change in 
the market view or the materialization of climate change events might lead to devaluations of these shares which ultimately leads 
to losses for investors of the fund.  
Strategic risk: Subsequent to the changes implemented in EU regulations with regards to the EU Action Plan, the product 
portfolio manufactured and managed by DWS Group could potentially no longer meet client expectations with regard to a diverse 
and appropriate offering of sustainable investment products. The redemptions as well as missing subscriptions DWS Group could 
face linked to this situation might expose DWS group to a strategic sustainability risk.  
Reputational risk: The products manufactured by DWS Group labelled with a specific sustainability related label (such as “ESG” 
or “SDG”) could potentially unveil to be only supposedly sustainable products. Besides the potential regulatory fines linked to this 
incident, ESG aware investors could withdraw their money from ESG labelled products or even other products managed by DWS 
group.  
DWS Group considers all of the above cases of potential materialisation of sustainability risk to be relevant for integration into its 
risk management and control framework of DWS Group. Within 2020, DWS intends to formalize the integration of sustainability 
factors and sustainability risks within the risk management framework of DWS Group.  
Corporate Risk Management 
Corporate risks includes the following material categories of risk:  
−  Non-financial risks including reputational risk and operational risk (with important sub-categories such as compliance risk, 
information security risks, technology operations risk, transaction processing, vendor and model risk), and  
−  Financial risks, such as market risk associated with co-investments, seed investments, guaranteed products, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and strategic risk. 
We manage the identification, assessment and mitigation of key risks through an internal governance process and the use of risk 
management tools and processes. We have a clearly defined risk appetite and our approach to identifying and assessing the 
impact aims to ensure that we mitigate the impact of these risks on our financial results, long-term strategic goals and reputation. 
External factors outside the control of DWS Group can have a significant effect. The continued elevated levels of political 
uncertainty worldwide, protectionism and increased tensions regarding trade and tariff negotiations coupled with uncertainty 
around the past-Brexit agreements and the continuation of the current low interest environment could have unpredictable 
60 
 
 
DWS   7  –  Risk Management, Compliance and Control   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
consequences on the global economy, markets and investor confidence, which could lead to declines in business levels and 
could affect our revenues and profits as well as the execution of our strategic plans. 
The assessment of the potential impacts of these risks is integrated into our stress test which assesses our ability to absorb these 
events should they occur. The overall focus of risk management is on maintaining our risk profile in line with our risk appetite, 
increasing our capital base and supporting our strategic management initiatives with a focus on economic capital optimization. 
Integration of Sustainability Risk  
Sustainability risks, or more precisely sustainability factors, have already been part of several of the risk management procedures 
as well as risk assessments performed within DWS Group. More precisely, ESG factors have been part of the reputational risk 
assessment processes where in particular social, environmental as well as sectorial factors have been considered within the 
overall risk assessment of new products manufactured by DWS Group. 
During the course of the assessment performed in 2019, several further financial and non-financial risk types have been identified 
to be impacted by sustainability factors. Besides reputational risks, which have already been reflecting some of the factors, 
strategic risks as well as other sub-types of non-financial risks have been identified to be impacted.  
For 2020, it is therefore planned to integrate sustainability factors into the different frameworks and tools established to measure 
and manage financial and non-financial risks. This implies that risk assessments being performed for non-financial risks, scenario 
analysis and stress testing being performed for strategic risks or the risk appetite statements being defined across all risk types 
will be amended to reflect sustainability risk effects and the underlying sustainability factors. 
Fiduciary Investment Risk Management 
While corporate risk management is assessing the risks DWS Group or its investors are exposed to, the investment risk 
management function manages and monitors the risks the investors in products managed by DWS Group are facing. The 
investment risk management function identifies, assesses, limits and monitors on an ongoing basis the following sub-types of 
Investment Risk: 
Investment market risk: Market risk refers to the risk resulting from an adverse change in the market value (or rate) or forward 
value (or rate) of any investment or underlying to an investment contained within a portfolio managed. Market risk is influenced, 
inter alia, by macro-economic factors such as central bank or government interventions or global economic growth or recessions. 
Both the specific risk of the individual positions and assets as well as the overall risk of the portfolio are considered – aimed at 
protecting investor assets and interests. 
Investment liquidity risk: Liquidity risk is defined as the risk arising from potential inability to meet investor redemptions or other 
liquidity demands. Hence, the liquidity risk management framework considers both the overall ability of the portfolio to generate 
liquidity on the one hand as well as the potential redemption demands considering the liquidity management tools and liquidation 
profile of the product on the other hand.  
Investment Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk is understood as the risk of default of a fund’s counterparty within an OTC 
transaction (e.g. an OTC Swap), an EPMT (Efficient Portfolio Management Technique) or any kind of deposit held by the fund 
with that counterparty. The potential loss incurred by the sub-fund in the event that such default occurs can be as high as the 
positive mark to market value of the transaction. Changes in the price of the underlyings of the transaction and other market 
parameters may affect the transaction price and therefore the level of exposure to counterparty risk. 
Additional alternative investment risks: Whereas market prices are available on a daily basis for traditional assets, alternative 
assets are in most cases much more illiquid, or prices are not directly observable at all. Related risks typically strongly depend on 
the asset class of the product. Prominent examples would be credit risks within the debt originating fund or the risk of default of 
tenants within a real estate fund. In these cases, regular valuations of the assets take place considering these risk factors and the 
risk assessment pays specific attention to these factors. In order to reflect illiquidity in risk management accordingly, 
measurement and control processes are based on monthly or quarterly rather than on daily frequency. 
Other investment risks impacting the fund or its investor: Besides the more traditional risk types monitored within the 
investment risk management framework described above, the investors investing in the products might also be exposed to other 
risks such as operational risks or valuation risks ultimately affecting adversely the value of the shares held by the investors of the 
products. 
Several measurement and management tools are used to manage the individual risk types as well as the aggregated risk profile 
of the products. These tools comprise for example risk profiling and risk limit frameworks on product and risk type level as well as 
61 
 
 
DWS   7  –  Risk Management, Compliance and Control   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
corresponding risk measurement tools such as Value at Risk measurement, stress testing, liquidation profile analysis, leverage 
management, sensitivity analysis and much more. 
Integration of Sustainability Risk in Investment Risks 
Sustainability risk and sustainability factors on a portfolio level have been identified to have the most significant impact on 
investment market risk as well as on additional risk types identified for illiquid alternative asset classes. 
The variety of sustainability factors, which have been identified and which might have an impact on the individual values of assets 
or investments contained in a managed portfolio, lead to the conclusion that a comprehensive measurement and management of 
sustainability risks requires a diverse set of risk indicators and measures. Besides others, the indicators mentioned below have 
been identified to be the most relevant and appropriate to be integrated into the existing investment risk management and 
oversight processes: 
Fund based ratings linked to ESG / Sustainability Risk issuer ratings 
Ratings established on issuer level assessing the effect of diverse sustainability factors on the value of assets issued can be used 
on an individual or combined level to assess the overall sustainability risk profile of a fund. For this purpose, different measures 
such as the concentration of “poorly” rated issues or the average rating profile of a fund can be considered as portfolio level risk 
indicators for sustainability risk. The measures can consist of different types of ratings, including: 
−  Ratings linked to standards-based screening focused on human rights abuses, child or forced labour, health and safety, 
environmental impact, and business ethics 
−  Corporate best-in-class ratings that seek to identify leaders and laggards with regards to ESG issues within a peer group  
−  Environmental risks and opportunities ratings - including carbon price risk ratings, water risk ratings or other transition risk or 
physical climate risk ratings 
Physical climate or transition stress tests 
Besides rating based indicators as described above, stress scenarios or stress tests can be used to assess the exposure and the 
sensitivity of a portfolio towards sustainability risks. The underlying assumptions might again be induced by combinations of 
endogenous or exogenous sustainability factors. Such stress tests can be integrated in the stress testing frameworks already 
established by the Investment Risk function of DWS Group. 
In 2019, the Investment Risk function has started to assess within its market risk oversight processes the ESG risk profiles of the 
actively managed products. Within the regular risk and performance review process between the first line of defence and the 
second line functions (Portfolio Management and Risk Management), the concentration of assets with high sustainability risks 
have been considered within the overall assessment of risk profiles of the products. 
Within 2020, the Investment Risk function plans to extend its analysis to further integrate sustainability risk issuer ratings as well 
as physical and/or climate transition scenarios into its investment risk management process. This is expected to imply amongst 
others the integration of risk limits with respect to various ESG ratings and the usage of these limits as well as escalation 
procedures to the respective governing bodies. Moreover, physical climate stress scenarios as well as climate transition stress 
scenarios are planned to be integrated in the market risk stress testing program executed by the Investment Management 
functions. Additionally, for illiquid alternative asset classes, sustainability risks shall additionally be integrated in the individual risk 
assessments performed on an investment level. 
EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance 
In 2018, the European Commission adopted the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance45 which has the goal to support 
investment in low-carbon and resource efficient technologies and to foster a longer-term outlook. We believe that the EU Action 
Plan on Sustainable Finance will play a key role to achieve the goals from the Paris climate agreement. As a member of the BVI46 
and the EFAMA47, DWS takes an active role in contributing its experience and insights in Sustainable Finance throughout the 
policy and law-making process. Moreover, the DWS Research Institute provides sophisticated insights to share know-how and 
experiences as for instance on the integration of climate transition risk into investment.

Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
In addition to the existing Responsible Investment Leadership Team (RILT), DWS established the ESG Regulatory Governance 
Programme along the entire value chain in 2019 to assess the impact of the new regulatory requirements from the EU Action 
Plan on Sustainable Finance and to review voluntary requirements resulting from PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment) and 
TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure). Until the end of December 2019, a thorough analysis and impact 
assessment were carried out in order to understand the EU Action Plan implications for DWS and to build a strong basis for the 
development of business requirements. A comprehensive governance was established including weekly sessions in which the 
latest regulatory updates and workstream progress were discussed with support of external experts. Moreover, these sessions 
served as an opportunity to exchange relevant information, to present new insights gained at ESG conferences and events, and 
to define action items. The ESG Regulatory Governance Programme also reported the respective implementation status of the 
regulatory requirements on a regular basis to the management board and the respective regional operational committees. DWS 
also participated actively in various consultations by providing as an example a comprehensive feedback on the draft BaFin 
Guidance Notice on Dealing with Sustainability Risks. In 2020, DWS plans to focus on the development of detailed business 
requirements and their implementation. 
7.3  Culture and Conduct 
We apply a Code of Conduct, which sets out our standards of behaviour and conduct to which we expect all of our people to 
adhere to. The basis is a DB Group global conduct risk framework designed to avoid the inappropriate creation of bad outcomes 
for our clients, our firm or the integrity of financial markets through breaches of laws, regulations or internal requirements such as 
our Code of Conduct. This global conduct risk framework defines the principles for oversight over the management of conduct 
risk so that there is timely identification, reporting, escalation and remediation of issues that arise. 
Since our IPO in March 2018, we developed a distinct set of values and corporate culture in order to position ourselves for the 
future. Therefore, our Executive Board identified four values shaping the culture of DWS as a leading asset manager. Culture and 
integrity are an essential cornerstone of a good corporate governance and success for the future. All asset management 
capabilities must be backed by strong and consistent investment performance. Alongside the business reputation, our brand is 
one of the most important assets that our company has. Our brand offers identity, distinguishes the company and its products 
from its competitors, characterises the value of a company and attracts future employees. For additional information on 
composition, choice and governance of our boards and committees, please refer to the Corporate Governance Statement in our 
Annual Report. 
DWS also set out a Culture and Conduct Programme in 2019 that will continue in 2020. While in 2019, it was key to ensure 
alignment between the strategy, the underlying values and the observed actions and behaviour of our employees, in 2020 DWS 
will focus on its Culture Plan and underlying initiatives. 
In 2019, the DWS Culture Plan included various initiatives, which contribute to enhancing understanding of DWS Culture, Identity 
and work environment. All initiatives are designed to focus on employees as the better employees understand the risk attributable 
to their function, product, and business area, the more likely they are to incorporate them into decision making and ethical 
behaviour. In 2019, three initiatives out of the DWS Culture Plan were fully implemented, four initiatives will continue into 2020. 
7.3.1  Dealing with Conflicts of Interest 
Conflicts of interest are inherent to all banking and investment businesses. Failure to recognise and appropriately manage 
conflicts of interest can result in inappropriate or adverse consequences for clients, DWS, and our employees. Every part of DWS 
Group is required to implement a dedicated framework for conflicts of interest in line with the DWS Group Policy for Conflicts of 
Interest, to identify actual and potential conflicts and manage them fairly and appropriately for all involved parties. In DWS, 
conflicts of interests are identified and administered through the respective Chief Operating Officers in the first line of defence and 
Compliance as second line maintains oversight. This includes topics such as employee trading, outside business interests, deal 
logging or conflicts arising from family and close personal relationships. 
An independent DB Group-wide Business Selection and Conflicts Office (BSCO) is responsible for identifying and managing 
transaction related conflicts. It has the mandate to approve or reject business transaction business and annually reports to the 
board on conflicts of interest. 
In 2019, the Framework for dealing with Conflicts of Interest underwent several enhancements following the IPO of DWS Group 
including the dedicated DWS Conflicts of Interest Policy and corresponding Procedures. Additionally, awareness among 
employees was further improved through the roll-out of a dedicated “Managing Conflict of Interest” training module in 2019.

7.3.2  Anti-Competitive Behaviour 
[GRI 206-1] 
The consequences of anti-competitive behaviour could be serious and far-reaching. Our Antitrust Compliance programme defines 
the minimum standards of behaviour for our employees and includes a comprehensive training and control framework for 
identifying and monitoring antitrust risks in order to prevent or mitigate breaches of antitrust laws.  
There have been no pending or completed legal actions against DWS during the reporting period regarding any anti-competitive 
behaviour or violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation in which the organisation has been identified as a participant. 
In 2019, DWS implemented a dedicated DWS Anti-Trust framework including definitions, controls and governance. 
7.4  Anti-Financial Crime - Preventing Fraud and Bribery and 
Corruption 
[GRI 102-25; 205-2] 
The fight against financial crime remains a key priority of the Executive Board and senior management and is embedded across 
the objectives of the DWS business both in terms of the impact of Financial Crime from a reputational perspective and from the 
standpoint of its approach to social responsibility. To ensure DWS can robustly mitigate the risks from criminal behaviour, 
policies, procedures and key controls must be continually reviewed, updated and strengthened through a structured programme 
which at present aligns with the Group Deutsche Bank (DB) programme and approach. This will ensure the business remains 
resilient to the associated inherent risks arising from criminal activity directed at the DWS business either from external third 
parties or from within the business by employees. Two key risks recognised by DWS, are Fraud and Bribery & Corruption. 
DWS continues to take a zero tolerance to Fraud and Bribery & Corruption in line with our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, 
our values and beliefs and international law. Our Fraud and Anti-Bribery & Corruption policy sets out the minimum standards of 
behaviour expected of all employees and third parties.  
Following the developments described in the last year report, and in recognising the need to manage those risks, the dedicated 
DWS Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) function has further expanded its capabilities to include a function dedicated to countering the 
specific threat of Fraud and Bribery and Corruption. Aligned with the existing policies, procedures and key controls framework 
adopted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) Group, which continues in the main to be leveraged by DWS. AFC now has a dedicated 
Anti-Fraud & Bribery & Corruption Team (AFBC) with a global focus across all the regions of the business. From January 2020, 
the DWS Compliance and AFC functions have integrated to become a joint Compliance / AFC function. Senior management are 
informed about the progress of Anti-Fraud & Bribery & Corruption activities via regular and ongoing reporting to the Chief Control 
Officer.  
This function is fully operational and partners with Regulation & Compliance across the entirety of the business to ensure there is 
a regular and ongoing programme of awareness of the risks as well as a relevant and appropriate level of controls assessment on 
an annual basis. For 2019, DWS has adopted a new approach to the assessment of all Financial Crime risks. This has been 
undertaken by developing the previous annual Global Risk Assessment (GRA) methodology to include a revised Risk Type 
Assessment (RTA) aligned to the Non-Financial Risk Taxonomy. This assessment incorporates an entity level assessment of 
both Fraud & Bribery and Corruption risks using a clearly defined methodology with the ultimate aim to identify and measure 
areas of risk and identify key controls and any existing controls which may require development based on the activities of the 
business. 
This assessment is undertaken by engaging representatives of the business lines with the assessment process who, together 
with specialists from the AFC & AFBC function, will work to assess the inherent risks to which DWS is currently and can in the 
future become exposed. The assessment uses existing risk data, i.e. external and internal fraud loss or bribery and corruption risk 
data managed and maintained centrally and aligned to existing controls, together with a pre-determined set of questions to 
determine any increase or decrease in the level of risks.  Residuals risks, i.e. new or existing risks identified through the annual 
RTA process as having no controls in place to manage them, are then identified and steps are taken to either enhance existing 
controls, or put in place new controls. 
DWS is subject to the global legal and regulatory requirements, as for any financial services industry business, with the added 
application from a local in-country perspective, of any more stringent laws and regulations. The risk associated with Fraud and 
64 
 
 
DWS   7  –  Risk Management, Compliance and Control   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
Bribery & Corruption, can be broken down into two sub-sets and potentially give rise to other inter alia Compliance risks such 
perceptions of impropriety and conflicts of interest. 
As with the wider Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Sanctions and Embargoes (S&E) and Know Your Client (KYC) Teams across 
the DWS AFC functions, the AFBC function has embarked on a programme of targeted education and awareness, coupled with 
regular ongoing assessments of Fraud risks and a programme of monitoring and assessing reported incidents and losses across 
the business units.  
Linked to this programme of activity, DWS requires all employees to conduct themselves with the highest standards of integrity at 
all times and to follow the correct procedures if they believe that something is not right. 
A Speak Up policy and culture is essential to maintaining a positive compliance culture in which everyone not only adheres to 
DWS policies, but also respects applicable laws and regulations in all jurisdictions at the same time as offering a safe 
environment for employees to raise issues. Issues can include, for example, ethical dilemmas in our daily work, such as 
weaknesses in processes or controls as well as reporting any concerns or suspicions regarding possible violations of laws, rules 
and regulations applicable to our business, including against retaliation.  
Staff members must not retaliate (in any form including amongst other things, demotion, dismissal, discharge, suspension or 
harassment) against any other staff member who makes a report internally in line with this policy or externally to any regulatory, 
investigatory of other agency or authority charged with receiving and investigating such reports from DWS staff. 
Across the 2019 DWS People survey, employees reported that compared to the previous year they felt equipped to report 
unethical behaviour, more comfortable with speaking up and by DWS communicating more openly, better able to manage risk 
without compromising company policies.  
During 2019, once again DWS did not identify or report any material breaches of regulatory requirements in relation to Fraud or 
Bribery & Corruption. 
Bribery and corruption which can give rise to the wider associated compliance risks, can arise from the giving and receiving of 
gifts and entertainment between employees and clients and customers of DWS, the hiring of employee candidates or the 
temporary or longer term placement of individuals who are politically exposed or may be related to politically exposed persons. 
Additionally, DWS must manage the risks associated with service providers and consultants utilised and paid by DWS to provide 
bespoke services. These are referred to as Business Development Consultants (BDC’s).  
BDC’s are specific entities or individuals used to perform services for and on behalf of the DWS business. The bespoke services 
they provide focus on using their respective industry specialists to find and introduce business opportunities to DWS. Each of the 
5 regions of DWS can engage a BDC, but in doing so, must first conduct an assessment of the risks a BDC may pose to DWS 
and seek advice and guidance and expert input from the AFBC function. The business working closely with AFBC, will seek to 
identify any reputational and/or others risks which the individual or entity may pose or already be exposed to. Prior to any on-
boarding, the relevant business team must also seek on-boarding clearance from DWS Board and at a senior AFC level.   
DWS currently has a limited population of six such BDC relationships, which are managed on an ongoing basis closely between 
the business line relationship owners and the AFBC team. BDC’s are categorised by reference to a number of risk factors 
including the country in which they are based and operate from, the services they provide, their business structure, i.e. 
Government or State Owned as well as any connection they might have to Politically Exposed Persons (PEP’s) or Public 
Officials. The risk category attributed to the BDC, determines the frequency also of periodic reviews undertaken on the BDC to 
assess if any attributes associated with the BDC have changed or they have become exposed to greater risks. Periodic reviews 
are conducted on a periodic scale of at least annually in the case of high risk BDC’s or when a ‘trigger’ event occurs and 
becomes known to DWS, training on DWS policies and procedural requirements and relevant risks which impact the BDC, is also 
provided by the Compliance / AFC specialists to the BDC’s themselves. 
DB Group has been engaged in discussions across late 2019 with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) regarding pre-2019 legacy 
matters relating to the on-boarding, use and monitoring of BDCs. The matter under discussion includes aspects of DWS’s 
involvement. It is expected that the matter will be concluded in early 2020 and any legal notices will be published thereafter.

7.5  Data Protection and Client Privacy 
[GRI 418-1] 
The adoption of new technologies, including robotics, public cloud, blockchain and big data analytics solutions combined with the 
proliferation of Financial Technology (FinTech) providers are providing a new wave of innovation for the financial services 
industry. While these new technologies are also bringing opportunities to asset managers they are also creating new risks. 
Historically, the asset management market has not been the primary focus for cyber-attacks due to the business nature and the 
focus of fraudsters on payments. These trends might be changing to more client data and intellectual property (e.g. investment 
strategies) driven targets, where asset managers could be a potential area for cyber-criminal activities. 
In terms of market monitoring and collaboration, we work with regulators and market participants to remain up-to-date in the 
newest information security developments and intelligence sharing with the support of a central service provided by the DB Group 
Chief Security Officer (CSO). As proactively sharing relevant indicators of compromise and further intelligence reduces the risk for 
all involved parties, we also collaborate closely with government authorities, and peer organisations. Our goal is to protect client 
data and prevent any material data leakage that would affect our clients during the use of our services. 
7.5.1  Data Privacy and Protection 
Data protection has remained a core focus for DWS with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in force from May 
25, 2018. Additionally, in 2019 we ensured that DWS would remain GDPR compliant if the outcome of the Brexit negotiations led 
to a no deal Brexit scenario. If there was a no deal scenario, the UK would be deemed a third country in terms of data protection. 
The right to freely transfer and receive data as a third country requires either adequacy status or additional data protection 
measures in place such as EU model clauses inserted into contracts. The EU Model Clauses are standardised contractual 
clauses used in agreements between service providers and their customers to ensure that any personal data leaving the EU/EEA 
will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection law and meet the requirements of the EU Data Protection Directive 
95/46/EC. To mitigate the impact of third country status, as an adequate status would not be granted initially, DWS reviewed all 
contracts with an EU to UK nexus and updated these contracts to include the EU model clauses. The UK indicated that there 
would be no change to receiving data from the EU.   
Governance 
For data privacy we are leveraging the DB Group expertise and resources. The DB Group General Data Protection (GDP) 
department is a specialised and independent function controlling the collection, processing and use of personal data. The GDP 
team sends reports directly to our Executive Board and is supported by local Data Protection Officers in the countries we conduct 
business in. This set-up ensures direct and indirect reporting lines as well as regular exchanges on data protection topics within 
our centralised and decentralised organisation. In response to the increased controls required to ensure compliance with GDPR 
provisions, GDP is being expanded to ensure we have enough personnel to monitor, test, and assess our data privacy and 
protection set-up. 
Education and Training on GPDR  
All our staff have been trained on the implications of GDPR for our day-to-day business. In 2019, for DWS employees in the EU 
there were no red flags for non-performing the specific GDPR training module. Various reporting and escalation processes from 
the business to GDP have been implemented to ensure that potential data breaches can be assessed and handled in a timely 
manner. This approach has also been outlined in a global data protection procedure that has been rolled out as part of the GDPR 
program. 
No data breaches of systemic relevance were observed in 2019. 
7.5.2  Information Security Governance 
Our COO is the DWS Executive Board member overseeing Information Security and has delegated the program execution to the 
DWS Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Our CISO is the senior accountable officer for information security who has been 
empowered to strengthen the cyber security protection and align to the strategic direction set by the CSO from Deutsche Bank in 
accordance with our risk appetite.  
As our most senior authority for security matters, our CISO develops and drives the implementation and operationalisation of the 
security strategy and ensures that our assets are appropriately protected. The cyber security program executed by DWS follows a 
66 
 
 
DWS   7  –  Risk Management, Compliance and Control   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
proactive risk-based approach continuously improving the control standards to accommodate the changes in the ‘threat 
landscape’, the evolution of the business model and the adoption of innovative technology and process solutions. To support this, 
DWS aligns its information security management system to the latest information security policies defined by DB Group. Our 
Information Security Framework is managed under the DB Group umbrella framework that has been validated by the certification 
ISO 27001, which was recertified in 2018 (valid until 2021). To address the risk of violation of the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of DWS information by third party vendors, DWS has a multi-layer vendor management program. This is governed by 
Third Party Risk Management principles on DB Group level and in 2018 DWS appointed a dedicated Head of Vendor 
Management. 
7.5.3  Employee Awareness and Training in Information Security 
All our employees are trained in information security risk and controls as part of their onboarding and regularly during their 
employment. The mandatory training includes several threat scenarios for which employees are challenged to select the best 
course of action to ensure that information is protected. Training sessions are continuously renewed, tailored and adapted to 
follow latest market developments and specific job profiles to ensure that employees are prepared in case of a cyber-threat.  
In addition to the mandatory training, we use the DB Group awareness campaigns following the strategy to fortify the human 
firewall. As in the previous year, we continued to roll out the multi-channel awareness campaign to all our staff globally, covering 
a broad range of information and security topics including the 2019 Information Security Month initiative. In 2019, we also 
continued the "Time to be aware - the target is you" campaign to help our staff understand common yet significant security threats 
and their responsibility and contribution to helping DWS protect itself against such threats.  
As a result of the strategy, in 2019 we have not experienced any relevant data leakages. 
7.6  Public Policy and Regulation 
Regulatory reforms in the EU and internationally expose us and our clients to increasing regulatory burdens. Failure to comply 
with laws and regulations applicable to us could result in harm to our reputation, regulatory penalties or fines and a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations. To be compliant with all relevant rules and regulations is of paramount importance for 
DWS. Our aim is to identify new regulations and changes to existing ones at an early stage and to inform the relevant parties 
within DWS about it. This ensures that necessary changes can be implemented in time, to amend, upgrade or introduce new 
policies, procedures, systems and controls as required. 
We obtain contractually agreed services from the DB Group regarding information on relevant changes in laws, regulations and 
circulars or in regulatory guidelines. As the risk of changing rules and regulations is inherent to our daily business, we have 
developed a holistic framework to identify and implement new or changed regulations using a systematic approach that prioritises 
significant regulatory risks to DB Group and allocates clear accountability for the identification, impact assessment and 
implementation of regulatory changes in order to address this adequately. 
The framework governs how we manage regulatory change risk and helps to build our profile in regulatory interaction in general, 
so that we engage constructively with regulatory stakeholders. It also ensures informed strategic decision-making and provides 
oversight and control over how key initiatives are implemented, as well as insight for senior management on upcoming issues of 
public policy.  
In 2019, DWS Compliance together with, amongst others, Change Management (under leadership of the Divisional Control 
Officer) and AFC developed an enhanced process including a Regulatory Change Forum to combine the information update 
process out of the different Control Functions to the DWS organisation holistically. This includes enhanced transparency 
regarding implementation and project monitoring.  
The strategy for the implementation of regulatory change projects depends on the impact of the specific regulatory changes and 
the regulation in question. For major regulatory change topics such as IBOR-Transition or SFTR Reporting centrally led DWS 
change management implementation teams are established to determine precise impact per business lines.  
DWS Compliance hold monthly Regulatory Compliance Global Forum calls, in which Regulatory Compliance contacts from 
respective regions can educate colleagues on key items which impact their jurisdictions and which may have extra-territorial 
impact. The amended process is aimed to ensure informed strategic decision-making and to provide oversight and control over 
how regulations are implemented.

7.7  Marketing and Labelling 
Our reputation is founded on trust from our employees, clients, shareholders, regulators and from the public in general. Isolated 
events can undermine that trust and negatively impact our reputation and hence our brand and it is therefore of the utmost 
importance that it is protected.  
Our governance structure including clear and transparent operation guidelines, defined policies and our corporate values provide 
a structured framework for all employees to protect our brand and reputation. They enable a tight connectivity across the 
organisation to ensure that the framework is being followed and fully implemented. Our values and methodical business process 
are also reflected in the marketing and labelling of our products.  
All marketing efforts must be tailored to the investors requirements, must be fair, balanced and designed to ensure that risks are 
reasonably disclosed. Such materials are subject to complex regulatory requirements, which vary depending on the DWS entity, 
product, intended audience, venue where the offer or sale occurs, and other criteria. Our employees use professional judgment to 
present product and marketing content with honesty and transparency. 
As part of the marketing review process all marketing, product materials and further documents are reviewed and approved by 
compliance or respective business gatekeepers to ensure that guidelines are being followed. The records of all approved material 
are either retained by compliance and/or the business or within the compliance review systems. Only material that has been 
reviewed and approved can be published or distributed externally to clients. 
We follow a clear set of rules including the DB Group-wide Code of Conduct and address law-abiding conduct, corruption 
prevention, conflicts of interest, information and data protection to protect our clients’ interests as well as our brand and 
reputation. We also follow the standards of Deutsche Bank’s Gifts, Entertainment and Business Event Policy, our global 
Marketing Material Policy and for some regions additional marketing policies that have been defined based on local requirements. 
7.8  Audit 
DWS Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and 
efficiency of the risk management systems and systems of internal controls. DWS Internal Audit also acts as an independent, 
proactive and forward-looking challenger and adviser to Senior Management of the Group. In addition to the members of the 
Executive Board, DWS Internal Audit has been granted the authority to communicate with the Chairperson of the Supervisory 
Board and the Supervisory Board Audit & Risk Committee of DWS. 
DWS Internal Audit’s activities are based on a comprehensive, risk-based audit plan. The audit plan covers DWS’ activities and 
processes, irrespective of whether they are outsourced or not, in a risk-oriented manner as a general rule within three years. The 
three-year audit cycle may not be extended to more than five years. 
DWS Internal Audit prepares written reports on each audit and submits them to the responsible Senior Management in DWS. The 
reports include the audit subject, results evaluation, findings and remedial actions or recommendations for the findings.

8.1  Independent Auditor’s Limited Assurance Report 48 
[GRI – 102-54] 
To the Supervisory Board of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, Frankfurt am Main 
We have performed an independent limited assurance engagement on the separate non- financial group report according to 
§§ 315b, 315c in connection with 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (further „non-financial group report”) of 
DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, Frankfurt am Main (further „DWS“ or “Company”) for the period from January 1 to December 31, 
2019. 
Management’s Responsibility 
The legal representatives of the company are responsible for the preparation of the non-financial group report in accordance with 
§§ 315b, 315c in connection with 289c to 289e HGB. 
This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the non-
financial group report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given 
circumstances. 
Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the 
preparation of the non-financial group report in a way that is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements. 
Independence and quality assurance on the part of the auditing firm 
We are independent from the company in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set out in 
legal provisions and professional pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance with 
these requirements. 
Our audit firm applies the legal provisions and professional pronouncements for quality assurance, in particular the Professional 
Code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German 
Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW 
QS 1). 
Practitioner’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed on the separate non-financial group report within a 
limited assurance engagement. 
We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” published by IAASB. This standard 
requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our 
attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial group report for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, 
was not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB. We do 
not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering 
procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a 
reasonable assurance engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. 
Within the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures: 
−  Inquiries of personnel at group level who are responsible for the materiality analysis in order to gain an understanding of 
the processes for determining material sustainability topics and respective reporting boundaries of DWS 
                                                           
48  Our engagement applied to the German version of the separate non-financial group report 2019. This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German, whereas 
the German text is authoritative.

DWS   8  – Supplementary Information   
Sustainability Report 2019   
   
     
−  A risk analysis, including a media research, to identify relevant information on DWS sustainability performance in the 
reporting period 
−  Evaluation of the design and implementation of systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of 
disclosures on environmental, employee and social matters, respect for human rights, and combating corruption and 
bribery as well as on further voluntarily reported matters, including data consolidation 
−  Inquiries of personnel on group level who are responsible for determining disclosures on concepts, due diligence 
processes, results and risks, the conduction of internal controls and consolidation of the disclosures 
−  Evaluation of selected internal and external documents 
−  An analytical review of the reported data and trend explanations submitted by all sites for consolidation at group level. 
−  Evaluating the overall presentation of the disclosures, included in the scope of this engagement. 
Conclusion 
Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the separate non-financial group report of DWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2019 is 
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
