The global food system: 
 Identifying sustainable solutions
 
Thought leadership from Credit Suisse and the world’s foremost experts
Introduction 
In my new role as Chairman of Credit Suisse, 
I am delighted to introduce the first study from 
the Credit Suisse Research Institute under my 
tenure, with its accent firmly on sustainability.
Sustainability is, rightly so, a key component 
of Credit Suisse’s strategy and culture, which 
importantly shapes solutions we provide for our 
clients. 
 
“Investing with purpose” is the underlying 
theme of our recently published investment 
Supertrends. Aligned with such thinking, the 
Credit Suisse Research Institute has been 
tackling topics such as energy transition and 
the consequences of growing water scarcity 
in its recent studies. This report now throws a 
spotlight on the global food system.
I hope you find our insights in this study valuable 
and wish you a stimulating read.

The food system  
impacts all SDGs
The relevance of a sustainable food system to the UN Sustainable Development Goals
Source: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
The global food system covers all activities related to food production and consumption from “farm to fork.” A sustainable 
food system is highly relevant in relation to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as introduced by the United Nations in 
2015. In fact, we agree with analysis done by the UN that all of its 17 SDGs benefit from a more sustainable food system. 
To put it another way, meeting the 2030 targets associated with the SDGs appears highly unlikely in our view unless action 
is taken to make the global food system more sustainable.

The double burden  
of malnutrition 
A sustainable global food system benefits human health as well as the 
global ecosystem. However, this is far from the reality at present as 
almost 700 million people are undernourished, while at the same time 
around 1.8 billion people globally are overweight or obese. The need to 
change appears obvious to us as the impact of malnutrition alone costs 
the global economy USD 13.6 trillion annually.

In addition to a lack of access to food, we 
find that consumers across lesser-developed 
countries and regions face additional challenges.

Poverty and lack of education matter too
Poverty and lack of education are two of the 
root causes of malnutrition even in wealthy 
and developed nations. Studies have shown 
that obesity and food insecurity often go hand 
in hand. In the United States, for instance, 
some 10.5% of all households were food 
insecure in 2019, having insufficient money 
or other resources for food. In that year,

We estimate that overweight costs the global 
community USD 4.8 trillion each year, with the 
highest percentage of losses recorded in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (–4.8%) and North 
America (–4.3%, Figure 16). On a country 
level and in absolute terms, the highest losses 
due to overweight are documented in the 
United States (USD 922 billion), followed by 
China, India and Brazil.
Moreover, malnutrition in all its forms may 
result in extra emissions of approximately 
1,762 megatons of CO2 equivalents per year 
globally. Putting a price tag on these extra 
CO2 emissions of USD 186.8 per ton of CO2 
equivalents results in additional yearly costs of 
USD 329.1 billion between 2020 and 2035 (in 
2010 US dollars).

The environmental impact  
of food
Malnutrition is not the only reason why the global food system needs to 
change. Food production and consumption already contribute well over 
20% to global greenhouse gas emissions and account for more than 90% 
of the world’s freshwater consumption. After reviewing the environmental 
footprint of all major food groups, we conclude that the current situation 
is likely to worsen significantly unless action is taken. The likely growth in 
the world’s population to around ten billion people by 2050 coupled with 
a further shift in diets, especially across the growing emerging middle 
class, could increase emissions by a further 46%, while demand for 
agricultural land could increase by 49%.

Food loss and waste
In the previous chapters, we outlined the challenges of the current global 
food system due to the associated malnutrition and environmental 
footprint. These challenges are made worse by the fact that more than 
30% of food produced is either lost or wasted. By way of example, around 
USD 408 billion of food produced in 2019 went unsold or uneaten. The 
FAO estimates the economic, environmental and social costs associated 
with food waste at USD 2.6 trillion. Eliminating food waste in the United 
States and Europe alone would add 10% to the world’s available food 
supply. Solutions need to focus across the entire supply chain as about 
50% of food is lost in the production and handling phase, while 45% is 
wasted in the distribution and consumption phase.

In 2008, a study carried out by the European 
Commission estimated that up to 10% of the 
food waste generated in the EU is linked to date 
marking. Misinterpretation of the meaning of the 
dates, such as “best before” or “use by” can lead 
to food loss and waste. The “best before” date 
as opposed to “use by” is an indication of quality 
more than safety. As part of its waste-prevention 
efforts, the EU Platform on Food Losses and 
Food Waste makes the case for improved date-
marking practices and guidance to both food 
business operators and consumers.

A change in diet
A change toward a plant-based diet appears inevitable, in our view, 
if the global food system is to become more sustainable. Research 
suggests that a plant-based diet not only has around a 90% lower 
emission intensity than the current average diet, but also has the 
potential to reduce the number of premature deaths among adults 
by around 11 million. We see strong growth potential for alternative 
animal-protein products and estimate that the value of the market for 
alternative meat and dairy can grow to USD 1.4 trillion by 2050. Despite 
the involvement of more than 600 mainly small and private companies 
in this field, we expect the traditional food companies to continue to 
transition their operations toward healthier products.

Smart agriculture
The combination of continued population growth, rising spending 
power and declining arable land per capita suggests that a shift in diet 
alone may not be enough to make the food system more sustainable. 
Further productivity improvements across the food supply chain and 
in both developed and emerging economies can be achieved by large-
scale adoption of new technologies. For example, vertical farming could 
provide 80% of food demand in urban areas. Precision farming through 
the use of artificial intelligence, drones, autonomous machinery and 
smart irrigation systems could yield productivity increases of 70% by 
2050. All in all, the market for connected agricultural products and 
services could add USD 500 billion to global GDP by 2030.

crops in the air with visible roots that can be 
sprayed with a nutrient-filled water solution to 
enable growth. According to vertical farming 
leader, AeroFarms, this method uses 95% 
less water than traditional farming and is 390 
times more productive per square foot than 
traditional open fields.

Solutions: Circular economy, 
packaging and cooling
Reducing the more than 30% of food that is either lost or wasted would 
significantly aid the quest for a more sustainable food system. Donating 
or sharing food would be an obvious and very effective way to address 
food waste. Circular-based solutions such as those that use food waste 
to create new (food) products also help. Smart packaging solutions 
are being developed that not only help improve production yields but 
importantly help reduce food loss and waste across the entire supply 
chain from the farm to the home. The development and introduction of 
cooling and storage solutions would help extend the lifespan of food  
even more.

Table 1: Examples of companies using food waste as ingredients for new food or beverage products
Company Name Solutions
Regrained When grain is made into beer, the brewing process takes out sugar – leaving behind protein, fiber, and micronutrients that 
Regrained makes into a flour it calls “SuperGrain+” and incorporates into snack bars. The company also sells the flour to 
other manufacturers and is working on another line of products.
Render Bay Area-based Render partners with chefs to create new products like Weyla, a beverage that blends whey from a 
Sonoma creamery with fruit, herbs and botanicals, and Bryner, a savory drink mix made with upcycled pickle brine that can 
be used in making a Bloody Mary. In collaboration with chefs from San Francisco’s State Bird Provisions, it recreated a 
snack that the chefs make for themselves in the restaurant kitchen to make use of leftover quinoa.
Coffee Cherry Company When a former Starbucks engineer learned about the challenge of coffee cherry waste – tiny fruits that hold coffee beans 
and usually end up rotting on coffee plantations – he created a new process that converts the fruits into flour and launched 
a start-up (formerly known as CoffeeFlour) to produce it. The ingredient, which can be added to drinks, baked goods and 
other products, also helps coffee farmers increase incomes.
The Real Dill This Denver-based pickle company did not want to throw out the cucumber-infused water that it creates as part of the 
pickling process, so it started making it into a Bloody Mary mix. Now the company says it is better known for the mix than 
for pickles, and the product has helped it achieve a goal of zero waste.
Planetarians When sunflower seeds are processed for their oil, the end-result is a hard dry wood-like “oilcake” that is usually used as 
animal feed. But the ingredient has more protein than meat, and the founders of this start-up realized that it had potential 
as a food for humans. They found a way to process the oilcake with steam, heat and pressure to puff it up and turn the 
ingredient into chips.
Sallt & Straw Salt & Straw, a chain of West Coast ice-cream shops, made a “Second-Steeped Rum Spices and Apple Butter” flavor in 
2017 from spices rescued from a Portland distillery and apple butter made from bruised apples that otherwise would have 
been wasted. 
Sir Kensington's The vegan mayo made by Sir Kensington’s replaces eggs with aquafaba, the liquid made from cooking chickpeas – 
something that it sources from a hummus manufacturer that otherwise would have been thrown out. The brand was 
acquired by Unilever in 2017.
Baldor Baldor, a major food processor that makes products like “baby” carrots (i.e. regular carrots carved into tiny pieces), turns 
fruit and vegetable scraps into multiple products: some fruit scraps go to juice companies, vegetable scraps go to chefs for 
use in stocks, a mix of vegetables are dried and crushed into a flour that can be used in place of wheat, and other scraps 
are used in meal kits that include veggie noodles.
Toast Ale If the spent grain from brewing can be used to make bread – something that the Chicago-area Hewn Bakery does in one 
of its loaves – bread can also be used to make beer. Toast Ale, which first launched in London, makes a pale ale with 
surplus bread as an ingredient. The company estimates that around 44% of bread is wasted and that it can save roughly 
one slice of bread per bottle.
Fopo This European company rescues fruit and vegetables that are on the verge of being wasted, freeze-dries them, and turns 
them into a powder that contains most of the nutrition of the original fruit, but can last as long as two years.
Real Good Stuff Co. A Chicago-based cold-pressed juice company turns its extra juice pulp into fruit-and-vegetable-filled popsicles. One 
combines apples, lemons, cucumbers and spinach; another makes use of extra beets, ginger and carrots. The company 
also uses leftover pulp to make dog treats.
Rise Products Using spent grain from breweries in Brooklyn and Queens, this start-up creates a barley “super flour” that has twice as 
much protein, 12 times as much fiber, and one-third of the carbs of regular flour. It sells the flour directly to consumers, 
along with a brownie mix and brownies. Its underlying technology can also be applied to other by-products ranging from 
fruit skins to coffee waste.
White Moustache Making yogurt results in large quantities of whey, a liquid that is often discarded. Brooklyn-based yogurt company White 
Moustache decided to start marketing it as a “probiotic tonic.” The company also uses surplus fruit along with whey in 
frozen yogurt probiotic pops.
Treasure8 Based on Treasure Island, a small artificial island in the San Francisco Bay, this start-up designed technology that 
dehydrates fruits and vegetables to turn them into nutritious, shelf-stable chips that do not require preservatives. The 
company sources produce that would otherwise be wasted from food-processing plants.
Rubies in the Rubble This UK-based company makes condiments from surplus food, such as a spicy tomato relish that uses tomatoes that are 
too ripe or flawed to be sold in the produce section, or a pear chutney made with imperfect pears.

Solutions: Regulation

Our analysis shows that current food consumption patterns not only 
have serious health implications, but that they also put the ecological 
sustainability of our planet at risk and carry substantial economic costs. 
These challenges are only likely to become greater when we incorporate 
the likely increase in the world’s population for the next few decades. In 
our view, all of this suggests a change toward a more sustainable food 
system is essential, although we see a number of roadblocks that will 
need to be overcome.

Appendix 1:  Assessing the 
economic costs of malnutrition
Our estimation of the global economic costs of malnutrition builds on 
available sources on the topic and merges them into a continuum. 
This includes bridging some gaps through additional assumptions and 
widening the scope to a larger number of countries. We express our 
estimates as an average yearly cost over the period 2020–35 in 2010 US 
dollars based on purchasing power parity (PPP).
