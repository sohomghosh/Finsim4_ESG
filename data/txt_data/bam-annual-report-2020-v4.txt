Brookfield at a Glance
We	are	a	leading	global	alternative	asset	manager	with	$600	billion	of	assets	under	management,	and	a	focus	on	
investing	in	long-life,	high-quality	assets	and	businesses	that	help	form	the	backbone	of	the	global	economy.	Our	
goal	is	to	enable	the	companies	and	assets	we	invest	in,	as	well	as	the	communities	in	which	we	operate,	to	thrive	
over the long term.
We	serve	a	broad	range	of	institutional	investors,	sovereign	wealth	funds	and	individuals	around	the	world.	As	
stewards	of	the	capital	our	investors	entrust	to	us,	we	leverage	our	experience	and	deep	operating	expertise	to	
create	long-term	value	on	their	behalf,	helping	them	meet	their	goals	and	protect	their	financial	futures.
Our	capital	structure	is	built	to	allow	us	to	finance	investments	by	drawing	from	various	sources—including	our	
own	balance	sheet,	our	publicly	listed	affiliates’	capital	and	capital	from	our	institutional	investors.	This	access	to	
flexible,	large-scale	capital	allows	us	to	pursue	transactions	for	our	investors	that	are	significant	in	size,	generate	
attractive	financial	returns	and	cash	flows,	and	support	the	growth	of	our	asset	management	activities.	
Importantly,	it	also	means	that	our	capital	is	invested	alongside	that	of	our	investors,	ensuring	that	our	interests	
are always aligned with theirs.
At	Brookfield,	sound	Environmental,	Social	and	Governance	(ESG)	practices	are	integral	to	building	resilient	
businesses	and	creating	long-term	value	for	our	investors	and	stakeholders.	These	practices	are	routed	in	our	
philosophy	of	conducting	business	with	a	long-term	perspective	in	a	sustainable	and	ethical	manner.	This	means	
operating	with	robust	governance	and	other	ESG	principles	and	practices,	and	maintaining	a	disciplined	focus	on	
embedding	these	principles	into	all	our	activities.
Our	people	remain	the	most	important	element	of	our	business,	and	our	culture	is	based	on	integrity,	collaboration	
and	discipline.	We	place	a	strong	emphasis	on	diversity	across	all	our	businesses,	because	we	recognize	that	our	
success	depends	on	fostering	a	wide	range	of	perspectives,	experiences	and	world	views.
•  Investment focus: We	focus	on	real	estate,	infrastructure,	renewable	power,	private	equity	and	credit.
•  Diverse product offering: We	offer	core,	core-plus,	value-add,	opportunistic/growth	equity	and	credit	
strategies	through	closed-end	and	perpetual	vehicles	in	both	the	public	and	private	markets.
•  Focused investment strategies: We	invest	where	we	can	bring	our	competitive	advantages	to	bear,	
leveraging	our	global	reach,	access	to	large-scale	capital	and	operational	expertise.
•  Disciplined financing approach: We	take	a	conservative	approach	to	the	use	of	leverage,	ensuring	we	can	
preserve	capital	across	all	business	cycles.
•  Sustainability: We	are	committed	to	ensuring	that	the	assets	and	businesses	we	invest	in	are	set	up	for	
long-term	success,	and	we	seek	to	have	a	positive	impact	on	the	environment	and	the	communities	in	which	
we operate.

Investment Principles
Our	approach	to	investing	is	disciplined	and	proven—reflecting	our	more	than	100-year	history	as	an	owner-
operator.	We	focus	on	value	creation	and	capital	preservation,	investing	opportunistically	in	high-quality	assets	
and	businesses	within	our	areas	of	expertise,	managing	them	proactively	and	financing	them	conservatively—
with	the	goal	of	generating	stable,	predictable	and	growing	cash	flows	for	all	our	investors.	We	recognize	that	
generating	attractive	risk-adjusted	returns	often	requires	taking	a	contrarian	approach	to	evaluating	assets,	
businesses,	markets	or	sectors.	
Our	business	is	anchored	by	a	set	of	core	investment	principles	that	guide	our	decision-making	and	determine	
how we measure success:
BUSINESS   •  Operate our business and conduct our relationships with integrity
PHILOSOPHY
•  Attract and retain high-caliber individuals who will grow with us over 
the long term
•  Ensure our people think and act like owners in all their decisions
•  Treat our investor and shareholder money like it’s our own
•  Embed strong ESG principles throughout our operations to help us 
ensure that our business model is sustainable
INVESTMENT  •  Acquire high-quality assets and businesses
APPROACH
•  Invest on a value basis, with the goal of maximizing return on capital
•  Enhance the value of investments through our operating expertise
•  Build sustainable cash flows to provide certainty, reduce risk and 
lower our cost of capital
MEASURES FOR  •  Evaluate total return on capital over the long term
SUCCESS
•  Encourage calculated risks, but compare returns with risk
•  Sacrifice short-term profit, if necessary, to achieve long-term capital 
appreciation
•  Seek profitability rather than growth, as size does not necessarily add 
value
5 BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Letter to Shareholders
OVERVIEW (AS OF FEBRUARY 11TH, 2021)
We	ended	the	year	with	the	best	quarter	on	record.	Given	the	environment	and	the	extraordinary	year,	that	says	
a	lot	for	our	business.	Despite	the	turmoil	and	disruption,	our	investment	strategies	and	the	strength	of	our	
capital	structure	showed	through.	Results	in	our	asset	management	business	were	very	strong,	with	FFO	up	close	
to	20%	over	the	previous	year.	Total	FFO	for	the	year	of	$5.2	billion	was	also	a	record,	with	realizations	in	the	
fourth	quarter	adding	to	results.	On	a	go-forward	basis,	annualized	asset	management	revenues	including	carry	
are	now	running	at	$6.5	billion,	and	with	our	next	round	of	fundraising	for	our	private	flagship	funds	just	
beginning,	the	franchise	is	poised	for	growth.	
We	have	also	launched	four	new	strategies,	and	while	none	of	these	are	expected	to	be	significant	contributors	
to	our	results	in	the	short	term,	they	should	all	be	meaningful	in	the	longer	term.	These	include	investing	in	LP	
secondaries,	the	energy	transition	to	net-zero	carbon,	technology	and	reinsurance.	
With	respect	to	reinsurance,	as	recently	announced,	we	plan	to	distribute	to	you	a	new	share	of	Brookfield	
Reinsurance	as	a	special	dividend.	This	share	will	be	paired	with	BAM	shares	to	enable	us	to	efficiently	operate	
this	business,	and	it	should	be	attractive	to	some	of	you	to	hold.	
Post	year	end,	we	launched	a	tender	offer	to	take	our	property	company	private.	We	did	this	as	most	property	
securities	trade	poorly	in	the	market,	despite	the	underlying	real	estate	being	valuable.	Taking	it	private	will	offer	
us	greater	flexibility	in	managing	assets,	and	by	paying	our	co-owners	of	BPY	an	attractive	price,	which	they	can	
elect	to	receive	in	a	combination	of	cash,	preferred	shares	with	a	coupon	commensurate	with	current	yields,	or	
BAM	shares	for	continued	upside	in	the	stock	market,	we	believe	it	is	best	for	all	concerned.	
BAM STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE WAS GOOD, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
As	an	indication	of	returns	that	can	be	generated	for	investors,	below	is	our	latest	tabulation	of	annualized	
compound	investment	returns	over	the	past	30	years.	For	reference,	$1,000	invested	30	years	ago	in	Brookfield	
Asset	Management	is	today	worth	$86,000.	Some	years	have	been	fantastic,	some	were	like	2020;	but	as	
demonstrated	in	this	table,	compounding	reasonable	returns	over	long	periods	of	time	is	an	incredible	miracle	
of	finance.
Compound Investment Performance
$1,000 Invested  10-Year U.S. 
Years in Brookfield Brookfield NYSE S&P 500 Treasuries
1  $	 1,090 9% 18% 10%
5 $	 2,200 17% 15% 5%
10 $	 3,400 13% 14% 5%
20 $	 32,500 19% 8% 5%
30 $	 86,000 16% 11% 4%
The	returns	earned	by	a	company	are	the	reflection	of	many	factors,	but	over	the	longer	term	they	are	the	result	
of	the	combination	of	a	good	strategic	plan	and	relentless	execution	of	that	plan.	Only	in	the	longer	term	is	it	
possible	to	look	back	at	both	strategy	and	execution,	which	if	done	well,	tends	to	also	compound	over	time.	
Furthermore,	we	believe	the	intrinsic	value	of	a	Brookfield	share	today	is	greater	than	the	share	price;	this	gives	
us	a	large	margin	of	safety	in	our	efforts	to	record	reasonable	returns	over	the	longer	term.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT 6
THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT WAS UNFORGETTABLE
Much	has	been	said	about	2020,	and	it	surely	was	one	of	the	most	unusual	years	in	memory.	GDP	in	every	
country	dropped	precipitously,	stock	markets	plummeted	then	recovered,	central	banks	collapsed	interest	rates	
to	zero,	and	money	with	little	risk	became	virtually	free.	Many	businesses	were	shut	down,	most	worked	from	
home,	people	were	afraid,	plane	travel	declined	98%,	Brexit	happened,	and	a	new	U.S.	president	was	elected.
As	the	year	turns	over	to	2021,	markets	are	strong,	borrowing	costs	are	low,	money	is	available	to	well	capitalized	
borrowers,	stock	price	multiples	for	many	businesses	are	extremely	high,	and	pharma	companies	have	come	
through	in	amazing	time	with	vaccines	that	are	now	being	distributed.	Our	expectation	is	that	economies	will	
regularize	as	the	at-risk	populations	are	vaccinated,	and	as	the	death	and	hospitalization	numbers	decline.	This	
is	starting	to	happen	now—albeit	unevenly—and	as	governments	and	people	get	comfortable	enough	to	resume	
a	more	normal	life,	we	expect	we	will	see	a	strong	recovery	in	economic	numbers	starting	now	and	into	2022.
With	no	meaningful	inflation	on	the	horizon	and	high	unemployment	numbers,	there	is	an	expectation	that	
interest	rates	will	stay	low	and	that	stocks	that	were	not	bolstered	by	the	pandemic	trade	will	recover.	Other	good	
companies	that	have	elevated	multiples	either	will	be	proven	to	deserve	them,	or	their	securities	may	trade	
sideways	for	a	time,	until	their	results	catch	up	with	their	share	prices.
Our	operations	are	highly	geared	to	the	economic	recovery.	As	a	result,	we	should	be	able	to	grow	the	value	of	
our	businesses	coming	out	of	this	recession	while	hopefully	narrowing	the	gap	between	the	intrinsic	value	and	
the	trading	price	of	a	Brookfield	share.	Like	most	businesses,	we	are	pleased	to	see	2020	behind	us,	and	we	look	
forward	to	2021/2022.
OUR BUSINESS WAS STRONG, DESPITE HEADWINDS
During	the	fourth	quarter,	we	generated	a	record	$2.1	billion	of	FFO,	an	increase	of	75%	over	the	same	period	in	
2019.	Full	year	FFO	was	$5.2	billion,	showcasing	the	resiliency	of	our	underlying	businesses.	This	is	even	more	
remarkable,	as	up	to	20%	of	our	businesses	were	shut	for	months	during	the	year	and	some	are	still	recovering.	
This	should	mean	that	as	the	global	recovery	takes	hold,	our	results	will	get	even	stronger.	All	of	this	led	to	record	
total	cash	available	to	shareholders	for	distribution	and/or	reinvestment	(CAFDR)	of	$3.1	billion	or	$2.01	per	
share in 2020.
AS AT AND FOR THE 12 MONTHS ENDED DEC. 31

Gross annual run rate of fees plus target carry 2,031 2,475 2,975 5,781 6,472 34%
Total assets under management 239,825 283,141 354,736 544,896 601,983 26%
Asset Management Performance was Good and is Getting Better 
Our asset management franchise had a strong year in 2020. We increased total assets under management to 
$600	billion	and	fee	bearing	capital	to	$312	billion.	Annualized	fee-related	earnings	and	target	carried	interest	are	
now	$6.5	billion	on	an	annualized	basis.
In	total,	we	raised	approximately	$42	billion	across	our	private	fund	strategies.	This	included	capital	for	some	of	
our	flagship	funds,	and	we	also	made	great	progress	in	raising	capital	for	our	perpetual	core	private	fund	
offerings.	
We	now	have	approximately	20	different	return	strategies	across	our	five	main	investment	verticals	that	span	
senior	debt	to	opportunistic	equity.	These	included	$13	billion	of	commitments	for	our	latest	distressed	debt	
fund	and	$9	billion	for	perpetual	core	strategies.	We	also	held	a	final	close	on	our	second	infrastructure	debt	fund	
of	$2.7	billion.
7 BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Despite	the	challenges	of	2020,	we	generated	approximately	$1.2	billion	of	carried	interest	during	the	year	and	
now	have	$4.7	billion	of	accrued	unrealized	carried	interest	on	capital	that	has	been	invested.	The	benefits	of	the	
focus	our	funds	have	on	critical	service	assets	with	contracted,	leased	or	regulated	cash	flows	were	also	highlighted	
in	2020,	with	valuations	holding,	and	in	some	cases	even	increasing	as	a	result	of	their	income	durability.	We	have	
re-initiated	asset	sales	that	had	been	delayed	earlier	in	2020,	and	demand	for	these	assets	has	been	strong.	We	
recently	announced	a	number	of	sales	that	we	expect	to	close	in	the	coming	months;	if	they	close	as	expected,	
2021	should	be	another	strong	year.	
At	our	Investor	Day,	we	laid	out	our	plans	for	the	next	round	of	flagship	fundraising,	with	a	target	of	$100	billion.	
Our	flagship	credit	fund	is	off	to	a	great	start.	We	recently	launched	both	our	fourth	flagship	real	estate	fund	and	
our	new	Global	Transition	Fund,	which	is	focused	on	decarbonizing	the	global	energy	grid.
Operations were Resilient 
Our	renewable	power	operations	continued	to	deliver	strong	results	in	2020,	supported	by	a	globally	diversified	
asset	base	and	long-dated,	take-or-pay	power	contracts.	During	the	year,	BEP	completed	the	privatization	of	
TerraForm	Power,	and	we	recently	announced	the	acquisition	of	a	distributed	generation	platform	in	the	U.S.	
Combined,	these	scale	operations	in	solar,	wind,	hydro,	storage	and	distributed	generation	position	us	well	to	
participate	in	the	decarbonization	of	the	world’s	energy	supply.
Our	infrastructure	businesses	were	extremely	durable	during	the	year.	With	95%	of	the	cash	flows	backed	by	
regulated	or	contracted	revenue	streams	stemming	from	critical	infrastructure	assets,	earnings	were	largely	
unimpacted	by	the	economic	shutdown.	We	continued	to	expand	our	investment	in	data,	which	is	in	a	multi-year	
growth	trend.	We	acquired	a	portfolio	of	137,000	communication	towers	in	India,	which	will	capitalize	on	the	
rollout	of	5G	and	other	future	technologies.	We	are	also	well	positioned	to	participate	in	the	global	infrastructure	
investment	and	privatizations	that	are	likely	to	follow	as	a	result	of	both	the	sizeable	debt	that	governments	have	
taken on in recent months and their need to stimulate their economies. 
Within	our	real	estate	business,	most	of	our	assets	performed	well	in	2020.	Our	office	portfolio	is	largely	backed	
by	long-dated	leases	to	high-quality	tenants,	and	rent	collection	was	only	marginally	impacted.	While	our	retail	
and	hospitality	assets	faced	challenges,	in	those	markets	where	governments	began	slowly	lifting	restrictions,	we	
have	seen	a	steady	rebound	in	performance.	Foot	traffic	and	sales	per	customer	have	increased	significantly	in	
our	U.S.	mall	portfolio,	and	forward	bookings	for	our	hospitality	assets	are	slowly	recovering.	During	the	year,	we	
closed	on	the	sale	of	a	London	office	property,	sold	our	U.S.	self-storage	business,	and	also	disposed	of	a	life	
sciences	office	portfolio—each	well	above	both	its	acquisition	cost	and	IFRS	value.	
Our	private	equity	operations	continued	to	grow,	and	we	made	a	number	of	acquisitions,	including	a	leading	non-
bank	financial	corporation	specialized	in	commercial	vehicle	lending	in	India,	and	an	Asia-based	technology	
services platform focused on customer management services. We also announced the privatization of Canada’s 
leading	mortgage	insurer,	and	the	merger	of	Norbord	into	West	Fraser.	We	now	own	approximately	20%	of	this	
combined	entity,	which	is	the	pre-eminent	forest	products	business	in	North	America.	
Our	credit	platform	delivered	strong	results	in	2021.	We	were	able	to	deploy	$22	billion	during	the	year,	capitalizing	
on	the	March/April	market	dislocation,	and	other	opportunities.	We	expect	further	opportunities	to	arise	as	
government	stimulus	rolls	off	and	companies	need	to	recapitalize.	The	final	close	of	our	distressed	debt	fund	is	
likely	to	take	place	in	the	first	half	of	this	year;	it	already	is	the	largest	distressed	debt	fund	we	have	raised.	
PRIVATIZING OUR PROPERTY BUSINESS
In	early	January,	we	announced	a	proposal	to	acquire	the	balance	of	BPY	that	we	do	not	already	own.	The	simple	
story	is	that	while	the	assets	are	exceptional	and	the	tangible	value	is	higher	than	the	share	price,	property	
securities	show	no	signs	of	trading	near	their	intrinsic	value.	As	a	result,	we	believe	our	BPY	partners	will	realize	
value	far	more	quickly	with	the	deal	we	are	offering	them.	
2020 ANNUAL REPORT 8
Over	the	years,	we	have	worked	hard	to	execute	our	property	business	plans,	with	great	success,	but	unfortunately	
the	public	markets	have	consistently	struggled	to	appropriately	value	its	assets.	This	is	not	unique	to	BPY;	many	
property	company	securities	have	struggled	to	trade	at	NAV	for	years.	In	fact,	we	have	taken	private	numerous	
real estate companies in our private funds for this very reason. 
It	has	been	evident	to	us	for	some	time	now	that	this	portfolio	and	our	approach	to	creating	value	are	not	well	
suited	to	the	current	public	markets.	To	be	clear,	our	view	of	the	value	of	the	portfolio	has	not	changed.	This	is	
simply	a	classic	example	of	assets	not	being	what	public	market	investors	currently	wish	to	invest	into.	
Privatizing	the	company	will	give	us	flexibility	to	realize	the	true	value	of	the	portfolio	in	the	longer	term	by	
redeveloping	some	assets,	constructing	new	ones,	selling	some	assets	outright,	and	using	various	assets	to	create	
or	grow	perpetual,	private,	core	real	estate	funds.	The	conviction	we	have	in	the	latter	has	been	enhanced	by	our	
recent	success	with	our	series	of	perpetual	private	real	estate	funds	that	we	now	have	in	North	America,	Europe	
and Australia. 
Although	the	immediate	impact	of	the	transaction	will	be	an	increase	to	the	size	of	our	balance	sheet,	this	will	
quickly	reverse,	and	we	expect	that	over	the	next	five	years	we	will	end	up	with	fewer	real	estate	assets	than	we	
have	today—because	of	this	transaction	and	the	flexibility	it	will	offer	us.	In	time,	we	will	also	re-create	the	fee	
streams	in	the	private	markets,	benefiting	our	clients	who	have	a	desire	to	own	this	highest	quality	real	estate.
THE NEXT BEGINNING HAS ALREADY BEGUN
We	are	onto	the	next	beginning	for	Brookfield.	With	all	our	funds	performing	well	during	last	year,	our	balance	
sheets	in	extremely	good	financial	shape,	and	our	alternative	investment	management	franchise	now	one	of	the	
pre-eminent	businesses	around	the	world,	we	are	onto	the	next	phase	of	growth	for	Brookfield.	We	have	widened	
the	moat	of	our	business	globally	and	continue	to	add	new	products	for	our	clients.	With	interest	rates	low,	
alternatives	are	the	investment	category	that	offers	an	attractive	return	for	our	clients,	and	we	are	innovating	to	
provide them with new products.
We	are	also	scaling	up	the	size	of	our	large	flagship	funds.	Their	size	differentiates	us	and	therefore	enhances	our	
returns.	In	addition,	our	clients	are	looking	for	income	replacement	with	less	volatility,	and	we	are	continuing	to	
add	perpetual	core-plus	products	to	our	platform.
New	areas	of	focus	for	us	are	investing	in	the	transition	of	the	economy	to	net-zero	carbon	emissions;	reinsurance;	
technology	investing,	where	we	are	moving	from	venture	into	full-scale	technology	private	equity	investing;	and	
LP	secondaries,	where	our	clients	are	increasingly	looking	for	scale	managers.	Each	of	these	areas	has	the	
potential	to	provide	a	meaningful	opportunity	for	our	clients	and	for	our	business.
CLIMATE TRANSITION TO NET ZERO IS REAL AND ACCELERATING
As	we	have	noted	for	many	years,	overall,	Brookfield	is	already	net	negative	on	scope	1	and	2	across	our	entire	
$600	billion	of	assets	under	management	on	an	avoided	emissions	basis.	We	believe	we	are	similarly	net-zero	
carbon	on	a	scope	3	basis	and	are	now	measuring	the	scope	3	emissions	of	our	portfolio	companies	in	detail.	
Having	transformed	our	own	business	from	a	very	intensive	generator	of	carbon	decades	ago	to	net-zero	carbon	
today,	we	believe	we	are	well	positioned	to	assist	others	with	this	change.	
With	decades	of	expertise	and	the	access	to	capital	that	we	possess,	we	plan	to	raise	capital	from	our	clients	to	
assist	other	companies	in	moving	to	net-zero	carbon.	We	are	committing	over	$2	billion	of	our	own	capital	to	our	
Global	Transition	Fund	and	will	be	investing	that	alongside	institutional	clients	who	are	like-minded	in	their	goals.	
We	believe	this	represents	a	unique	opportunity	to	create	a	new	asset	class	while	addressing	one	of	society’s	
current greatest needs. 
We	believe	the	world	is	at	the	beginning	of	a	30-year	movement	to	net-zero	carbon.	This	transition	will	affect	
virtually	every	business	in	every	country.	China,	currently	one	of	the	largest	generators	of	electricity	from	coal,	
has	recently	committed	to	being	net-zero	carbon	across	its	entire	economy	before	2060.	The	new	U.S.	
9 BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
administration	has	committed	to	clean	energy	by	2035,	and	the	EU,	the	U.K.	and	Canada	are	all	accelerating	their	
energy	transitions.	There	is	now	no	disputing	that	the	world	overall	is	moving	from	fossil	fuels	to	lower	carbon	
energy—renewables,	nuclear	energy	and	potentially	hydrogen.	
Within	the	envelope	of	net-zero	carbon,	we	will	continue	to	own	and	operate	certain	essential	infrastructure	
assets	globally	that	transport	fuel.	We	believe	that	natural	gas	will	play	an	important	role	in	this	energy	transition,	
particularly	in	Asia,	and	potentially	serve	as	a	bridge	to	hydrogen.	Rest	assured,	when	we	acquire	these	assets,	
we	will	be	laser	focused	on	the	duration	of	cash	flows,	and	we	will	operate	them	with	their	contributions	to	the	
transition	to	net-zero	carbon	in	mind	and	with	plans	to	ensure	they	continuously	do	better.	We	believe	the	
operating	experience	we	have	gained	in	transitioning	from	carbon-intensive	to	net-zero	carbon	ourselves	will	
make	us	better	owners	of	many	of	these	assets.
Our	Global	Transition	Fund	is	focused	on	the	build	out	of	new	renewables	globally,	as	well	as	the	operations	
surrounding	investment	by	businesses	to	accelerate	the	transition	to	net-zero	carbon.	There	are	many	companies	
that	will	have	the	capital	and	skills	to	do	this	themselves.	Equally,	there	will	be	many	that	need	our	operating	
expertise	and	access	to	capital	to	achieve	their	goals.	This	is	the	objective	of	our	new	fund,	and	we	are	excited	
about	what	it	can	accomplish.
A FEW THEMES ARE DRIVING OUR INVESTING IN 2021/2022
We	invest	in	all	of	our	businesses	to	maintain	and	grow	them,	but	we	seek	to	deploy	the	most	capital	in	businesses	
or	regions	at	opportunistic	points	in	time	when	the	opportunity	to	create	greater	incremental	value	exists.	This	
changes	constantly,	but	simply	stated,	we	try	to	stay	away	from	fairly	valued	markets	and	invest	where	capital	is	
in short supply.
Our	investing	is	also	driven	by	themes	that	generally	cross	all	of	our	funds	and	are	longer	term	in	nature.	The	
themes	that	we	believe	are	relevant	for	our	business	today	are	as	follows:
•  Low	interest	rates	will	continue	to	drive	demand	for	alternative	investments.	Interest	rates	appear	to	be	
set	to	stay	in	a	lowish	band	for	several	years.	As	a	result,	alternatives	are	very	attractive	to	investors.	This	
provides	an	exceptional	backdrop	for	our	overall	business.
•  Renewable	energy	is	growing.	The	global	electricity	make-up	is	currently	25%	from	renewable	sources,	and	
this	is	set	to	grow	to	50%	or	more	over	the	next	30	years.	The	investment	required	to	accomplish	this	is	in	
the tens of trillions of dollars. 
•  Technology	is	affecting	all	business,	as	it	always	has.	The	difference	today	is	the	pace	of	change,	which	brings	
with	it	great	opportunity,	but	also	risk.	We	are	embracing	this.
•  Alternative credit is here to stay. Capital from institutions and reinsurers will increasingly drive the credit 
markets.	Alternative	managers	have	the	opportunity	to	scale	up	credit	as	a	fixed	income	replacement	for	
institutional investors.
•  Most	real	estate	withstood	the	dramatic	shutdowns	in	2020,	and	while	some	property	will	be	used	in	new	
ways	in	the	future,	there	will	be	no	major	paradigm	shift.	Great	real	estate	in	great	cities	will	continue	to	be	
just	that.	This	will	become	evident	once	the	global	economy	recovers.
•  Many	businesses	and	governments	require	capital.	While	businesses	have	survived	thus	far	by	borrowing	
heavily,	they	now	need	equity.	As	a	result,	there	will	be	attractive	opportunities	to	invest	in	businesses,	and	
to acquire infrastructure from governments.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT 10
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU OWN A PIECE OF OUR BUSINESS
Lastly,	we	encourage	you	to	focus	on	our	business,	not	the	share	price.	If	there	was	ever	a	year	to	emphasize	this	
point,	it	was	2020.	Consider	that	the	Price	of	BAM	in	US$	on	a	split	adjusted	basis,	started	the	year	at	$38.58	and	
ended	the	year	at	$41.27.	With	a	dividend	of	1.25%,	you	earned	a	respectable	8%	on	your	investment	based	on	
the	share	price.	Except,	given	the	extremes	in	the	market	seen	in	2020,	and	depending	on	when	you	looked	at	the	
Price,	you	might	have	concluded	that	you	had	gained	18%	if	you	looked	in	February,	or	a	month	later	that	you	
were	down	44%	when	our	shares	traded	at	$21.57	in	March.	This	is	the	behavior	of	Price;	but	not	Value.
In	the	short	run,	Price	is	a	function	of	supply	and	demand	at	any	point	in	time,	which	is	often	influenced	by	the	
news	of	the	day,	short-term	results,	and	the	investor	view	of	macro	events	that	often	have	nothing	to	do	with	the	
company.	This	has	always	been	true,	and	is	even	more	so	today	with	the	emergence	of	ETFs,	indexing,	social	
media,	the	24-hour	news	cycle	and	all	the	information	bombarding	investors.	Value,	on	the	other	hand,	is	the	net	
present	value	of	future	cash	flows	based	on	assumptions	for	growth,	discounted	back	to	the	present	at	an	
appropriate	interest	rate.	The	Price	of	a	publicly	traded	security	is	very	often	not	the	Value	of	it;	sometimes	it	is	
higher,	and	sometimes	lower.	From	time	to	time	they	can	converge—but	not	that	often.
The	Value	of	Brookfield	based	on	our	published	plan	value	metrics	was	$57	at	the	start	of	2020	and	$66	at	the	
end.	After	accounting	for	the	dividend,	your	Value	increased	17%	over	the	year.	This	was	very	respectable,	
especially	given	the	environment,	and	it	included	write-downs	from	some	businesses	that	got	hit	in	the	short	
term with the shutdowns.
If	we	were	a	private	company,	we	would	simply	report	our	Value	calculation	and	the	metrics	behind	it.	You	would	
likely	have	been	thrilled	with	2020.	We	actually	were.	On	the	other	hand,	the	movement	of	Price	often	distracts	
investors	from	focusing	on	the	Value	of	a	business.	We	encourage	you	to	focus	on	Value	and	try	to	not	be	
distracted	by	Price.
CLOSING
We	remain	committed	to	being	a	world-class	asset	manager,	and	to	investing	capital	for	you	and	the	rest	of	our	
investment	partners	in	high-quality	assets	that	earn	solid	cash	returns	on	equity,	while	emphasizing	downside	
protection	for	the	capital	employed.	The	primary	objective	of	the	company	continues	to	be	to	generate	increasing	
cash	flows	on	a	per-share	basis,	and	as	a	result,	higher	intrinsic	value	per	share	over	the	longer	term.
And	do	not	hesitate	to	contact	any	of	us	should	you	have	suggestions,	questions,	comments	or	ideas	you	wish	 
to share.
Sincerely,
Bruce Flatt 
Chief	Executive	Officer

Value Creation
We	create	value	for	our	shareholders	by	increasing	both	the	value	of	our	Asset	Management	franchise	and	of	our	
Invested	Capital,	as	follows:
ASSET MANAGEMENT
1.  Increasing	fee-bearing	capital,	which	increases	our	fee-related	earnings.	We	track	the	value	thereby	created	
by	applying	a	multiple	to	our	current	fee-related	earnings.
2.  Achieving	attractive	investment	returns,	which	enables	us	to	earn	performance	income	(carried	interest).	We	
measure	the	value	thereby	created	by	applying	a	multiple	to	our	target	carried	interest,	net	of	costs.1
INVESTED CAPITAL
3.  Increasing	the	cash	income	generated	by	the	investments	as	well	as	capital	appreciation,	through	operational	
improvements	and	disciplined	recycling	of	the	underlying	assets.	We	measure	the	value	thereby	created	
using	a	combination	of	market	values	and	fair	values	as	determined	under	IFRS.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT 14
NOTICE TO READERS
Pages 1 through 14 of the 2020 Annual Report must be read in conjunction with the cautionary statements included 
elsewhere in the 2020 Annual Report. Except where otherwise indicated, the information provided herein is based 
on matters as they exist as of December 31, 2020 and not as any future date.
In addition, for pages 1 through 14 of the 2020 Annual Report, the following terms have the definitions provided 
below:
Current fee-related earnings are annualized fee revenues net of associated direct costs. Annualized fee revenues 
are the sum of (i) base management fees on current fee-bearing capital based on the associated contractual fee 
rates; (ii) incentive distributions based on BEP, BIP and BPY’s current annual distribution policies; (iii) performance 
fees from BBU assuming a 10% annualized unit price appreciation; and (iv) transaction and public securities 
performance fees equal to a simple average of the last two years’ revenues. We assume that direct costs represent 
40% of current fee revenues from Brookfield funds and 70% on Oaktree funds.
Plan value is used to measure value creation for business planning and performance measurement. The metrics 
used  in  the  measurement  of  plan  value  include  current  fee-related  earnings,  target  carried  interest,  net, 
accumulated unrealized carried interest, net and invested capital, net. The multiples applied to current fee-related 
earnings and target carried interest, net to determine plan value reflect Brookfield’s estimates of appropriate 
multiples used in the alternative asset management industry based on, among other things, industry reports.
Target carried interest, net is target carried interest net of associated direct costs. Target carried interest 
represents the carried interest we will earn, straight-lined over the life of the fund, assuming that we achieve the 
target fund returns. This is calculated by multiplying carry eligible fund capital by the net target return of a fund and 
the fund’s carried interest percentage. Target gross returns are typically 20%+ for opportunistic funds; 13% to 15% 
for value add funds; 12% to 15% for credit and core funds.  Fee terms vary by investment strategy (carried interest is 
approximately 15% to 20% subject to a preferred return and catch-up) and may change over time. Target carried 
interest on uncalled fund commitments is discounted for two years at 10%. We assume that direct costs represent 
30% of target carried interest on Brookfield funds and 50% on Oaktree funds. There can be no assurance that 
targeted returns will be met.

STATEMENT REGARDING USE OF NON-IFRS MEASURES
We disclose a number of financial measures in this Report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”). We utilize these measures in managing the business, including for performance measurement, capital 
allocation and valuation purposes and believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our IFRS 
results is helpful to investors in assessing the overall performance of our businesses. These financial measures should not be 
considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, similar 
financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. We caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures or other 
financial metrics may differ from the calculations disclosed by other businesses and, as a result, may not be comparable to 
similar measures presented by other issuers and entities. Reconciliations of these non-IFRS financial measures to the most 
directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, where applicable, are included 
within this Report. Please refer to our Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115 for all non-IFRS measures.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    18 
PART 1 – OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
OVERVIEW
We are a leading global alternative asset manager1 with a history spanning over 100 years. We have $600 billion of assets 
under management1 across a broad portfolio of real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity and credit. Our 
$312 billion in fee-bearing capital1 is invested on behalf of some of the world’s largest institutional investors, sovereign wealth 
funds and pension plans, along with thousands of individuals.
We provide a diverse product mix of private funds1 and dedicated public vehicles, which allow investors to invest in our five 
key asset classes and participate in the strong performance of the underlying portfolio. We invest in a disciplined manner, 
targeting returns of 12-15% over the long-term with strong downside protection, allowing our investors and their stakeholders 
to meet their goals and protect their financial futures. 
ü	Investment focus
  We predominantly invest in real assets across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and private equity, and hold a 
significant investment in Oaktree Capital Management (“Oaktree”)1, which is a leading global alternative investment 
management firm with an expertise in credit.
ü	Diverse product offering
  We offer public and private vehicles to invest across a number of product lines, including core, value-add, and 
opportunistic growth equity and credit strategies in both closed-end and perpetual vehicles.
ü	Focused investment strategies 
  We invest where we can bring our competitive advantages to bear, such as our strong capabilities as an owner-operator, 
our large-scale capital and our global reach.
ü	Disciplined financing approach 
  We employ leverage1 in a prudent manner to enhance returns while preserving capital throughout business cycles. 
Underlying investments are typically funded at investment-grade levels on a standalone and non-recourse basis, providing 
us with a stable capitalization. Only 6% of the total leverage reported in our consolidated financial statements has recourse 
to the Corporation.
ü	Sustainability
We are committed to ensuring that the assets and businesses in which we invest are set up for long-term success, and we 
seek to have a positive impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate. 
In addition, we maintain significant invested capital1 on the Corporation’s balance sheet where we invest alongside our 
investors. This capital generates annual cash flows that enhance the returns we earn as an asset manager, create a strong 
alignment of interest, and enable us to bring the following strengths to bear on all our investments:
1. Large-scale capital
  We have approximately $600 billion in assets under management and $312 billion in fee-bearing capital.
2. Operating expertise 
  We have approximately 150,000 operating employees worldwide focused on maximizing value and cash flows from our 
assets and businesses.
3. Global reach 
  We operate in more than 30 countries on five continents around the world.
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
19    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
The value of the business is comprised of two key components: Our asset management activities that we refer to as Asset 
Management, and our balance sheet investments that we refer to as Invested Capital. Our financial returns are represented by 
the combination of the earnings of our Asset Management business, as well as capital appreciation and distributions from our 
Invested Capital. The primary performance measure we use is funds from operations (“FFO”)1 which we use to evaluate the 
performance of our segments. 
Asset Management 
Our Asset Management activities encompass $312 billion of fee-bearing capital across a broad portfolio of real estate, 
infrastructure, renewable power, private equity and credit, and we have approximately $33 billion of additional committed 
capital that will be fee-bearing when invested. This capital is managed within long-term private funds, perpetual strategies and 
public securities1. Together with our investment in Oaktree, we have approximately 2,000 unique institutional investors across 
our private funds business. 
Fee-Bearing Capital Diversification
AS AT DEC. 31, 2020
Long-term Private Funds – $84 billion fee-bearing capital 
We manage and earn fees on a diverse range of real estate, renewable power, infrastructure, private equity and credit funds. 
These funds are long duration in nature and include closed-end value-add, credit and opportunistic strategies. On long-term 
private fund capital, we earn:
1. Diversified and long-term base management fees1 on capital that is typically committed for ten years with two one-year 
extension options. 
2. Carried interest1, which enables us to receive a portion of overall fund profits provided that our investors receive a 
minimum prescribed preferred return. Carried interest is recognized when a fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of 
preferred returns and when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. 
Perpetual Strategies – $94 billion fee-bearing capital 
We manage perpetual capital in our publicly listed affiliates1, as well as core and core plus private funds, which can continually 
raise new capital. From our perpetual strategies, we earn: 
1. Long-term perpetual base management fees, which as general partner of our listed affiliates, are based on total 
capitalization of our listed affiliates and the net asset value (“NAV”) of our perpetual private funds.  
2. Stable incentive distributions1 which are linked to cash distributions from listed affiliates (BPY/BPYU, BEP/BEPC and 
BIP/BIPC) that exceed  pre-determined thresholds. These cash distributions have a historical track record of growing 
annually and each of these listed affiliates target annual distribution growth rates within a range of 5-9%.
3. Performance fees1 based on unit price performance (BBU) and carried interest on our perpetual private funds. 
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115. 
2. Credit Strategies have been allocated across long-term private funds, perpetual strategies and other.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    20 
Asset Management (continued)
Credit Strategies – $121 billion fee-bearing capital 
We hold an approximate 62% interest in Oaktree, which provides a diverse range of long-term private fund and perpetual 
strategies to its investor base. Similar to our long-term private funds, we earn base management fees and carried interest on 
Oaktree’s fund capital.
Public Securities – $13 billion fee-bearing capital 
We manage publicly listed funds and separately managed accounts, focused on fixed income and equity securities across real 
estate, infrastructure and natural resources. We earn base management fees, which are based on committed capital and fund 
NAV, and performance income based on investment returns. 
Invested Capital 
We have approximately $58 billion of invested capital on our balance sheet as a result of our history as an owner and operator 
of real assets. This capital provides attractive financial returns and important stability and flexibility to our asset management 
business. 
Key attributes of our invested capital: 
• Transparent – approximately 81% of our invested capital is in our listed affiliates and other smaller publicly traded 
investments. The remainder is primarily held in a residential homebuilding business, and a few other directly held 
investments. 
• Diversified, long-term, stable cash flows – received from our underlying public investments. These cash flows are 
underpinned by investments in real assets which should provide inflation protection and less volatility compared to 
traditional equities, and higher yields compared to fixed income. 
• Strong alignment of interest with our investors – we are the largest investor into each of our listed affiliates, and in turn, 
the listed affiliates are typically the largest investor in each of our private funds.  
21    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
We have three distinct competitive advantages that enable us to consistently identify and acquire high-quality assets and create 
significant value in the assets that we own and operate.  
Large-Scale Capital 
We have approximately $600 billion in assets under management.
We offer our investors a large portfolio of private funds that have global mandates and diversified strategies. Our access to 
large-scale, flexible capital enables us to pursue transactions of a size that lessens competition. In addition, investing significant 
amounts of our own capital either through our listed affiliates or through our own balance sheet ensures strong alignment of 
interest with our investors. 
Operating Expertise
We have approximately 150,000 operating employees worldwide who are instrumental in maximizing the value and cash flows 
from our operations.
We believe that strong operating experience is essential in maximizing efficiency and productivity – and ultimately, returns. 
We do this by maintaining a culture of long-term focus, alignment of interest and collaboration through the people we hire and 
our operating philosophy. This in-house operating expertise developed through our heritage as an owner-operator is invaluable 
in underwriting acquisitions and executing value-creating development and capital projects.
Global Reach
We operate in more than 30 countries on five continents around the world. 
Our global reach allows us to diversify and identify a broad range of opportunities. We are able to invest where capital is 
scarce, and our scale enables us to move quickly and pursue multiple opportunities across different markets. Our global reach 
also allows us to operate our assets more effectively: we believe that a strong on-the-ground presence is critical to operating 
successfully in many of our markets, and many of our businesses are truly local. Furthermore, the combination of our strong 
local presence and global reach allows us to bring global relationships and operating practices to bear across markets to 
enhance returns.  
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    22 
INVESTMENT CYCLE
Raise Capital
As an asset manager, the starting point is establishing new funds and other investment products for investors. This in turn 
provides the capital to invest, from which we earn base management fees, incentive distributions and performance-based 
returns such as carried interest. Accordingly, we create value by increasing our amount of fee-bearing capital and by 
achieving strong investment performance that leads to increased cash flows and asset values.
Identify and Acquire High-Quality Assets
We follow a value-based approach to investing and allocating capital. We believe that our disciplined approach, global reach 
and our operating expertise enable us to identify a wide range of potential opportunities, and allow us to invest at attractive 
valuations  and  generate  superior  risk-adjusted  returns.  We  also  leverage  our  considerable  expertise  in  executing 
recapitalizations, operational turnarounds and large development and capital projects, providing additional opportunities to 
deploy capital. 
Secure Long-Term Financing
We finance our operations predominantly on a long-term investment-grade basis, and most of our capital consists of equity 
and standalone asset-by-asset financing with minimal recourse to other parts of the organization. We utilize relatively modest 
levels of corporate debt to provide operational flexibility and optimize returns. This provides us with considerable stability, 
improves our ability to withstand financial downturns and enables our management teams to focus on operations and other 
growth initiatives.
Enhance Value and Cash Flows Through Operating Expertise
Our strong, time-tested operating capabilities enable us to increase the value of the assets within our businesses and the cash 
flows they produce, and they help to protect capital in adverse conditions. Our operating expertise, development capabilities 
and effective financing can help ensure that an investment’s full value creation potential is realized, which we believe is one 
of our most important competitive advantages.
Realize Capital from Asset Sales or Refinancings
We actively monitor opportunities to sell or refinance assets to generate proceeds; in our limited life funds that capital is 
returned to investors, and in the case of our perpetual funds, we then redeploy the capital to enhance returns. In many cases, 
returning capital from private funds completes the investment process, locks in investor returns and gives rise to performance 
income.
Our Operating Cycle Leads to Value Creation 
We  create  value  from  earning  robust  returns  on  our 
investments  that  compound  over  time  and  grow  our  fee-
bearing capital. By generating value for our investors and 
shareholders, we increase fees and carried interest received in 
our asset management business, and grow cash flows that 
compound value in our invested capital.  
23    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Corporation has $7 billion of liquidity and $77 billion on a group basis as at December 31, 2020, and we manage our 
liquidity and capitalization on a group-wide basis, which we organize into three principal tiers: 
i) The Corporation: 
• Strong levels of liquidity are maintained to support growth and ongoing operations.
• Capitalization consists of a large common equity base, supplemented with perpetual preferred shares, long-dated 
corporate bonds and, from time to time, draws on our corporate credit facilities.
• Negligible guarantees are provided on the financial obligations of listed affiliates and managed funds.
• High levels of cash flows are available after payment of common share dividends.
ii) Our listed affiliates (BPY/BPYU, BEP/BEPC, BIP/BIPC and BBU):
• Strong levels of liquidity are maintained at each of the listed affiliates to support their growth and ongoing operations.
• Listed affiliates are intended to be self-funding with stable capitalization through market cycles.
• Financial obligations have no recourse to the Corporation.
iii) Managed funds, or investments, either held directly or within listed affiliates:  
• Each underlying investment is typically funded on a standalone basis.
• Fund level borrowings are generally limited to subscription facilities backed by the capital commitments to the fund.
• Financial obligations have no recourse to the Corporation.
Approach to Capitalization
We maintain a prudent level of long-dated capitalization in the form of common equity, perpetual preferred shares and 
corporate bonds, which provides a very stable capital structure. In addition, we maintain appropriate levels of liquidity 
throughout the organization to fund operating, development and investment activities as well as unforeseen requirements. 
A key element of our capital strategy is to maintain significant liquidity at the corporate level, primarily in the form of cash, 
financial assets and undrawn credit lines. 
Within our listed affiliates and private funds, we strive to:
• Ensure  our  listed  affiliates  can  finance  their  operations  on  a  standalone  basis  without  recourse  to  or  reliance 
on the Corporation.
• Structure borrowings and other financial obligations associated with assets or portfolio companies in our private funds to 
provide a stable capitalization at levels that are attractive to investors, are sustainable on a long-term basis and can 
withstand business cycles.
• Ensure the vast majority of this debt is at investment-grade levels; however, periodically, we may borrow at sub-
investment grade levels in certain parts of our business where the borrowings are carefully structured and monitored. 
• Provide recourse only to the specific businesses or assets being financed, without cross-collateralization or parental 
guarantees. 
• Match the duration of our debt to the underlying leases or contracts and match the currency of our debt to that of the assets 
such that our remaining exposure is on the net equity of the investment.
As at December 31, 2020, only $9 billion of long-term debt has recourse to the Corporation. The remaining debt on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet is held within managed entities and has no recourse to the Corporation but is consolidated under 
IFRS.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    24 
Liquidity
• The Corporation has very few capital requirements. Nevertheless, we maintain significant liquidity ($7 billion in the 
form of cash and financial assets and undrawn credit facilities as at December 31, 2020) at the corporate level to 
bridge larger fund transactions, seed new fund products, invest in businesses alongside our fund investors or 
participate in equity issuances by our listed affiliates.
• On a group basis, we have approximately $77 billion of liquidity, which includes corporate liquidity, listed affiliate 
liquidity and uncalled private fund commitments. Uncalled private fund commitments are third-party commitments 
available for drawdown in our private funds.

Capital Management
We utilize a metric we call the Corporation’s Capital to manage the business in a number of ways, including operating 
performance, value creation, credit metrics and capital efficiency. The performance of the Corporation’s Capital is closely 
tracked and monitored by the company’s key management personnel and evaluated relative to management’s objectives. The 
primary goal of the company is to earn a 12-15% return compounded over the long-term while always maintaining excess 
capital to support ongoing operations.
The Corporation’s Capital consists of the capital invested in its asset management activities, including investments in entities 
that it manages, its corporate investments that are held outside of managed entities and its net working capital, and is computed 
as follows: 
AS AT DEC. 31 2020 2019

We maintain a prudent level of capitalization at the Corporation with 72% of our book capitalization in the form of common 
and preferred equity. Consistent with our conservative approach, our corporate borrowings represent only 18% of our corporate 
book capitalization and equate to just 6% of our consolidated debt.
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
25    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
The remaining 94% of our consolidated debt is non-recourse and is held within managed entities and has virtually no cross-
collateralization or parental guarantees by the Corporation. 
The following table presents our total capitalization on a corporate and consolidated basis. Total capitalization also includes 
amounts payable under long-term incentive plans, fixed annuity liabilities fully backed by financial asset portfolios, deferred 
tax liabilities and other working capital balances:

Cash Flow Generation from our Capital
Our Corporation’s Capital generates significant, recurring cash flows at the corporate level, which may be used for (i) 
reinvestment into the business; or (ii) returning cash to shareholders. These cash flows are underpinned by:
• Fee-related earnings2 that are supported by long-term and perpetual contractual agreements. 
• Distributions from listed investments that are stable and backed by high-quality operating assets.
These cash flows are supplemented with carried interest as we monetize mature investments and return capital to our investors.
Cash available for distribution and/or reinvestment1 was $3.1 billion for 2020, and over the past five years has grown at a 9% 
compound annual growth rate.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
Our Approach
Managing risk is an integral and critical part of our business. We have a well-established, proactive and disciplined risk 
management approach that is based on clear operating methods and a strong risk management culture. We ensure that we have 
the necessary capacity and resilience to respond to changing environments by evaluating both current and emerging risks. We 
adhere to a robust risk management framework and methodology that is designed to enable comprehensive and consistent 
management of risk across the organization. 
We use a thorough and integrated risk assessment process to identify and evaluate risk areas across the business such as human 
capital, climate change, liquidity, disruption, compliance and other strategic, financial, regulatory and operational risks. 
Management and mitigation approaches and practices are tailored to the specific risk areas and executed by business and 
functional groups for their businesses, with appropriate coordination and oversight through monitoring and reporting processes.

Focus on Risk Culture
A strong risk culture is the cornerstone of our risk management program: one that promotes measured and appropriate risk-
taking, addresses current and emerging risks and ensures employees conduct business with a long-term perspective and in a 
sustainable and ethical manner. This culture is reinforced by strong commitment and leadership from our senior executives, as 
well as the policies and practices we have implemented, including our compensation approach.
Shared Execution
Given the diversified and decentralized nature of our operations, we seek to ensure that risk is managed as close to its source 
as possible and by the management teams that have the most knowledge and expertise in the specific business or risk area. 
As such, business specific risks overall—such as safety, environment and other operational risks—are generally managed at the 
operating business group level, as the risks vary based on the nature of each business. At the same time, we monitor many of 
these risks organization-wide to ensure adequacy of risk management, adherence to applicable Brookfield policies, and sharing 
of best practices. 
For risks that are more pervasive and correlated in their impact across the organization—such as liquidity, foreign exchange 
and interest rates or where we can bring specialized knowledge—we utilize a centralized approach amongst our corporate and 
our operating business groups. Management of strategic, reputational and regulatory compliance risks are similarly coordinated 
to ensure consistent focus and implementation across the organization.
Oversight & Coordination
We have implemented strong governance practices to monitor and oversee our risk management program. Management 
committees bring together required expertise to manage key risk areas, ensuring appropriate application and coordination of 
approaches and practices across our business and functional groups, and include the following:
• Risk Management Steering Committee – supports the overall corporate risk management program, and coordinates risk 
assessment and mitigation on an enterprise-wide basis
• Investment Committees – oversees the investment process and reviews and approves investment transactions
• Conflicts Committee – resolves potential conflict situations in the investment process and other corporate transactions
• Financial Risk Oversight Committee – reviews and monitors financial exposure
• Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee – oversees ESG initiatives, with a focus on health, 
safety, security and environmental matters
• Disclosure Committee – oversees the public disclosure of material information
Brookfield’s Board of Directors oversees risk management with a focus on more significant risks, and leverages management’s 
monitoring processes. The Board has delegated responsibility for oversight of specific risks to the following board committees:
• Risk Management Committee – oversees the management of Brookfield’s significant financial and non-financial risk 
exposures, including review of risk assessment and risk management practices, and confirms that the company has an 
appropriate risk-taking philosophy and suitable risk capacity
• Audit Committee – oversees the management of risks related to Brookfield’s systems and procedures for financial 
reporting, as well as for associated audit processes (internal and external)
• Management Resources and Compensation Committee – oversees risks related to Brookfield’s management resource 
planning, including succession planning, executive compensation and senior executives’ performance
• Governance and Nominating Committee – oversees risks related to Brookfield’s governance structure, including the 
effectiveness of board and committee activities and potential conflicts of interest

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) MANAGEMENT
ESG at Brookfield
We believe that acting responsibly toward our stakeholders is fundamental to operating a productive, profitable and sustainable 
business. This underlies our philosophy of conducting business with a long-term perspective in a sustainable and ethical 
manner. Our bottom line is that having robust ESG principles and practices is good business for a wide variety of reasons, and 
we have been imbedding many of these into our asset management activities and underlying business operations for many 
years. 
Brookfield’s Board of Directors, through the Governance and Nominating Committee, has ultimate oversight of Brookfield’s 
ESG strategy and receives regular updates on the company’s ESG initiatives throughout the year. The ESG Steering 
Committee, which comprises senior executives from BAM and each of our business groups, is the primary decision-making 
body on all ESG matters and drives ESG initiatives based on our business imperatives, industry developments and best 
practices.  The  Steering  Committee  executes  its  mandate  through  the  ESG  Working  Group,  comprising  operational 
professionals from each of these constituencies.  
We incorporate ESG factors into our investment decisions, starting with the due diligence of a potential investment through to 
the exit process. During the initial due diligence phase, we utilize our operating expertise and industry-specific engagement 
guidance to identify material ESG risks and opportunities relevant to the potential investment. We perform deeper due 
diligence if required, utilizing internal experts and third-party advisors as needed. All investments made by the company are 
approved by our investment committees based on a comprehensive set of predetermined criteria that evaluate potential risks, 
mitigants and opportunities. ESG matters are part of this evaluation, including anti-bribery and corruption, health and safety, 
and other environmental, social and governance considerations.
As part of each acquisition, the investment teams create a tailored integration plan that, among other things, includes material 
ESG-related matters for review or execution. ESG risks and opportunities through the investment’s life cycle are identified and 
assessed during due diligence and then actively managed by each portfolio company with support from the investment team 
responsible for the investment. This recognizes the importance of local expertise, which provides valuable insight given the 
wide range of asset types and locations in which we invest, coupled with Brookfield’s broad investment expertise. We believe 
there is a strong correlation between actively managing all facets of ESG effectively and enhancing investment returns.
The below provides a summary of select ESG initiatives undertaken during the year. For additional information please refer to 
Brookfield’s ESG report, which can be accessed on the Responsibility page of the Corporation’s website.
Environmental
We believe that our operating businesses are well positioned as the world transitions toward a net zero-carbon economy. 
Our renewable power business continues to be one of the largest pure-play global owners and operators of hydroelectric, wind 
and solar power generation facilities and is committed to supporting the global transition toward a net zero-carbon economy.  
Further, we are one of the world’s largest owners of real estate and our office and retail portfolios are heavily weighted towards 
properties that meet high environmental sustainability standards consistent with the expectations of our tenants, which we view 
as enhancing rental revenues and lowering operating costs. Our infrastructure and private equity businesses include a wide 
variety of businesses, many of which are well positioned to have a positive environmental impact and benefit from our focus on 
operational efficiency, including energy efficiency. 
From a decarbonization standpoint, we intend to be a leader in both driving the transition to net zero and measuring and 
reporting on the same, in line with industry standards. We are working from a strong foundation and intend to do more. This 
includes enhancing our climate change mitigation and adaptation processes to ensure they are properly factored into our 
governance and risk management protocols and measuring and monitoring our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions across the 
business. The latest GHG emissions information for our asset management business is available in our 2019 ESG report.  
We continue our work to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(“TCFD”). We have assessed our practices against TCFD recommendations, and are following an implementation roadmap for 
continued progress in our alignment. 
We have also been active in the sustainable finance market, with issuances in 2020 reaching more than $3.5 billion across green 
bonds, sustainability-linked debt and green preferred shares, up from $2.7 billion from last year. Some of our assets and 
investments are well-suited for sustainable financing, and we continue to look for opportunities to access capital in this manner.
29    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Social
We value our 2,000 asset management employees and we actively seek opportunities to develop them and to ensure they are 
engaged. Our commitment to a positive, open and inclusive work environment in all of our offices globally creates an 
environment that encourages strong relationships, provides an environment conducive to development and enables us to benefit 
from diverse perspectives, further enhancing our ability to add value to our people. We also recognize that we must be positive 
contributors to the communities in which we operate and not just an employer.
In addition to having a positive impact on the communities in which we operate, philanthropic and other community activities 
are an opportunity to increase the engagement of our teams and support the development of our people. The COVID-19 
pandemic was a focus for our philanthropic efforts during the year, and we were able to use the breadth of our global footprint 
to support relief efforts around the world. This included making donations, either in cash or supplies, to health organizations 
and other not-for-profit organizations focused on vulnerable members of our communities. We also expanded our global gift 
matching program from a one-to-one to a two-to-one match for COVID-19 related donations, and we worked with our 
operating businesses to find numerous ways in which to support relief efforts. Examples of these relief efforts include offering 
our retail parking lots for blood drives, food banks and mobile COVID-19 testing sites; providing hotel rooms for first 
responders; and feeding furloughed workers and their families out of hotel kitchens.
A focus on diversity and inclusion is another aspect of a positive work environment and our efforts in this regard have resulted 
in significant progress. Specifically, over the last five years, we have more than doubled our employee population in the asset 
management business and during this period, we have also doubled our female representation at the most senior level of the 
organization; Managing Partner/Managing Director female representation increased from 6% to 13% and Senior Vice President 
representation increased from 14% to 34%. In 2020, we broadened our focus beyond gender to include ethnic diversity. As a 
first step we created a Global Diversity Advisory Group to support this effort. The initial mandate of the group is to provide 
insights into the concerns, challenges, and successes around attracting and retaining members of the Black community within 
North America. Early initiatives include the development of a process for employees to self-identify their ethnicity to help us 
identify where to focus on increasing ethnic diversity.  In addition, this group is providing support in the areas of recruiting, and 
diversity and inclusion education. 
Finally, while the health and safety of our employees has always been a priority, it required additional  focus as we managed 
through the COVID-19 pandemic. In each of our locations, as soon as it was permissible, and subject to individual personal 
health considerations, we brought our employees back to the office. We believe this was important to reinforce our culture of 
collaboration, enable the development of our employees and benefit their mental health. There were four key principles we 
followed to accomplish this safely: adherence to local requirements, strong safety protocols—often exceeding government 
requirements, mitigating the risk through continuous reviews of changing protocols, and respect for each employee’s privacy. 
The safety protocols included installation of glass partitions between workspaces, access to regular, free COVID-19 testing and 
clear protocols for addressing situations where an employee contracted COVID-19. 
Health and safety in the workplace also represent an integral part of how our businesses are managed. As health and safety risk 
varies across industry sectors and the nature of operations, we emphasize the importance of having operating businesses 
directly accountable and responsible for managing and reporting risks within their operations, while Brookfield provides an 
important level of oversight and support. For details on our operational health and safety framework as it relates to our 
operating businesses, please refer to Brookfield’s 2019 ESG report.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    30 
Governance
We continue to prioritize our data privacy and security. In 2020, we undertook initiatives to further protect our environment by 
enhancing our access controls and anti-malware protections, and improving our detection and response capabilities through the 
use of automated technologies. Annually we review our cybersecurity program and periodically we have an external party 
assess our program maturity based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The results of the recent assessment validated the 
strength  of  our  program.  Finally,  in  addition  to  continued  mandatory  cybersecurity  education  for  all  employees,  we 
implemented additional training for specific groups, such as new employees or employees in roles where the impact of a cyber 
incident is greatest (e.g., finance teams, human resources). The strength of this effort was evidenced through improved results 
in our phishing simulations. 
Finally, we continue to align our business practices with leading frameworks for responsible investing and demonstrate our 
commitment by serving as a member and active participant in industry forums and other organizations.  In early 2020, we 
became a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”), which reinforces the 
incorporation of ESG into our investment management activities. We also are active members of several sustainability 
organizations, such as Accounting for Sustainability (“A4S”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) 
Alliance. Through our membership in these organizations, we remain actively involved in discussions aimed at advancing ESG 
awareness across private and public markets and enhance our reporting and protocols in line with evolving best practices.

PART 2 – REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
The following section contains a discussion and analysis of line items presented within our consolidated financial statements. 
The financial data in this section has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Starting on page 44 we provide an overview of 
our fair value accounting process and why we believe it provides useful information for investors about our performance. We 
also provide an overview of our application of the control-based model under IFRS used to determine whether or not an 
investment should be consolidated.
OVERVIEW
During 2020, we benefited from strong results and growth within our asset management businesses, while many of our 
underlying businesses generated strong operating performance throughout the year. 
Net  income  was  $707  million  in  the  current  year,  with  a  $134  million  loss  attributable  to  common  shareholders 
($0.12 per share) and the remaining income attributable to non-controlling interests.  
The $4.6 billion decrease in consolidated net income and the $2.9 billion decrease in net income attributable to common 
shareholders were primarily attributable to:
• valuation losses of $1.7 billion in our real estate business both on consolidated and equity accounted investment properties 
mostly within our retail properties;
• an income tax expense of $837 million compared to $495 million in the prior year. The prior period benefited from the 
recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses; and
• higher depreciation expense primarily as a result of recent acquisitions; partially offset by
• contributions from acquisitions over the last twelve months.
Our consolidated balance sheet increased as a result of assets acquired, net of liabilities, from business combinations completed 
in the year, most notably our acquisition of Summit Digitel Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (“Summit DigiTel”)1, a telecom tower 
operation in India and IndoStar Capital Finance Limited (“IndoStar”)1, an Indian financing company. In addition, other 
financial assets increased primarily due to financial asset positions entered into during the year. Our cash and cash equivalents 
increased as a result of net proceeds from corporate debt issuances. These increases were partially offset by depreciation and a 
decrease in intangible assets due to dispositions.

1. Adjusted to reflect the three-for-two split effective April 1, 2020.
2020 vs. 2019
Revenues for the year were $62.8 billion, a decrease of $5.1 billion compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of the global 
economic shutdown, including:
• lower volumes at Greenergy Fuels Holdings Limited (“Greenergy”)1, a road fuel distribution business. Included within 
Greenergy’s revenues and direct costs are import duties that are passed through to the customers. These are recorded on a 
gross basis in revenues and direct costs without impact on the margin generated by the business, and as a result there was 
an equal impact on costs;
• lower contributions from our U.K. construction service business; and
• lower revenues at our hospitality assets held within our Real Estate segment due to closures and cancellations which 
reduced occupancy levels, primarily at the Atlantis Paradise Island Resort (“Atlantis”)1 and Center Parcs U.K. properties; 
partially offset by
• a full year of contributions from acquisitions completed in 2019, including Clarios Global LP (“Clarios”)1, Healthscope 
Limited (“Healthscope”)1 and Sagen MI Canada Inc. (“Sagen”, formerly referred to as “Genworth MI Canada Inc.”)1, as 
well as acquisitions completed during the year and the benefits of organic growth from our midstream and utilities 
operations, net of the impact of foreign exchange in our Infrastructure segment.
A  discussion  of  the  impact  on  revenues  and  net  income  from  recent  acquisitions  and  dispositions  can  be  found  on 
pages 35 and 36.
Direct costs decreased by 10% or $5.3 billion compared to a 7% decrease in revenues. The decrease is primarily due to the 
aforementioned lower volumes at Greenergy and cost saving initiatives across a number of our businesses. These decreases 
were offset by higher direct costs related to recent acquisitions, net of dispositions, as well as incremental costs associated with 
organic growth initiatives at our operations.
Other income and gains of $785 million relate primarily to the sale of Nova Cold Logistics ULC (“Nova Cold”)1 in the first 
quarter, Simply Storage Inc. and Healthscope’s pathology business in the fourth quarter, as well as the partial sale of Dalrymple 
Bay Coal Terminal (“DBCT”)1 in the fourth quarter. 
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
33    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
We recorded an equity accounted loss of $79 million this year compared to an equity accounted income of $2.5 billion in the 
prior year. The decrease of $2.6 billion primarily relates to:
• valuation losses in our core retail portfolio as we made adjustments to the discounted cash flows in light of the economic 
shutdown; partially offset by
• a deferred tax recovery at our Brazilian data center operations in our Infrastructure segment and strong operating 
performance at Norbord Inc. (“Norbord”)1.
Interest expense of $7.2 billion remained consistent over the prior year as the benefits from lower interest rates on the recently 
issued borrowings and our variable rate debt held at our real estate operations were offset by additional interest expense paid on 
new debt offerings.
We recorded fair value losses of $1.4 billion, compared to $831 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of: 
• valuation losses resulting from revised valuation assumptions, including rental growth and leasing assumptions, in our core 
retail and core office portfolios; partially offset by
• valuation gains in our LP investments portfolio, including our life sciences portfolio held within Forest City Realty Trust, 
Inc. (“Forest City”)1. 
Refer to pages 36 and 37 for discussion on fair value changes.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $915 million to $5.8 billion due to businesses acquired in the year, as well 
as the impact of revaluation gains in the fourth quarter of 2019, which increased the current year’s opening balance of our 
property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) from which the current year depreciation is determined. These increases were partially 
offset by the impact of recent dispositions and foreign exchange.
Income tax expense increased by $342 million primarily attributable to the absence of the prior year deferred income tax 
recovery of $475 million which relates to the recognition of deferred tax assets due to the projected utilization of net operating 
loss carryforwards.
2019 vs. 2018
Revenues increased by $11.1 billion in 2019 primarily due to the acquisitions during 2019 and 2018 across each of our listed 
affiliates, most notably the purchase of Clarios in the second quarter of 2019, and the purchase of Westinghouse Electric 
Company (“Westinghouse”)1, a leading supplier of infrastructure services to the power industry, in the third quarter of 2018. 
Same-store growth was attributable largely to the utilities and transport operations in our Infrastructure segment, strong leasing 
activity in our core office assets in the Real Estate segment, as well as higher realized pricing in our Renewable Power 
segment. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from our road fuel distribution business and the absence of 
revenues from businesses sold in 2019 and 2018.
Direct costs increased by $7.2 billion in 2019 due to the acquisitions and growth initiatives as discussed above. These increases 
were partially offset by the impact of adopting IFRS 16, the new lease accounting standard, which reallocated operating lease 
expenses previously reported through direct costs to interest expense and depreciation and amortization.
Other income and gains of $1.3 billion in 2019 include gains from the sale of our businesses, including BGIS, BGRS and our 
residential management services company all in the second quarter of 2019.
Equity accounted income increased from $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion primarily related to valuation gains at certain Brookfield 
Property REIT Inc. (“BPR”)1 properties and our Canary Wharf investment. These increases were partially offset by decreases 
in earnings from our investment in Norbord due to lower product pricing compared to 2018.
Interest expense increased by $2.4 billion as a result of additional borrowings associated with acquisitions across our portfolio, 
the addition of debt within newly acquired businesses, and additional interest expense from lease liabilities recognized on 
adoption of IFRS 16. 
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    34 
We recorded fair value losses of $831 million in 2019, compared to gains of $1.8 billion in 2018, primarily as a result of: 
• higher transaction related expenses, primarily attributable to a number of acquisitions across our portfolios; 
• higher impairment and provisions related to businesses within our Private Equity segment; and
• the absence of large step-up gains reported in 2018 related to the acquisition of Teekay Offshore1 (now known as “Altera”) 
and privatization of GGP Inc. (“GGP”)1; partially offset by
• higher appraisal gains on investment properties in our Real Estate segment.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.8 billion to $4.9 billion primarily from the impact of acquisitions, as 
well as the impact of revaluation gains in the fourth quarter of 2018, which increased the carrying value of our PP&E from 
which depreciation is determined. The adoption of IFRS 16 also increased depreciation charges in 2019.
Income tax expense was $495 million in 2019, compared to a $248 million recovery in 2018. This increase in income tax 
expense was primarily due to higher taxable income in flow-through entities attributed to Brookfield compared to 2018 and a 
lower amount of loss carryforwards recognized in 2019.

Acquisitions
Acquisitions over the past year contributed incremental revenues and net income of $7.4 billion and $49 million in the current 
year, respectively.
Real Estate
Recent acquisitions contributed incremental revenues of $420 million and net loss of $147 million in 2020. The most 
significant contributions were from acquisitions made through Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners III (“BSREP III”), 
which added $382 million of revenues and $164 million of net loss in the current year. The net loss is largely due to impairment 
losses and mortgage interest expenses of the recently acquired hospitality assets in BSREP III, resulting from the impact of the 
economic shutdown.
Renewable Power
Within our Renewable Power segment, incremental revenues of $294 million and net income of $79 million are primarily due 
to acquisitions of wind and solar assets completed in late 2019.
Infrastructure
Recent acquisitions contributed incremental revenues of $2.7 billion and net income of $111 million. In late 2019, we acquired 
Genesee & Wyoming Inc. (“Genesee & Wyoming”)1, contributing incremental revenues and net income of $2.0 billion and 
$97 million in the current year, respectively. In addition, the recent acquisition of Summit DigiTel in the third quarter of 2020 
and the acquisition of NorthRiver Midstream Inc. (“NorthRiver”)1 in 2019 collectively contributed $541 million of revenues 
and $8 million of net income in the current year, respectively.
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
35    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Private Equity
The current year’s revenues of $4.0 billion and net income of $6 million included impacts from Clarios and Healthscope 
acquired in the second quarter of 2019 and Sagen acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. These three businesses collectively 
contributed $3.7 billion of revenues and $125 million of net income in the current year. The net income was partially offset 
by  the  higher  equity  accounted  current  taxes  and  interest  due  to  the  acquisition  of  Brand  Industrial  Holdings  Inc. 
(“BrandSafway”)1 in the first quarter of 2020, which contributed a net loss of $98 million in the current year.
Further details relating to the significant acquisitions described above that were completed during the year ended December 31, 
2020 are provided in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.
Dispositions
Recent asset sales reduced revenues and net loss by $2.2 billion and $35 million in the current year, respectively. The assets 
sold that most significantly impacted our results were BGIS, BGRS and North American Palladium Ltd. (“NAP”)1, our 
palladium mining operations, in our Private Equity segment.

• updated near- and mid-term cash flow projections, primarily in the U.S. markets, incorporating a decrease in rental growth 
and tenant-specific credit loss assumptions; partially offset by
• a compression of capitalization rates for some of our core office properties in New York and the U.K.;
• development milestones reached for a property in our Toronto portfolio; and
• gains at 100 Bishopsgate in London as the property neared completion.
Valuation gains of $946 million in the prior year were primarily as a result of improved leasing assumptions on development 
properties in the U.K. and U.S. as they neared substantial completion, strong occupancy and compression of terminal 
capitalization rates in our Canadian portfolio to reflect comparable market transactions and rate compression from improved 
rental markets in Australia.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT    36 
Core Retail
Valuation losses of $1.7 billion are mainly attributable to changes to a number of assumptions on a space-by-space basis to 
reflect the impacts of the economic shutdown. We revised valuation metrics where necessary to reflect changes in certain 
property level risk profiles.
Appraisal losses of $683 million in the prior year were due to lower assumed future cash flows on certain consolidated retail 
assets and adjustments to the timing of when those cash flows are received, partially offset by a decrease in capitalization and 
discount rates.
LP Investments and Other
Valuation gains of $1.6 billion relate primarily to: 
• gains on the life science assets at Forest City to reflect recent broker valuations as well as discount rate compression and 
higher leasing at our Shanghai mixed-use property; and
• gains in our Brazil office portfolio, driven by capitalization rate compression to reflect the historically low interest rate 
environment, as well as gains in our U.K. student housing and U.S. manufactured housing portfolios; partially offset by
• updated assumptions on our opportunistic retail assets and office assets to reflect near-term cash flow assumptions as a 
result of the economic shutdown.
In the prior year, valuation gains of $1.4 billion were primarily related to improved market conditions in Brazil and India. In 
addition, a decrease in terminal capitalization rates and higher projected cash flows at our U.K. student housing portfolio as 
well as strong leasing activity in our directly held portfolios contributed to the valuation gains.
Transaction Related Gains, Net of Expenses
Transaction related gains, net of expenses, totaled $20 million for the year. These gains were primarily due to a restructuring 
gain on our Australian coal export terminal business in our Infrastructure segment and a gain from debt restructuring at an 
operating company within our Private Equity segment; partially offset by the early redemption of debt across a number of our 
businesses as well as restructuring costs and transaction costs related to recent acquisitions.
The prior year transaction related expenses of $895 million primarily relate to the acquisition of Oaktree, Clarios, Genesee & 
Wyoming and Aveo Group.
Financial Contracts
Financial contracts include mark-to-market gains and losses on financial contracts related to foreign currency, interest rate and 
pricing exposures that are not designated as hedges.
The gain of $686 million is primarily attributable to gains on our financial contracts in our Private Equity segment and mark-to-
market movements on aforementioned market and currency hedges, partially offset by losses on interest rate and cross-currency 
swaps, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Unrealized losses of $140 million in the prior year primarily relate to mark-to-market movements on our interest rate and cross-
currency swaps and fair value changes on our currency hedges, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Impairment and Provisions
Impairment and provision expense for the year of $808 million are primarily related to the impact of the economic shutdown on 
operating businesses within our Private Equity segment and hospitality assets in our Real Estate segment. Included in this 
balance is the impairment taken on vessels at Altera related to the reassessment of future assumptions surrounding estimated 
salvage values, expected earnings and redeployment opportunities.
Other Fair Value Changes
Other fair value losses of $1.1 billion were reported for the year. These losses were primarily due to unrealized foreign 
exchange losses in our Private Equity segment. Included in this balance are also various other one-time charges across our 
segments.

Income Taxes
We recorded an aggregate income tax expense of $837 million in 2020 (2019 – $495 million), including current tax expenses of 
$756 million (2019 – $970 million) and deferred tax expense of $81 million (2019 – recovery of $475 million). 
The increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributed to minimal tax implications from valuation losses incurred 
in our Real Estate segment, which are subject to lower global tax rates. As a result, the international operations subject to 
different tax rates contributed 52% to the increase of our effective tax rate in 2020.
Our effective income tax rate is different from the Canadian domestic statutory income tax rate due to the following 
differences:

As an asset manager, many of our operations are held in partially-owned “flow-through” entities, such as partnerships, and 
any tax liability is incurred by the investors as opposed to the entity. As a result, while our consolidated earnings include 
income attributable to non-controlling ownership interests in these entities, our consolidated tax provision includes only our 
proportionate share of the associated tax provision of these entities. In other words, we are consolidating all the net income, but 
only our share of the associated tax provision. This reduced our effective tax rate by 31% and 4% in 2020 and 2019, 
respectively. 
Our income tax provision does not include a number of non-income taxes paid that are recorded elsewhere in our consolidated 
financial statements. For example, a number of our operations in Brazil are required to pay non-recoverable taxes on revenue, 
which are included in direct costs as opposed to income taxes. In addition, we pay considerable property, payroll and other 
taxes that represent an important component of the tax base in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which are also 
predominantly recorded in direct costs.

2020 vs. 2019
Total assets were $343.7 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $19.7 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The 
increase is driven by both business combinations and asset acquisitions, which totaled $28.5 billion for the year. Recently 
completed business combinations added $11.0 billion of total assets, whereas asset acquisitions contributed $17.5 billion. Net 
valuation gains recognized on our PP&E during the year also contributed to the increase in total assets. These increases were 
partially offset by assets sold during the year.
We have summarized the impact of business combinations as well as equity accounted investment, investment properties and 
property, plant and equipment additions for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the table below:

1. Includes non-controlling interests recognized on business combinations measured as the proportionate share of fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities on the 
date of acquisition. 
We have summarized below the major contributors to the year-over-year variances for the statement of financial position. 
PP&E increased by $10.7 billion primarily as a result of: 
• acquisitions and net additions during the year contributing $12.9 billion of PP&E; and
• revaluation surplus of $4.8 billion with the majority of the increase attributable to our Renewable Power segment, which 
benefited from lower discount rates, as well as the continued successful implementation of cost saving and revenue 
enhancing initiatives;  partially offset by
• depreciation of $4.5 billion in the year; and
• the deconsolidation of a hospitality investment and other businesses, which reduced PP&E by $1.8 billion.
We provide a continuity of PP&E in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.
Investment properties consist primarily of the company’s real estate assets. The balance as at December 31, 2020 remained 
consistent compared to the prior year after accounting for the following:
• additions of $8.2 billion, mainly through enhancement or expansion of properties through capital expenditures and the 
purchase of investment properties during the year; and
• the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $984 million; offset by
• asset sales, including a self-storage portfolio and a core office asset in London, as well as reclassifications to assets held 
for sale for a total of $9.3 billion; and
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    40 
• net valuation losses of $269 million, driven by revaluations of our retail and office portfolios.
We provide a continuity of investment properties in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.
Equity accounted investments increased by $629 million to $41.3 billion in the current year, mainly due to:
• net additions of $2.6 billion, including the $1.3 billion acquisition of an interest in BrandSafway in our Private Equity 
segment in the first quarter of the year, as well as the acquisition of a $1.3 billion interest in Cheniere Energy Partners, 
L.P. (“Cheniere”)1 in our Infrastructure segment in the third quarter; and
• our proportionate share of the comprehensive income reported; partially offset by
• the reclassification of $1.3 billion of interest in Norbord to held for sale; and
• distributions and return of capital received of $1.4 billion.
We provide a continuity of equity accounted investments in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.2 billion as at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year end primarily due to 
net proceeds from corporate debt issuances, the secondary offerings of BEP units, BEPC and BIPC shares, as well as cash 
received from asset sales, partially offset by cash used in business combinations completed during the year. For further 
information, refer to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and to the Review of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
within Part 4 – Capitalization and Liquidity. 
Intangible assets decreased by $3.1 billion due to the impact of foreign currency translation and amortization, partially offset by 
additions from acquisitions in our Infrastructure segment. Goodwill increased by $164 million due to the acquisition of new 
businesses and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by the sale of the pathology business at Healthscope. 
Other assets are comprised of inventory, deferred income tax assets, assets classified as held for sale and other financial assets. 
The increase of $7.5 billion is primarily a result of: 
• an increase in other financial assets of $5.3 billion, primarily due to strategic investments acquired within our Real Estate, 
Infrastructure and Private Equity segments and opportunistic financial asset positions entered into during the year; and
• an increase in assets held for sale of $2.4 billion, primarily attributable to the reclassification of three mall assets, four 
triple net lease assets in the U.S. and an office asset in Australia within our Real Estate segment as well as our equity 
investment in Norbord, partially offset by the sale of Genesee & Wyoming’s Australian assets and a Colombian regulated 
distribution operation, within our Infrastructure segment.
Corporate borrowings increased by $2.0 billion due to issuances of a $600 million 30-year note, a $750 million 10-year note, a 
$500 million 31-year note and a $400 million 60-year note during the year. These were partially offset by a repayment of 
a $251 million (C$350 million) note in the first quarter.
Non-recourse borrowings of managed entities increased by $3.0 billion as a result of:
• an increase in subsidiary borrowings across the businesses, as they took advantage of the low interest rate environment to 
strengthen liquidity; and
• an increase in property-specific borrowings, mainly as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions.
Other non-current financial liabilities consist of our subsidiary equity obligations, non-current accounts payable and other  
long-term financial liabilities that are due after one year. Non-current accounts payable and other increased by $4.5 billion, 
primarily due to the aforementioned acquisitions as well as an increase in lease obligations in our Real Estate segment. Please 
see Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. 
The increase of other liabilities of $4.4 billion is primarily attributable to an increase in financial liabilities associated with 
hedges in our Infrastructure segment as well as liabilities associated with assets held for sale in our Real Estate segment. Please 
see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Refer to Part 4 – Capitalization and Liquidity for more information.

41    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
2019 vs. 2018
Consolidated assets as at December 31, 2019 were $324.0 billion, compared to $256.3 billion as at December 31, 2018. Year-
over-year increases were primarily due to business combinations and asset acquisitions completed in 2019. Our acquisition of 
Oaktree further increased the assets in our equity accounted investment. The adoption of IFRS 16 increased our property, plant 
and equipment and investment properties through the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets. These increases were 
partially offset by assets sold in 2019.
Investment properties were $12.4 billion higher at the end of 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the impact of various real 
estate investments completed in 2019, in particular our acquisition of Aveo Group. The adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019 resulted 
in the recognition of ROU investment properties, primarily land leases on which some of our investment properties are built. In 
addition, the impact of capital expenditures and valuation gains were partially offset by losses in our core retail portfolio and 
numerous asset sales across our core office and LP investments portfolios.
Property, plant and equipment increased by $22.0 billion during 2019. The increase was primarily a result of acquisitions 
completed across our operating segments during the year and revaluation gains largely in our Renewable Power segment. The 
increase was also due to the recognition of property, plant and equipment ROU assets upon adopting IFRS 16 in 2019. These 
increases were partially offset by dispositions and reclassification to assets held for sale as well as depreciation recorded during 
the year. 
Equity accounted investments were $40.7 billion as at December 31, 2019, an increase of $7.1 billion compared to 2018. The 
increase was mainly due to $9.1 billion of additions across multiple businesses, including the acquisition of interest 
in Oaktree and the equity accounted investments assumed within the acquisition of Clarios in our Private Equity segment. In 
addition, the increase from our share of comprehensive income from equity accounted investments was partially offset by the 
aforementioned step-up to a controlling interest of a portfolio of retail malls in our Real Estate segment as well as dispositions 
and reclassifications to held for sale.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.6 billion as at December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the impact of 
cash used in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and the timing of recent asset sales and debt refinancings. 
Intangible assets and goodwill increased by $8.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, due to the acquisitions completed in our 
Private  Equity  and  Infrastructure  segments  in  2019,  partially  offset  by  the  impact  of  amortization,  impairment  and 
foreign exchange.
Other assets increased by $11.7 billion as a result of acquisitions completed in our Private Equity segment, including the 
increase in inventory and other financial assets, as well as additions and appreciation of our existing financial asset portfolios. 
In addition, the increase was due to reclassifying certain assets in our Infrastructure segment to assets held for sale; partially 
offset by the sale of assets in our Real Estate and Renewable Power segments.
Corporate borrowings increased by $674 million as the issuance of $1.0 billion 10-year note as well as the impact of 
strengthened foreign exchange rates during 2019 were partially offset by a repayment of a $450 million (C$600 million) note.
Non-recourse borrowings increased by $24.5 billion in 2019 as result of increased borrowings to finance acquisitions, including 
our acquisition of Genesee & Wyoming in our Infrastructure segment, Aveo Group in our Real Estate segment, Clarios, 
Healthscope and the Brazilian heavy equipment and light vehicle fleet management company in our Private Equity segment. 
These increases were partially offset by the partial repayment of credit facilities within our Real Estate segment as well as 
dispositions and reclassification of businesses to held for sale.
Other non-current financial liabilities increased by $10.5 billion in 2019 primarily due to the recognition of non-current lease 
liabilities on adoption of IFRS 16, aforementioned acquisitions, higher insurance liabilities within our annuities business and a 
higher stock compensation liability due to share price appreciation. 
Other liabilities increased by $12.4 billion primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in 2019, including deferred income tax 
liabilities recorded in business combinations, and current lease liabilities recognized on adoption of IFRS 16 in 2019.

Common equity increased by $825 million to $31.7 billion during the year. The change includes:
• net loss attributable to shareholders of $134 million;
• distributions of $867 million to shareholders as common and preferred share dividends; 
• other comprehensive income of $818 million as a result of:
◦ revaluation  gains  of  $1.0  billion  primarily  attributable  to  valuation  gains  within  our  renewable  power  and 
infrastructure groups, partially offset by additional deferred income taxes reserved against these gains; and
◦ other OCI gains of $145 million from mark-to-market movement on cash flow hedges held in our real estate, 
infrastructure and private equity segments; partially offset by
◦ foreign currency translation loss, net of hedges, of $332 million as a result of our unhedged exposure mainly on the 
Brazilian real and Colombian peso. Refer to Foreign Currency Translation on pages 45 and 46;
• share repurchases, net of issuances, of $270 million, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately 8.9 million 
common shares through the NCIB program; and
• ownership changes and other of $1.3 billion primarily related to:
◦ gains on BPY units acquired at a discount to book value as part of purchases made through their substantial issuer bid 
as well as the normal course issuer bid program;
◦ dilution  gain  from  the  issuance  of  BEPC  shares  in  conjunction  with  the  TerraForm  Power,  Inc.  (“TERP”)1 
privatization; and
◦ gains recognized on partial sell-down of businesses at values above IFRS book value, primarily related to the block 
sale of GrafTech International Ltd. (“GrafTech”)1 as well as the secondary offering of BEP units, BEPC shares and 
BIPC shares; partially offset by
◦ the impact of a partial sell-down of our interest in AVN (our Chilean toll road) in the first quarter, and an accretion 
loss on the privatization of Altera, a global service provider to the offshore oil production industry.

Non-controlling interests increased by $5.0 billion during the year, primarily due to:
• equity issuances to non-controlling interests totaling $12.7 billion;
• comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests which totaled $2.3 billion, including $3.4 billion of 
revaluation surplus less $1.0 billion of foreign currency translation losses; partially offset by
• $6.5 billion of distributions to non-controlling interests; and
 
• ownership changes decreased amounts attributable to non-controlling interests by $3.6 billion.
CONSOLIDATION AND FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING
As a Canadian domiciled public corporation, we report under IFRS, while many of our alternative asset manager peers report 
under U.S. GAAP. There are many differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, but the two principal differences affecting our 
consolidated financial statements compared to those of our peers are consolidation and fair value accounting.
In particular, U.S. GAAP allows some of our alternative asset manager peers to report certain investments, which qualify as 
variable interest entities, at fair value on one line in their balance sheet on a net basis as opposed to consolidating the funds. 
This approach is not available under IFRS. This can create significant differences in the presentation of our financial statements 
as compared to our alternative asset manager peers.
Consolidation
Our consolidation conclusions under IFRS may differ from our peers who report under U.S. GAAP for two primary reasons:
• U.S. GAAP uses a voting interest model or a variable interest model to determine consolidation requirements, depending 
on the circumstances, whereas IFRS uses a control-based model. We generally have the contractual ability to unilaterally 
direct the relevant activities of our funds; and 
• we generally invest significant amounts of capital alongside our investors and partners, which, in addition to our 
customary management fees and incentive fees, means that we earn meaningful returns as a principal investor in addition 
to our asset management returns compared to a manager who acts solely as an agent.
As a result, in many cases, we control entities in which we hold only a minority economic interest. For example, a Brookfield-
sponsored private fund to which we have committed 30% of the capital may acquire 60% of the voting interest in an investee 
company. The contractual arrangements generally provide us with the irrevocable ability to direct the funds’ activities. Based 
on these facts, we would control the investment because we exercise decision-making power over a controlling interest of that 
business and our 18% economic interest provides us with exposure to the variable returns of a principal. 
All entities that we control are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we include 100% of these entities’ 
revenues and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, even though a substantial portion of their net income is 
attributable  to  non-controlling  interests.  Furthermore,  we  include  all  of  the  assets,  liabilities,  including  non-recourse 
borrowings, of these entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and include the portion of equity held by others as non-
controlling interests.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    44 
Intercompany revenues and expenses between Brookfield and its subsidiaries, such as asset management fees, are eliminated in 
our Consolidated Statements of Operations; however, these items affect the attribution of net income between shareholders and 
non-controlling interests. For example, asset management fees paid by our listed affiliates to the Corporation are eliminated 
from consolidated revenues and expenses. However, as the common shareholders are attributed all of the fee revenues1 while 
only attributed their proportionate share of the listed affiliates’ expenses, the amount of net income attributable to common 
shareholders is increased with a corresponding decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interests.
Fair Value Accounting
Under U.S. GAAP, many of our alternative asset manager peers account for their funds as investment companies and reflect 
their investments at fair value. 
Under IFRS, as a parent company, we are required to look through our consolidated and equity accounted investments and 
account for their assets and liabilities under the applicable IFRS guidance. We reflect a large number of assets at fair value, 
namely our commercial properties, renewable power facilities and certain infrastructure assets which are typically recorded at 
amortized cost under U.S. GAAP. However, there are other assets that are not subject to fair value accounting under IFRS and 
are therefore carried at amortized cost, which would be more consistent with U.S. GAAP. 
Under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP, the value of asset management activities is generally not reflected on the balance sheet 
despite being material components of the value of these businesses.
For additional details on the valuation approach for the relevant segments, critical assumptions and related sensitivities, refer to 
Part 5 of this MD&A.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Approximately half of our capital is invested in non-U.S. currencies and the cash flows generated from these businesses, 
as well as our equity, are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we utilize financial 
contracts to adjust these exposures. The most significant currency exchange rates that impact our business are shown in the 
following table:

1. Using Brazilian real and Colombian peso as the price currency.
As at December 31, 2020, our common equity of $31.7 billion was invested in the following currencies: U.S. dollars – 58% 
(2019 – 54%); Brazilian reais – 8% (2019 – 12%); British pounds – 12% (2019 – 13%); Canadian dollars – 7% (2019 – 8%); 
Australian dollars – 7% (2019 – 6%); Colombian pesos – 2% (2019 – 2%); and other currencies – 6% (2019 – 5%). Currency 
exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at the end of 2020 were higher than December 31, 2019 for all of our significant non-
U.S. dollar investments with the exception of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso.

1. Net of deferred income tax expense of $37 million (2019 – $8 million).
The foreign currency translation of our equity, net of currency hedges, for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated a loss 
of $1.3 billion. This was primarily attributable to lower period end and average rates for the Brazilian real and the Colombian 
peso, partially offset by gains on the higher period end rates for our investments in the Australian dollar, British pound, 
Canadian dollar and Euro.
We seek to hedge foreign currency exposure where the cost of doing so is reasonable. Due to the high historical costs 
associated with hedging Brazilian real, Colombian peso and other emerging market currencies, hedge levels against those 
currencies were low at year end.

47    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS
The quarterly variances in revenues over the past two years are due primarily to acquisitions and dispositions. Variances in net 
income to shareholders relate primarily to the timing and amount of non-cash fair value changes and deferred tax provisions, as 
well as seasonality and cyclical influences in certain businesses. Changes in ownership have resulted in the consolidation and 
deconsolidation of revenues from some of our assets, particularly in our real estate and private equity businesses. Other factors 
include the impact of foreign currency on non-U.S. revenues, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and the 
global economic shutdown. 
Our real estate operations typically generate consistent results on a quarterly basis due to the long-term nature of contractual 
lease arrangements subject to the intermittent recognition of disposition and lease termination gains. Our retail properties 
typically experience seasonally higher retail sales during the fourth quarter, and our resort hotels tend to experience higher 
revenues and costs as a result of increased visits during the first quarter. We fair value our real estate assets on a quarterly basis 
which results in variations in net income based on changes in the value.
Renewable power hydroelectric operations are seasonal in nature. Generation tends to be higher during the winter rainy season 
in Brazil and spring thaws in North America; however, this is mitigated to an extent by prices, which tend not to be as strong as 
they are in the summer and winter seasons due to the more moderate weather conditions and reductions in demand for 
electricity. Water and wind conditions may also vary from year to year. Our infrastructure operations are generally stable in 
nature as a result of regulation or long-term sales contracts with our investors, certain of which guarantee minimum volumes. 
Revenues and direct costs in our private equity operations vary from quarter to quarter primarily due to acquisitions and 
dispositions of businesses, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, business and economic cycles, and weather and seasonality in 
underlying operations. Broader economic factors and commodity market volatility may have a significant impact on a number 
of our businesses, in particular within our industrials portfolio. For example, seasonality affects our contract drilling and well-
servicing operations as the ability to move heavy equipment safely and efficiently in western Canadian oil and gas fields is 
dependent on weather conditions. Within our infrastructure services, the core operating plants business of our service provider 
to the power generation industry generates the majority of its revenue during the fall and spring, when power plants go offline 
to perform maintenance and replenish their fuel. Some of our business services operations will typically have stronger 
performance in the latter half of the year whereas others, such as our fuel marketing and road fuel distribution businesses, will 
generate stronger performance in the second and third quarters. Net income is impacted by periodic gains and losses on 
acquisitions, monetization and impairments.
Our residential development operations are seasonal in nature and a large portion is correlated with the North America housing 
market and, to a lesser extent, economic conditions in Brazil. Results in these businesses are typically higher in the third and 
fourth quarters compared to the first half of the year, as weather conditions are more favorable in the latter half of the year 
which tends to increase construction activity levels.
Our condensed statements of operations for the eight most recent quarters are as follows:

Over the last eight completed quarters, the factors discussed below caused variations in revenues and net income to 
shareholders on a quarterly basis:
• In the fourth quarter of 2020, revenues increased in comparison to the prior quarter due to same-store1 growth in most of 
our businesses. The higher net income in the quarter is a result of gains from asset sales in the quarter as well as a positive 
contribution from our equity accounted investments and fair value changes.
• In the third quarter of 2020, revenues increased relative to the prior quarter due to increased contributions from recent 
acquisitions across our operating segments. We had net income in the quarter, relative to the prior quarter’s net loss, as a 
result of improved performance across many of our businesses and a positive contribution from fair value changes 
stemming from consolidated investment properties, particularly within our BSREP III fund.
• In the second quarter of 2020, revenues decreased in comparison to the prior quarter due to the impact of the economic 
shutdown for a large part of the quarter. The higher net loss in the quarter is primarily attributed to a decline in 
the valuation of our investment property portfolio as cash flow assumptions were adjusted downwards to reflect the impact 
of the shutdown.
• In the first quarter of 2020, revenues decreased compared to the prior quarter primarily due to lower same-store growth as 
a result of seasonality and the impact of the economic shutdown. Contributions from acquisitions across our operating 
segments were partially offset by recent asset sales from our Private Equity and Renewable Power segments. Net income 
also decreased due to unrealized fair value changes brought about by the current environment.
• In the fourth quarter of 2019, revenues remained consistent with the prior quarter as we continued to benefit from 
contributions from recently acquired businesses and strong same-store growth across our operating segments. Net income 
decreased primarily due to lower fair value gains and the absence of a deferred tax recovery, partially offset by an increase 
in equity accounted income. 
• In the third quarter of 2019, revenues increased from a full quarter contribution from Clarios and Healthscope, which we 
acquired in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, net income increased from the prior quarter due to the recognition of 
deferred income tax recoveries and valuation gains in our core office and LP investment properties.
• In the second quarter of 2019, revenues increased due to recent acquisitions across a number of segments, in particular 
industrials and infrastructure services in the Private Equity segment. The increase in revenue was offset by higher direct 
operating costs, interest expense from incremental borrowing, as well as valuation losses on some of our core retail 
properties and our service provider to the offshore oil production industry in the Private Equity segment. 
• In the first quarter of 2019, revenues decreased slightly from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonality at our 
residential homebuilding business and certain of our private equity operations as well as a decrease in sales volumes at 
our road fuel distribution business. In addition, the absence of a deferred tax recovery in our Corporate segment, as well as 
higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to the impact of revaluation gains reported in the fourth quarter 
contributed to the decrease in net income.

PART 3 – OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
How We Measure and Report Our Operating Segments
Our operations are organized into our asset management business, five operating groups and our corporate activities, which 
collectively  represent  seven  operating  segments  for  internal  and  external  reporting  purposes.  We  measure  operating 
performance primarily using FFO generated by each operating segment and the amount of capital invested by the Corporation 
in each segment using common equity. Common equity relates to invested capital allocated to a particular business segment 
which  we  use  interchangeably  with  segment  common  equity.  To  further  assess  operating  performance  for  our  Asset 
Management segment, we also provide unrealized carried interest1 which represents carried interest generated on unrealized 
changes in value within our private fund investment portfolios.
Our operating segments are global in scope and are as follows:
i. Asset management operations include managing our long-term private funds, perpetual strategies and public securities on 
behalf of our investors and ourselves, as well as our share of the asset management activities of Oaktree. We generate 
contractual base management fees for these activities as well as incentive distributions and performance income, including 
performance fees, transaction fees and carried interest.   
ii. Real estate operations include the ownership, operation and development of core office, core retail, LP investments and 
other properties. 
iii. Renewable power operations include the ownership, operation and development of hydroelectric, wind, solar and energy 
transition power generating facilities. 
iv. Infrastructure operations include the ownership, operation and development of utilities, transport, midstream, data and 
sustainable resource assets. 
v. Private equity operations include a broad range of industries, and are mostly focused on business services, infrastructure 
services and industrials. 
vi. Residential development operations consist of homebuilding, condominium development and land development. 
vii. Corporate activities include the investment of cash and financial assets, as well as the management of our corporate 
leverage, including corporate borrowings and preferred equity, which fund a portion of the capital invested in our other 
operations. Certain corporate costs such as technology and operations are incurred on behalf of our operating segments and 
allocated to each operating segment based on an internal pricing framework. 
In assessing results, we separately identify the portion of FFO and common equity within our segments that relate to our 
primary listed affiliates. We believe that identifying the FFO and common equity attributable to our listed affiliates enables 
investors to understand how the results of these public entities are integrated into our financial results and is helpful in 
analyzing variances in FFO between reporting periods. Additional information with respect to these listed affiliates is available 
in their public filings. We also separately identify the components of our asset management FFO and realized disposition gains1 
included within the FFO of each segment in order to facilitate analysis of variances in FFO between reporting periods.

Total revenues and FFO were $66.7 billion and $5.2 billion in the current year compared to $70.6 billion and $4.2 billion in the 
prior year, respectively. FFO includes realized disposition gains of $1.6 billion in 2020, compared to $882 million in the prior 
year. Excluding disposition gains, FFO increased by $321 million from the prior year.
Revenues decreased primarily as a result of the impact of the global economic shutdown, particularly within our Real Estate, 
Private Equity and Residential Development segments, as well as the absence of contribution from assets sold during the year. 
These decreases were partially offset by our acquisition of an interest in Oaktree during the third quarter of 2019, as well as 
recent acquisitions within our Private Equity and Infrastructure segments.
The increase in FFO, excluding disposition gains, is primarily a result of:
• increased fee-related earnings1 in our Asset Management segment from fees earned on higher market capitalization across 
our listed affiliates and increases in our private fund capital as well as contributions from Oaktree;
• improved same-store results at Norbord, one of the world’s largest producers of OSB, which benefited from strong product 
pricing and volume during the year;
• contributions from our financial assets portfolio, benefiting from higher realized and unrealized gains in the current year; 
and
• contributions from recent acquisitions, net of the impact of asset sales; partially offset by
• lower income from our core retail portfolio and hospitality assets due to higher credit loss reserves, temporary tenants and 
lower occupancy; and
• the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
We recognized $1.6 billion of disposition gains during the year which mainly consisted of gains on secondary offerings of 
units/shares in BEP, BEPC and BIPC. Further gains were recognized from the sale of real estate assets within our Fairfield 
portfolio and our One London Wall place building in our Real Estate segment, as well as the continued sales of shares of 
GrafTech in our Private Equity segment.
Common equity increased by $825 million to $31.7 billion primarily from comprehensive income recognized during the year, 
an accretion gain from the purchase of BPY units at a discount to book value, as well as gains on the issuance of BEPC shares, 
as part of the TERP privatization, and the secondary offering of BEPC shares. Additional contributors to the increase include 
gains on our partial sale of BEP units and the secondary offering of BIPC shares. The aforementioned contributions were 
partially offset by dividends paid and the impact of share buybacks.

Business Overview
• We manage $312 billion of fee-bearing capital, including $84 billion in long-term private funds, $94 billion in perpetual 
strategies, $121 billion in credit strategies and $13 billion within our public securities group. We earn recurring long-term 
fee revenues from this fee-bearing capital, in the form of:
◦ Long-term, diversified base management fee revenues from third party capital in our closed-end and perpetual private 
funds and perpetual fee revenues based on the total capitalization of our listed affiliates;
◦ Incentive distributions from BIP, BEP and BPY, all of which have exceeded pre-determined thresholds; and
◦ Performance fees, linked to the unit price performance of BBU and other transaction and advisory fees.
• Included within our private fund fee-bearing capital is $140 billion of carry eligible capital. We earn carried interest from 
this capital when fund performance achieves its preferred return, allowing us to receive a portion of fund profits returned 
to investors. We recognize this carried interest when a fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of preferred returns and 
when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT    52 
Five-Year Review
Our long-term private funds and co-investments have grown considerably, almost doubling in size over the last five years. In 
addition, the capitalization of our listed affiliates has grown as a result of higher unit/share prices and increased capital markets 
activity. These factors have contributed to higher base fees and incentive distributions and a corresponding increase in asset 
management FFO. The result has been a 26% and 22% cumulative annual growth rate in fee-bearing capital and total fee-
related earnings over the last five years.
Our accumulated unrealized carried interest has increased each of the past five years due to the growth in our fund sizes and 
addition of new strategies and the strong investment performance. As our private fund business has grown and diversified, the 
nature of our carried interest has as well. We expect to recognize an increasing amount of realized carried interest into FFO and 
net income as our earlier vintage funds continue to monetize investments and return significant capital to investors.
Outlook and Growth Initiatives
Alternative assets provide an attractive investment opportunity to institutional and high net worth investors. In periods when 
global interest rates are lower than they have ever been, alternatives continue to be an attractive investment as they have 
demonstrated the ability to provide attractive risk adjusted returns and retain their value across cycles. These asset classes also 
provide investors with alternatives to fixed income investments by providing a strong, inflation protected return profile. 
Institutional investors, in particular pension funds, must earn and generate returns to meet their long-term obligations while 
protecting their capital. As a result, inflows to alternative asset managers are continuing to grow and managers are focused on 
new product development to meet this demand. 
Our business model has proven to be resilient through economic cycles, due to our strong foundation and discipline. Overall, 
our business is stronger and more diversified than ever and well positioned to deliver continued growth.
Looking forward, our business plan remains essentially unchanged. Early this year, we surpassed our target of $50 billion 
raised in the latest round of flagship fundraising and we have now set the objective of targeting $100 billion for the next round 
of flagship funds. We held our first close on our flagship distressed debt fund in Oaktree for $13 billion in 2020, and continue 
to raise capital for the fund. We also recently launched our fourth flagship real estate fund, as well as our inaugural Global 
Transition fund. The Global Transition fund will invest with the dual objectives of earning an attractive financial return and 
generating a measurable positive environmental change. Our two remaining flagship funds should launch over the next twelve 
months.
In addition to our flagship funds, we are progressing a number of newer strategies, including our reinsurance business, 
secondaries business and growing our investing expertise in technology. These new initiatives, in addition to our five flagship 
strategies, are expected to have a very meaningful impact on our growth trajectory in the long term.
We continue to expand our investor base through existing relationships and new channels. As of the final close of our latest 
flagship funds in early 2020, and with the addition of Oaktree in 2019, we have approximately 2,000 investors. With respect to 
our investor base, our high net worth channel continues to grow and accounts for nearly 10% of current commitments. While 
the geographical split of capital raised across all channels has remained largely consistent with the prior year, our commitments 
from Asia as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa continue to increase.
Operations
Long-Term Private Funds ($84 billion of fee-bearing capital)
• We  manage  our  fee-bearing  capital  through  42  active  private  funds  across  our  major  asset  classes:  real  estate, 
infrastructure, renewable power and private equity. These funds include core, credit, value-add and opportunistic closed-
end funds which are primarily invested in the equity of private companies, although in certain cases, are invested in 
publicly traded equities. Our credit strategies invest in debt of companies in our areas of focus.
• We refer to our largest private fund series as our flagship funds. We have flagship funds within each of our major asset 
classes: Real Estate (BSREP series), Infrastructure (BIF series, which includes infrastructure and Renewable Power 
investments), Private Equity (BCP series), Distressed Debt and Global Transition.
• Closed-end private fund capital is typically committed for 10 years from the inception of the fund with two one-year 
extension options. 
• We are compensated for managing these private funds through base management fees, which are generally determined on 
committed capital during the investment period and invested capital thereafter. We are entitled to receive carried interest 
on these funds, which represents a portion of fund profits above a preferred return to investors. 
53    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Perpetual Strategies ($94 billion of fee-bearing capital)
• We manage fee-bearing capital through publicly listed perpetual capital entities, including BPY, BEP, BIP, and BBU, 
along with core, core plus and credit perpetual private funds.
• Perpetual private funds are able to continually raise capital as new investments arise.
• We are compensated for managing these entities through (i) base management fees, which are primarily determined by the 
market capitalization or NAV of these entities and funds; and (ii) incentive distributions or performance fees.
• Incentive distributions for BPY, BEP and BIP are a portion of the increases in distributions above predetermined hurdles. 
Performance fees for BBU are based on increases in the unit price of BBU above an escalating threshold.
Credit Strategies ($121 billion of fee-bearing capital)
• Oaktree operates and manages their respective investment business, earning management fees on fee-bearing capital 
within their long-term closed-end, open-end and evergreen funds.
• Long-term private funds, which have an investment period generally ranging from three to five years from inception of the 
fund, typically pay management fees based on committed capital, drawn capital, gross assets, NAV or cost basis during 
the investment period. 
• Perpetual strategies, which include open-end funds that do not have an investment period and do not distribute proceeds of 
realized investments to clients, and evergreen funds, which invests in marketable securities, private debt and equity on a 
long or short-term basis, generally without distributing proceeds of realized investments to clients. Perpetual strategies 
typically pay management fees based on NAV.
Public Strategies ($13 billion of fee-bearing capital)
• We manage our fee-bearing capital through numerous funds and separately managed accounts, focused on fixed income 
and equity securities. 
• We act as advisor and sub-advisor, earning both base and performance fees.

Long-term private fund fee-bearing capital decreased by $2.1 billion due to:
• $0.7 billion of distributions; and
• $7.0 billion of other decreases, primarily related to uninvested capital in our funds that ended their investment periods 
during the year. This capital has predominantly been earmarked for follow-on investments and will become fee-earning 
again once it is deployed; partially offset by
• $5.7 billion of inflows, including $3.3 billion of co-investment capital, $1.5 billion from our latest flagship infrastructure 
fund, $0.3 billion within our renewable energy strategies, $0.2 billion from our second infrastructure debt fund, and 
$0.4 billion of additional capital across numerous other strategies.
Perpetual strategies fee-bearing capital increased by $15.4 billion since the prior year, due to:
• $16.7 billion price appreciation across our listed affiliates;
• $4.8 billion of inflows primarily related to capital market transactions at BEP, BPY and BIP, as well as capital deployed 
across our core and core plus perpetual funds; partially offset by
• $4.5 billion of distributions, including quarterly distributions paid to the investors of our listed affiliates; and
• $1.6 billion of other decreases, primarily from the decrease in third-party capital as a result of the TERP privatization in 
the third quarter of 2020.
Credit strategies fee-bearing capital increased by $10.7 billion, due to:
• $18.1 billion of capital fundraising and deployment across various strategies;
• $3.2 billion of market valuation increases, reflecting the positive fair value increases in funds whose management fees are 
based on the net asset values of the funds; partially offset by
• $6.1 billion of outflows within open-end and evergreen funds, as well as $1.5 billion of distributions within closed-end 
funds; and
• $3.1 billion of other decreases, primarily related to a decrease in the fee-bearing capital managed by an affiliate of Oaktree.
Public securities capital decreased by $2.1 billion, due to:
• $3.7 billion of redemptions, primarily within our real estate and natural resources public funds and separately managed 
accounts; and
• $2.2 billion of decreases in market valuations, which began to recover in the fourth quarter; partially offset by
• $3.8 billion of fund inflows.
We have approximately $33 billion of additional committed capital that does not currently earn fees but will generate fees once 
deployed.
55    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Carry Eligible Capital
Carry  eligible  capital1  increased  $19.8  billion  during  the  year  to  $139.6  billion  as  at  December  31,  2020  (2019  –
$119.8 billion). The increase was primarily related to capital raised in our latest distressed debt fund, as well as additional 
capital raised in other credit strategies, our latest flagship infrastructure fund and perpetual private funds. This increase was 
partially offset by uninvested capital in three of our flagship funds that ended their investment period during the year. This 
capital is earmarked for follow-on investments and will become carry eligible again once it is invested.
As at December 31, 2020, $90.8 billion of carry eligible capital was deployed (2019 – $72.2 billion). This capital is either 
currently earning carried interest or will begin earning carried interest once its related funds have reached their preferred return 
threshold. There are currently $48.8 billion of uncalled fund commitments that will begin to earn carried interest once the 
capital is deployed and fund preferred returns are met (2019 – $47.6 billion).
Operating Results
Asset management FFO includes fee-related earnings and realized carried interest1 earned in respect of capital managed for our 
investors. Fee-related earnings include fees earned on the capital invested by us in the listed affiliates. This is representative of 
how we manage the business and measure the returns from our asset management activities.
To facilitate analysis, the following table disaggregates our Asset Management segment revenues and FFO into fee-related 
earnings and realized carried interest, net1, as these are the measures that we use to analyze the performance of the Asset 
Management segment. We also analyze unrealized carried interest, net, to provide insight into the value our investments have 
created in the period.
We have provided additional detail, where referenced, to explain significant variances from the prior year.

1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
Fee-related earnings increased by $227 million at our share, primarily due to higher base management fees and incentive 
distributions earned during the year. This was partially offset by increased direct costs and lower transaction and advisory fees.
Base management fees increased by $801 million to $2.5 billion, a 47% increase from 2019. The increase is broken down as 
follows:
• $700 million, or $432 million at our share, increase in fee revenues from our credit strategy, due to the inclusion of a full 
year of Oaktree’s management fees, following the acquisition in September 2019;
• $99 million increase in perpetual strategies, as a result of increased market capitalizations at BEP and BIP, capital market 
transactions across the listed affiliates, and additional capital raised and deployed in our perpetual private fund strategies; 
and
• $30 million increase in long-term private fund fees, primarily due to additional fees from third-party commitments raised 
within our latest flagship infrastructure and private equity funds; partially offset by
• $28 million decrease in our public securities fees due to a decrease in fee-bearing capital, predominantly in our mutual 
fund strategies.
Incentive distributions from BIP, BEP and BPY increased by $44 million to $306 million, a 17% increase from 2019. The 
growth represents our share as manager of increases in per unit distributions by BIP, BEP and BPY.
Direct costs consist primarily of employee expenses and professional fees, as well as business related technology costs and 
other shared services. Excluding Oaktree, direct costs increased $53 million or 8% from the prior year quarter as we continue to 
build out the franchise to support new strategies, and launch the next round of flagship funds, while enhancing our client 
service.
The margin on our fee-related earnings, including our share of Oaktree’s fee-related earnings, was 57% in the current year 
(2019  –  62%).  Our  fee-related  earnings  margin,  including  100%  of  Oaktree’s  fee-related  earnings,  was  54%  in  the 
current year (2019 – 61%), with the decrease attributable to the inclusion of a year of Oaktree at a lower margin. The Brookfield 
margin on a standalone basis was 64% for the year, consistent with the prior period.
ii.  Realized Carried Interest
We realize carried interest when a fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of preferred returns and when it is highly probable 
that a significant reversal will not occur. During the year, we realized $348 million of carried interest, net of direct costs (2019 
– $396 million). Realizations during the year were mainly attributable to realizations within our credit platform, fourth flagship 
private equity fund, first real estate flagship fund, multifamily funds and Colombian infrastructure fund.
We  provide  supplemental  information  and  analysis  below  on  the  estimated  amount  of  unrealized  carried  interest 
(see section iii) that has accumulated based on fund performance up to the date of the consolidated financial statements.

1. Represents the amounts, at 100%, assumed on the acquisition of Oaktree. 
Unrealized carried interest generated in the current year before foreign exchange and associated costs was $1.2 billion, 
primarily related to higher valuations within our credit and flagship funds.
Accumulated  unrealized  carried  interest,  at  our  share,  totaled  $4.0  billion  at  December  31,  2020.  We  estimate  that 
approximately $1.4 billion of associated costs will arise on the realization of the amounts accumulated to date, predominantly 
related to employee long-term incentive plans and taxes. We expect to recognize $2.5 billion of this carry, before costs, within 
the next three years; however, realization of this carried interest is dependent on future investment performance and the timing 
of monetizations.

Our real estate group remains focused on increasing the value of our properties through proactive leasing and select 
redevelopment initiatives, as well as recycling capital from mature properties, primarily core office assets, to fund new higher 
yielding investments, particularly in our LP investments real estate business. Our $4.4 billion capital backlog gives us the 
opportunity to deploy additional capital throughout our portfolio for planned capital expansion that should continue to increase 
earnings for the next several years as these projects are completed. Our development track record reflects on-time and on-
budget completions. This includes development projects in progress across our premier office buildings, retail malls and mixed-
use complexes located primarily in North America and Europe. 
In our core retail operations, we are focused on operating and developing high-quality shopping centers as these destinations 
continue to provide an attractive physical location for retailers and continue to demonstrate meaningful outperformance, 
relative to lower tier malls, despite a changing retail landscape. 
In our LP investments operations, we will continue to acquire high-quality properties through our global opportunistic private 
funds as these generally produce higher returns relative to core strategies. These funds have a wide scope in terms of real estate 
asset classes and geographic reach. We target to earn opportunistic returns in our portfolio. These investments have a defined 
hold period and typically generate the majority of profits from gains recognized from realization events, including the sale of an 
asset or portfolio of assets, or exit of the entire investment. Funding for these transactions will continue to include proceeds 
from asset sales as part of our capital recycling program.

“Economic ownership interest” in the Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
Revenues from our real estate operations decreased by $1.6 billion as the benefits from acquisitions were more than offset by 
the decrease in revenue from closures related to the economic shutdown, lower occupancy rates in our hospitality assets, a 
decrease in parking income and lease expirations in our core office portfolio. We also saw lower occupancy rates, abatements 
and tenant bankruptcies as a result of the economic slowdown in our core retail business. FFO prior to realized disposition 
gains decreased by $298 million primarily due to the aforementioned reasons, as well as lower same-store net operating income 
from certain retail tenants in our core office portfolio, partially offset by lower interest expense during the year and our 
increased ownership in BPY.

1. Reflects preferred dividend distributions as well as fee-related earnings, net carried interest and associated asset management expenses not included in FFO reclassified 
to the Asset Management segment.
BPY’s FFO for the year was $815 million, of which our share was $413 million, compared to $699 million in the prior year. 
Core Office
FFO decreased by $122 million to $540 million primarily due to: 
• lower same-store net operating income mainly from certain retail tenants in our office portfolio, and lower contributions 
from recently completed developments which become operational but are not yet stabilized; and
• the absence of a one-time performance fee at Five Manhattan West and income from tax credits at The Eugene earned in 
the prior year.
Core Retail
FFO decreased by $222 million from the prior year to $550 million as a result of:
• mall closures in the second quarter due to the economic shutdown;
• incremental credit loss reserves, bankruptcy and co-tenant claims, and a reduction in income from temporary tenants and 
overage revenue; and
• the prior year period benefited from gains associated with the sale of a land parcel and financial assets, as well as 
incremental lease termination income; partially offset by
• lower interest expense and transaction income on the sale of investments.
LP Investments
BPY’s share of the FFO from its LP investments decreased by $214 million from the prior year due to closures and lower  
occupancy in our hospitality properties as a result of the economic shutdown, as well as dispositions during the year. These 
decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
Corporate
BPY’s corporate expenses of $370 million, which includes interest expense, management fees and other costs, decreased from 
the prior year due to lower asset management fees resulting from a lower market capitalization.
ii.  Other Real Estate Investments
FFO was $70 million in the current year, relatively consistent with the prior year. 
61    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
iii.  Realized Disposition Gains
Realized disposition gains of $393 million primarily relate to the sale of investment properties, most notably:
• the sale of a portfolio of assets within our directly held Fairfield investment generating gains of $221 million;
• One London Wall Place in our core office portfolio, contributing $91 million;
• our portfolio of self-storage assets in our LP investments portfolio for gains of $36 million; and
• the sale of two assets within our Brazilian office portfolio, contributing $22 million.
Disposition gains of $404 million in the prior year relate to: 
• a directly held residential management service company, contributing $101 million;
• certain core office properties in Australia and North America with gains totaling $67 million; and
• a number of multifamily and other LP investment properties.
Common Equity
Common equity in our Real Estate segment increased to $19.3 billion as at December 31, 2020 compared to $18.8 billion as at 
December 31, 2019. The benefits from FFO, additional shares purchased in BPY at a discount to book value, and incremental 
investments into our BSREP III fund were partially offset by distributions and valuation losses.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    62 
Business Overview
• We own and operate renewable power assets primarily through a 51% ownership interest in BEP, which is listed on the 
New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges and had a market capitalization of $30.5 billion at December 31, 2020.
• BEP owns one of the world’s largest publicly traded renewable power portfolios.
Operations
Hydroelectric
• We own, operate and invest in 219 hydroelectric generating stations on 82 river systems in North America, Brazil and 
Colombia. Our hydroelectric operations have 7,924 megawatts (“MW”) of installed capacity and annualized long-term 
average (“LTA”)1 generation of 19,661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) on a proportionate basis1.
Wind
• Our wind operations include 102 wind facilities globally with 4,690 MW of installed capacity and annualized LTA 
generation of 7,322 GWh on a proportionate basis.
Solar
• Our solar operations include 82 solar facilities globally with 2,050 MW of installed capacity and 1,941 GWh of annualized 
LTA generation on a proportionate basis.
Energy Transition
• Our distributed generation operation includes 4,912 facilities with 912 MW of installed capacity and 732 GWh of 
annualized LTA generation on a proportionate basis. 
• Our storage operations have 3,268 MW of installed capacity at our nine facilities and two river systems in North America 
and Europe.
Energy Contracts
• Based on LTA, we purchase approximately 3,600 GWh of power from BEP each year. We purchase 20% of BEP’s power 
generated in North America pursuant to a long-term contract at a predetermined price. 
• The fixed price that we are required to pay BEP will gradually step down over time resulting in an approximate $20 per 
megawatt hour (“MWh”) reduction by 2026 until the contract expires in 2046. Refer to Part 5 of this MD&A for additional 
information.
• We sell the power into the open market and also earn ancillary revenues, such as capacity fees and renewable power 
credits and premiums. This provides us with increased participation in future increases or decreases in power prices.

63    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Outlook and Growth Initiatives
Revenues in our Renewable Power segment are 84% contracted over an average contract term of 14 years, on a proportionate 
basis, with pricing that is inflation linked. By combining this with a stable cost profile, we are able to achieve consistent growth 
year over year within our existing business. In addition, we consistently identify capital development projects that provide an 
additional source of same-store growth. Our development pipeline represents approximately 23,000 MW of potential capacity 
globally, of which 2,789 MW are currently under construction. We expect them to contribute an incremental $61 million to 
BEP’s FFO when commissioned. We also have a strong track record of expanding our business through accretive acquisitions 
and will continue to seek out these opportunities.
We believe that the growing global demand for low-carbon energy will lead to continued growth opportunities for us in the 
future. In 2021, we intend to remain focused on progressing our key priorities, which includes surfacing margin expansion 
opportunities, progressing our development pipeline and assessing select contracting opportunities across the portfolio. We 
believe the investment environment for renewable power remains favorable and we expect to continue to advance our pipeline 
of opportunities.

Compared to the prior year, revenues and FFO excluding realized disposition gains increased by $111 million and $35 million, 
respectively. This was primarily due to higher contributions from our increased ownership in TERP, contributions from other 
recent acquisitions, higher realized margins on generation sold within our directly held energy contracts, and benefits from cost 
saving initiatives. This was partially offset by higher BEP management expenses, lower ownership in BEP, and unfavorable 
foreign currency impact in Brazil and Colombia.

3. Includes incentive distributions paid to Brookfield of $65 million (2019 – $48 million) as the general partner of BEP.
4. Segment reallocation refers to disposition gains, net of NCI, included in BEP’s operating FFO that we reclassify to realized disposition gains. This allows us to present 
FFO attributable to unitholders on the same basis as BEP.
BEP’s FFO for 2020 was $807 million, of which our share was $397 million. Generation for the year totaled 26,052 GWh, 
7% below the long-term average (“LTA”)1. Generation was largely in line with the prior year as the benefit from recent 
acquisitions was offset by lower hydrology.
Hydroelectric
The primary contributors to the $48 million decrease in FFO were:
• lower generation in North America; and
• the negative impact of foreign currency translation at our Brazilian and Colombian operations; partially offset by
• a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020 relating to a regulatory settlement in Brazil; and
• cost savings initiatives across the operations. 
Wind
Wind operations’ FFO increased by $62 million to $237 million due to:
• the gain on the sale of wind assets in Ireland;
• additional contributions from the privatization of TERP; and
• cost saving initiatives across the operations.
Solar 
FFO from our solar operations was $65 million higher than the prior year mainly as a result of our increased ownership in 
TERP and recently acquired solar assets in India and Spain.
65    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Energy Transition
FFO from our energy transition business increased by $33 million from the prior year due to:
• the contribution from our distributed generation portfolio through our increased ownership in TERP and other recent 
acquisitions; and
• benefits from cost reduction initiatives; partially offset by
• lower realized capacity prices and ancillary revenue in northeast U.S. and lower generation at our biomass facilities in 
Brazil.
Corporate
The corporate FFO loss increased by $66 million as a result of an increase in management fees due to higher market 
capitalization.
ii. Energy Contracts
During the year, we purchased 2,988 GWh (2019 – 4,066 GWh) from BEP at $80 per MWh (2019 – $79 per MWh) and sold 
the purchased generation at an average selling price of $39 per MWh (2019 – $31 per MWh). As a result we incurred an FFO 
loss of $126 million compared to a loss of $194 million in the prior year. 
iii. Realized Disposition Gains
Disposition gains of $773 million for the year primarily relate to the sale of approximately 15.4 million LP units of BEP, 
7 million Class A BEPC shares, and the sale of certain solar and wind assets. 
Prior year disposition gains relate to the sale of interests in certain hydro and wind assets, particularly within North America. 
Common Equity
Common equity in our Renewable Power segment decreased to $5.2 billion as at December 31, 2020 from $5.3 billion as at 
December 31, 2019. Contributions from FFO, revaluation gains, and the dilution gain on the issuance of BEPC shares as part of 
the TERP privatization, as well as gains from the secondary offering of BEP units and BEPC shares in the year, were more than 
offset by the foreign exchange impact on invested capital denominated in foreign currencies, depreciation, and distributions 
paid to investors. Our critical estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation of PP&E have not changed materially as a 
result of the global economic shutdown. Refer to Part 5 for further discussions.

Business Overview
• We own and operate infrastructure assets primarily through our 28% economic ownership interest in BIP, which is listed 
on the New York and Toronto Stock Exchanges and had a market capitalization of $24.0 billion at December 31, 2020.
• BIP is one of the largest globally diversified owners and operators of infrastructure in the world.
• We also have direct investments in sustainable resource operations.
Principal Operations
Utilities
• Our regulated transmission business includes ~4,200 km of natural gas pipelines in North America, South America and 
India, and ~5,300 km of transmission lines in Brazil, of which ~2,000 km are operational.
• Our commercial and residential distribution business provides residential energy infrastructure services to ~1.9 million 
customers annually in the U.S. and Canada and ~330,000 contract sub-metering services within Canada. We own and 
operate ~6.9 million connections, predominantly electricity and natural gas in the U.K and Colombia, and ~1.5 million 
acquired smart meters in the U.K.
• These businesses typically generate long-term returns on a regulated or contractual asset base which increase with capital 
we invest to upgrade and/or expand our systems. 
Transport
• We operate ~22,000 km of railroad track in North America and Europe, ~5,500 km of railroad track in Western Australia 
and ~4,800 km of railroad track in South America.
• Our toll road operations include ~3,800 km of motorways in Brazil, Chile, Peru and India.
• Our diversified terminals operations include 13 terminals in North America, the U.K., and Australia, and we provide 
~25 million tonnes per annum in our LNG export terminal in the U.S. and ~85 million tonnes per annum export facility in 
Australia.
• These operations are comprised of networks that provide transportation for freight, commodities and passengers. This 
includes businesses with price ceilings as a result of regulation, such as our rail and toll road operations, as well as 
unregulated businesses, such as our diversified terminals. 
Midstream
• We own and operate ~15,000 km of transmission pipelines, primarily in the U.S., and ~600 billion cubic feet of natural gas 
storage in the U.S. and Canada. There are 16 natural gas processing plants with ~2.9 Bcf per day of total processing

critical load capacity.
• These businesses provide critical infrastructure and essential services to media broadcasting and telecom sectors and are 
secured by long-term inflation-linked contracts.
67    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Outlook and Growth Initiatives
Our infrastructure business owns and operates assets that are critical to the global economy. Our expertise in managing and 
developing such assets make us ideal partners for the stakeholders. Our goal is to continue demonstrating our stewardship of 
critical infrastructure which should enable us to participate in future opportunities to acquire high-quality infrastructure 
businesses.
Approximately 95% of the FFO in our Infrastructure segment is supported by regulated or long-term contracts with pricing that 
is inflation-linked. Approximately 75% of FFO should capture the inflationary tariff increases, and approximately 35% of FFO 
should benefit from GDP growth by capturing increased volumes. As a result, we are able to achieve consistent growth year to 
year within our existing business. In addition, we have been consistently able to identify capital development projects that 
enable us to provide an additional source of growth. At the end of 2020, total capital to be commissioned in the next two to 
three years is ~$2.4 billion. Our backlog, coupled with inflation indexation and higher volumes from our GDP sensitive 
businesses, should result in another year of same-store growth at the high end of our 6 to 9% target range. Furthermore, we are 
continuing to target to deploy over $2 billion in 2021 in new investments. The contribution from new investments is expected 
to be enhanced by our capital recycling program which is on track to deliver over $2 billion of proceeds, a record for us in a 
given year.

BIP’s FFO for 2020 was $1.5 billion, of which our share was $358 million compared to $354 million in the prior year. Key 
variances for our businesses are described below.
Utilities
FFO of $659 million was $13 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to:
• delay in the recognition of connections revenue at our U.K. regulated distribution business; and 
• the sale of our Australian district energy business and Colombian distribution utility; partially offset by
• benefits of inflation-indexation, as well as capital deployed and the impact of acquisitions during the year.
Transport
FFO in our transport segment of $590 million was $13 million lower than the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to:
• lower volumes at our toll road businesses due to the impact from the economic shutdown; and
• the partial sale of Chilean toll road operations; partially offset by
• higher volumes across our rail networks in Australia and Brazil, as well as contributions from recently acquired 
businesses.
Midstream
FFO from our midstream operations of $289 million was $45 million higher than the prior year due to:
• strong transportation volumes and improved storage spreads across our portfolio; and
• the commissioning of two growth projects in the fourth quarter at our North American natural gas pipeline.
Data
FFO from our data operations of $196 million was $60 million higher than the prior year due to: 
• inflation-indexation and new points-of-presence added at our French telecom business; and
• the acquisition of our Indian telecom tower operation, as well as increased contributions from our data distribution 
businesses in New Zealand and in the U.K.
69    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Corporate
The Corporate FFO loss of $280 million increased by $9 million from the prior year as a result of higher base management fee 
expenses from an increase in market capitalization, partially offset by higher investment income.
ii. Sustainable Resources and Other
FFO at our agriculture operations decreased from prior year due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real and the sale of 
Acadian, resulting in a decrease of $12 million.
iii. Realized Disposition Gains
In the current year, disposition gains of $201 million primarily relate to the gain recognized on the secondary offering of BIPC 
shares and the sale of our North American electricity transmission operation located in Texas.
The prior year disposition gain of $88 million relates to the sale of Acadian and our partial interest in a Chilean toll business. 
This gain was partially offset by a loss on the sale of a European port business.
Common Equity
Common equity in our Infrastructure segment was $2.6 billion as at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – $2.8 billion). 
The contributions from earnings and revaluation surplus were more than offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies against 
the U.S. dollar, losses on financial instruments and distributions to unitholders. 
This equity is primarily our investment in PP&E and certain concessions, which are recorded as intangible assets. Our PP&E is 
recorded at fair value and revalued annually while concessions are considered intangible assets under IFRS and therefore 
recorded at historical cost and amortized over the life of the concession. Accordingly, a smaller portion of our equity is 
impacted by revaluation compared to our Real Estate and Renewable Power segments, where a larger portion of the 
balance sheet is subject to revaluations. Our critical estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation of PP&E, as well as 
intangibles assets have not changed materially as a result of the global economic shutdown. Refer to Part 5 for discussions.

Outlook and Growth Initiatives
Our private equity business utilizes our expertise in evaluating investment opportunities and applying an operational approach 
to create value within the businesses we acquire. Our private equity investments are well diversified across industries and 
geographies, and we expect the business to continue to expand its operations and move forward with a number of recently 
announced initiatives. 
In October 2020, within our business services segment, we entered into an agreement to acquire the 43% publicly held shares 
of Sagen. Privatizing the company will provide us additional opportunities to optimize the capital structure and enhance the 
long-term cash generation potential of the business. Subsequent to year end, together with institutional partners, we completed 
the acquisition of Everise, a process outsourcing company which specializes in managing complex customer interactions for 
large global healthcare and technology clients. We believe this business has significant opportunities to grow and expand, 
particularly in the high growth healthcare and technology sectors. 
Within  our  infrastructure  services  segment,  our  BrandSafway  investment  is  well  positioned  to  capitalize  on  market 
consolidation opportunities which we believe will accelerate as a result of the current economic environment. In December 
2020, BrandSafway acquired Big City Access, becoming Texas’ largest premier commercial work access provider. Within our 
Westinghouse investment, demand remained consistent throughout the year and we continue to advance initiatives to build 
value within the business. 
Within our industrials segment, we continue to enhance the operations at Clarios which has now recovered from a decline in 
sales volume in the first half of the year due to the economic shutdown. We continue to meaningfully advance business 
improvement plans at Clarios focused on optimizing its U.S. manufacturing operations. We remain focused on capital recycling 
initiatives and have further reduced our ownership in GrafTech during 2020 and early 2021, to crystalize strong returns for our 
investors. The market downturn in early 2020 created an opportunity for us, alongside institutional partners, to invest in the 
equity of high-quality businesses. With the recovery in public markets during the second half of the year, the market value of 
these securities has increased significantly, and we have begun to monetize our positions which we expect to generate strong 
returns for our investors.
Geographically, we continue to be committed to taking a long-term view on the regions where Brookfield has an established 
presence and to invest further during periods of market weakness.

1. Brookfield’s interest in BBU consists of 69.7 million redemption-exchange units, 24.8 million limited partnership units and eight general partnership units together 
representing an economic interest of 64% of BBU.
Revenues generated from our private equity operations decreased by $5.8 billion primarily due to lower volumes at Greenergy, 
reduced contribution from Multiplex due to lower activity in the U.K, and the absence of contributions from the dispositions of 
BGIS and BRGS in the prior year period. This was partially offset by a full year of contributions from the acquisitions 
of Clarios and Healthscope in the second quarter of 2019, and Sagen in the fourth quarter of 2019.
FFO, prior to disposition gains, increased $270 million to $821 million primarily due to an increase in OSB pricing at Norbord, 
as well as contributions from the aforementioned acquisitions, and increased ownership in Altera. Disposition gains were 
$179 million lower in the current year. Current year gains primarily included the sale of Nova Cold, the pathology business at 
Healthscope, a partial interest in GrafTech, and a number of public securities.

1. Segment reallocation and other refers to disposition gains, net of NCI, included in BBU’s FFO that we reclassify to realized disposition gains. This allows us to present 
FFO attributable to unitholders on the same basis as BBU.
BBU generated $870 million of FFO compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, including realized gains. Excluding these gains, 
our share was $498 million, consistent with $494 million in the prior year.
Business Services
Business services’ FFO decreased by $203 million to $229 million primarily due to the absence of realized gains on the sales of 
BGIS and BGRS in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by disposition gains on Nova Cold in the first quarter of 2020 
and Healthscope’s pathology business in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding gains on assets sold that we reclassify to 
realized disposition gains, FFO increased primarily due to:
• a full year of contributions from Healthscope and Sagen, which were acquired in the second and fourth quarter of 2019, 
respectively; and 
• contributions from IndoStar, which was acquired in the third quarter of 2020; partially offset by
• lower volumes at Greenergy and decreased project activity at Multiplex.
73    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Infrastructure Services
Within our infrastructure services operations, we generated $364 million of FFO, compared to $314 million in the prior year. 
The increase was primarily due to:
• increased contributions from Altera following the privatization of the business, in which we increased our ownership from 
31% to 43%;
• contributions from the acquisition of BrandSafway in the first quarter of 2020; and
• higher contributions from Westinghouse due to new plant projects, strong performance in the core plant servicing 
operations and ongoing cost saving initiatives.
Industrials
FFO from our industrials portfolio decreased by $57 million to $336 million due to the realized gain on the sale of NAP 
benefiting the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding realized gains, FFO increased primarily due to:
• higher sales volume from Clarios; partially offset by
• lower sales volume and prices charged at GrafTech  and a decreased ownership in the business.
Corporate
The Corporate FFO deficit increased by $22 million due to higher interest expenses, partially offset by an increase to current 
income tax recoveries.
ii. Other Investments 
FFO from other investments increased by $266 million to $323 million as a result of higher earnings at Norbord due to higher 
realized OSB pricing.
iii. Realized Disposition Gains
Realized disposition gains were $114 million in the year, compared to $293 million in the prior year. During the current year, 
we completed the sale of Nova Cold, the pathology business at Healthscope, a partial interest in GrafTech, and a number of 
public securities.
In the prior year, we recognized disposition gains related to the sale of BGRS, BGIS, several industrial assets at our wastewater 
and industrial water treatment business in Brazil, our controlling interest in palladium mining operations, and a partial interest 
in GrafTech.
Common Equity 
Common equity in our Private Equity segment was $4.0 billion as at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – $4.1 billion). 
The decrease is primarily attributable to foreign currency translation, distributions to unit holders and depreciation expense. 
These decreases were partially offset by contributions from operating performance. The assets held in these operations are 
recorded at amortized cost, with depreciation recorded on a quarterly basis, with the exception of investments in financial 
assets, which are carried at fair value based predominantly on quoted prices.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    74 
Business Overview
• Our residential development business operates predominantly in North America and Brazil.
• Our North American business is conducted through Brookfield Residential Properties Inc., is active in 12 principal markets 
in Canada and the U.S. and controls approximately 85,000 lots. 
• Our Brazilian business includes construction, sales and marketing of a broad range of residential and commercial office 
units, with a primary focus on middle income residential units in Brazil’s largest markets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
Outlook and Growth Initiatives
At our North American residential business, we are actively working on closing our residential housing backlog of $1 billion, 
while growing our mixed-use development business and evaluating other built forms to keep us in step with the changing 
preferences and requirements of our consumer base. 
Residential real estate development in Brazil remains challenging following years of industry overdevelopment. However, 
recently implemented regulatory changes are expected to positively impact the industry going forward. We remain focused on 
developing high margin projects in select key markets and excelling in all operational areas.
Summary of Operating Results
The following table disaggregates segment revenues, FFO and common equity into the amounts attributable to the two 
principal operating regions of our wholly-owned residential development businesses:

North America
FFO from our North American business decreased by $70 million to $76 million. The decrease is largely driven by fewer land 
closings and lower gross margin due to the geographic mix of the land sold. These impacts were partially offset by cost savings 
measures and reductions in sales commission, in line with the reduced quantity of home and land closings. 
Residential housing sales activity were significantly stronger in the second half of the year compared to the prior period, and 
we expect to recognize this benefit through income in 2021 as we complete construction.
As at December 31, 2020, we had 80 active housing communities (2019 – 93) and 22 active land communities (2019 – 28). 
Brazil and Other
Our FFO loss at our Brazilian and other operations decreased compared to the prior year. The improvement in FFO is largely 
driven by the sale of recently constructed projects at higher margins and a deferred income tax recovery at our Australian 
residential business.
Our Brazilian operations began 2020 with 23 projects under construction and as of December 31, 2020, we have 24 projects 
under construction, all of which relates to projects launched over the past few years with relatively higher margins than our 
legacy projects.
Common Equity
Common equity was $2.7 billion as at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – $2.9 billion) and consists largely of 
residential development inventory which is carried at historical cost, or the lower of cost and market, notwithstanding the 
length of time that we may have held these assets and created value through the development process. The decrease in common 
equity is primarily attributable to weakening of the Brazilian real in comparison to the U.S. dollar.

Business Overview
• Our corporate activities provide support to the overall business, including both our asset management franchise and our 
invested capital. These activities include the development, and seeding, of new fund strategies, supporting the growth in 
our listed affiliates, and providing liquidity to the organization, when needed. In addition, we will make direct investments 
on an opportunistic basis.
• We also hold cash and financial assets as part of our liquidity management operations and enter into financial contracts to 
manage residual foreign exchange and other risks, as appropriate.

1. FFO excludes preferred share distributions of $142 million (2019 – $152 million).
2. Includes $230 million of perpetual subordinated notes issued in November 2020 by a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield, included within non-controlling interest.
Our portfolio of corporate cash and financial assets is generally recorded at fair value with changes recognized through net 
income, unless the underlying financial investments are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, in which 
case changes in value are recognized in other comprehensive income. Loans and receivables are typically carried at amortized 
cost. As at December 31, 2020, our portfolio of corporate cash and financial assets includes $3.2 billion of cash and cash 
equivalents (2019 – $789 million). The increase is a result of four issuances of corporate debt, totaling $2.3 billion in the 
current year, our $230 million issuance of subordinated preferred shares, as well as proceeds received from the partial sale of 
BIPC shares, BEP units and BEPC shares in the year. This was partially offset by the early redemption of $251 million 
(C$350 million) of corporate debt in the first quarter, dividends paid to shareholders, funding of capital calls in our BSREP III 
fund and the repurchase of 8.9 million Class A shares on a post-split basis.
Our corporate cash and financial assets generated FFO of $377 million compared to $123 million in the prior year, primarily 
due to higher mark-to-market gains on our financial assets in the current year.
Corporate  borrowings  are  generally  issued  with  fixed  interest  rates.  Some  of  these  borrowings  are  denominated  in 
Canadian dollars and therefore the carrying value fluctuates with changes in the exchange rate. A number of these borrowings 
have been designated as hedges of our Canadian dollar net investments within our other segments, resulting in the majority of 
the currency revaluation being recognized in other comprehensive income. The $388 million FFO expense reported through 
corporate borrowings reflects the interest expense on those borrowings. The increase from the prior year quarter was primarily 
as a result of the aforementioned net increase in our borrowings, partially offset by the foreign exchange impact of our 
Canadian dollar interest expense as a result of a decrease in the average exchange rate compared to the prior year.
Preferred equity increased by $230 million due to the aforementioned issuance of subordinated preferred shares. Preferred 
shares do not revalue under IFRS. 
We describe cash and financial assets, corporate borrowings and preferred equity in more detail within Part 4 – Capitalization 
and Liquidity.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    76 
Other corporate investments include warehoused investments on behalf of our insurance and pension businesses, as well as the 
non-asset management related investment in Oaktree which was acquired in the third quarter of 2019. FFO pertains to margins 
on pension assets acquired, returns on Oaktree’s balance sheet investments and a full year contribution of non-asset 
management income at Oaktree.
Net working capital was in an asset position of $742 million as at December 31, 2020, an increase from the prior year balance 
of $470 million. Included within this balance are net deferred income tax assets of $1.7 billion (2019 – $2.2 billion). The FFO 
loss of $151 million includes corporate costs and cash taxes which increased primarily as a result of higher professional fees 
and compensation expense and the absence of the release of a previously recorded tax reserve compared to the prior year.
Disposition gains of $71 million were the result of a partial sale of an investment previously recognized through other 
comprehensive income.

PART 4 – CAPITALIZATION AND LIQUIDITY
CAPITALIZATION
We review key components of our capitalization in the following sections. In several instances we have disaggregated the 
balances into the amounts attributable to our operating segments in order to facilitate discussion and analysis. 
Corporate Capitalization – reflects the amount of debt that is recourse to the Corporation and held in the Corporate segment as 
well as our issued and outstanding common and preferred shares. Corporate debt includes unsecured bonds and, from time to 
time, draws on revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2020, our corporate capitalization was $50.5 billion (December 31, 
2019 – $47.1 billion) with a debt to capitalization of 18% (December 31, 2019 – 15%). 
Consolidated Capitalization1 – reflects the full capitalization of wholly owned, partially-owned, and managed entities that we 
consolidate in our financial statements. At December 31, 2020, consolidated capitalization increased compared to the prior year 
largely due to acquisitions, which resulted in additional associated borrowings, working capital balances and non-controlling 
interests. Much of the borrowings issued within our managed entities are included in our consolidated balance sheet not 
withstanding that virtually none of this debt has any recourse to the Corporation.
The following table presents our capitalization on a corporate and consolidated basis:

had an average term to maturity of 14 years (December 31, 2019 – 10 years). Term debt consists of public and private bonds, 
all of which are fixed rate and have maturities ranging from March 2023 until 2080. These financings provide an important 
source of long-term capital and are appropriately matched to our long-term asset profile.
1. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    78 
The increase in term debt compared to the prior year is due to the issuance of $600 million of 3.45% notes with a 
2050 maturity, the issuance of $750 million of 4.35% notes with a 2030 maturity, the issuance of $500 million of 3.50% notes 
with a 2051 maturity and the issuance of $400 million of 4.625% subordinated notes with a 2080 maturity, partially offset by 
the early repayment of $251 million (C$350 million) of 5.30% notes due on March 1, 2021, as well as $20 million of foreign 
currency appreciation.
We had no commercial paper or bank borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – $nil). Our 
commercial paper program is supplemented by our $2.6 billion revolving term credit facilities with maturities ranging from 
2022 to 2024. As at December 31, 2020, $64 million of the facilities were utilized for letters of credit (December 31, 2019 – 
$66 million). 
Subsidiary Borrowings
We endeavor to capitalize our principal subsidiaries to enable continuous access to the debt capital markets, usually on an 
investment-grade basis, thereby reducing the demand for capital from the Corporation.

Subsidiary borrowings include listed affiliates’ recourse term debt and credit facility draws. It has no recourse to the 
Corporation.
Property-Specific Borrowings
As part of our financing strategy, the majority of our debt capital is in the form of property-specific borrowings and project 
financings and is denominated in local currencies that have recourse only to the assets being financed and have no recourse to 
the Corporation or the listed affiliates.

Property-specific borrowings have increased by $687 million since December 31, 2019. The increase in borrowings is largely 
attributable to acquisitions in our infrastructure and private equity operations, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a 
hospitality investment as well as the transfer of assets from our self-storage portfolio to assets held for sale.
Fixed and Floating Interest Rate Exposure
Many of our borrowings, including all corporate borrowings recourse to the Corporation, are fixed rate, long-term financings. 
The remainder of our borrowings are at floating rates; however, from time to time, we enter into interest rate contracts to fix the 
interest rate and reduce our floating rate exposure.
As at December 31, 2020, approximately 73% of consolidated debt outstanding, reflecting swaps, was fixed rate. Accordingly, 
changes in interest rates are typically limited to the impact of refinancing borrowings at prevailing market rates or changes in 
the level of debt as a result of acquisitions and dispositions.

Non-controlling interests
In November 2020, we issued $230 million of perpetual subordinated notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield, 
included within non-controlling interest. The notes have a coupon of 4.50% and the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will 
be used to finance and/or refinance recently completed and future eligible climate and environmental projects.
ii.  Preferred Equity
Preferred equity is comprised of perpetual preferred shares and represents permanent non-participating equity that provides 
leverage to our common equity. The shares are categorized by their principal characteristics in the following table:

The company holds 64.2 million Class A shares (2019 – 63.5 million) purchased by consolidated entities in respect of long-
term share ownership programs, which have been deducted from the total amount of shares outstanding at the date acquired. 
Diluted shares outstanding include 14.6 million (2019 – 18.3 million) shares issuable in respect of these plans based on the 
market value of the Class A shares at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, resulting in a net reduction of 49.6 million 
(2019 – 45.2 million) diluted shares outstanding.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    80 
During 2020, 6.4 million options were exercised, of which 2.6 million and 0.6 million were issued on a net-settled and gross 
basis, respectively, resulting in the cancellation of 3.2 million vested options.
The cash value of unexercised options was $1.2 billion as at December 31, 2020 (2019 – $1.2 billion) based on the proceeds 
that would be paid on exercise of the options.
On April 1, 2020, the company completed a three-for-two stock split by way of a stock dividend of one-half of a Class A share 
for each Class A and Class B share outstanding, resulting in the issuance of 524 million Class A shares.
As of March 22, 2021, the Corporation had outstanding 1,510,383,395 Class A shares and 85,120 Class B shares. Refer to 
Note 21 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on equity.
LIQUIDITY
Corporate Liquidity
We maintain significant liquidity at the corporate level. Our primary sources of liquidity, which we refer to as core liquidity, 
consist of:
• cash and financial assets, net of other associated liabilities; and
• undrawn committed credit facilities.
We further assess overall liquidity inclusive of our principal subsidiaries BPY, BEP, BIP, BBU and Oaktree because of their 
role in funding acquisitions both directly and through our managed funds. Overall core liquidity at year end was $16.0 billion, 
or inclusive of investor commitments to our private funds, was $76.6 billion at the end of the year, as we continue to pursue a 
number of attractive investment opportunities. In addition to these balances, we hold approximately $1.5 billion of publicly 
traded investments within our managed investments that can be readily sold in the public market.
Capital Requirements 
Corporate
The Corporation has very few non-discretionary capital requirements. Our largest normal course capital requirement is our debt 
maturities. There are no corporate debt maturities until March 2023 when $471 million (C$600 million) is due. Periodically, we 
will also participate in our listed affiliates equity offerings and seed new investment strategies. 
On January 31, 2019, the Corporation committed $2.75 billion to our third flagship real estate fund. As of December 31, 2020, 
the Corporation has funded $1.3 billion of the total commitment.
On August 3, 2020, the Corporation committed $750 million to our latest distressed debt fund. As of December 31, 2020, the 
Corporation has funded $38 million of the total commitment.
Listed Affiliates
At the listed affiliate level, the largest normal course capital requirements are debt maturities and the pro-rata share of private 
fund capital calls. New acquisitions are primarily funded through the private funds or listed affiliates that we manage. We 
endeavor to structure these entities so that they are self-funding, preferably on an investment-grade basis, and in almost all 
circumstances do not rely on financial support from the Corporation. 
In the case of private funds, the necessary equity capital is obtained by calling on commitments made by the limited partners in 
each fund, which include commitments made by our listed affiliates. In the case of our real estate, infrastructure and 
private equity funds, these commitments are expected to be funded by BPY, BEP, BIP and BBU.  In the case of listed affiliates, 
capital requirements are funded through their own resources and access to capital markets, which may be supported by us from 
time to time through participation in equity offerings or bridge financings. 
Asset Level
At the asset level, we schedule ongoing capital expenditure programs to maintain the operating capacity of our assets at existing 
levels. We refer to this as sustaining capital expenditures. The sustaining capital expenditure program are typically funded by, 
and represent a relatively small proportion of, the operating cash flows within each business. The timing of these expenditures 
is discretionary; however, we believe it is important to maintain the productivity of our assets in order to optimize cash flows 
and value accretion.

2. See definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
As at December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s core liquidity was $7.0 billion, consisting of $4.5 billion in cash and financial 
assets, net of other liabilities and $2.5 billion in undrawn credit facilities. The Corporation’s liquidity is readily available for 
use without any material tax consequences. We utilize this liquidity to support the growth of our business which includes 
supporting the activities of our listed affiliates and private funds, as well as seeding new investment products.
The Corporation also has the ability to raise additional liquidity through the issuance of securities and the partial sale of 
holdings of our listed affiliates and other holdings including those listed on page 83. However, this is not included in our core 
liquidity as we are generally able to finance our operations and capital requirements from core liquidity and recurring free cash 
flow. 
The Corporation generates significant cash available for distribution and/or reinvestment1. Our primary sources of recurring 
cash flows include:
• fee-related earnings from our asset management activities and proceeds in the form of realized carried interest from asset 
sales within private funds;
• distributions from invested capital, in particular our listed affiliates; and
• other invested capital earnings: comprised of our wholly owned investments offset by corporate interest expense, corporate 
costs and taxes and dividends paid on preferred shares.
During 2020, we generated $3.1 billion of cash available for distribution and/or reinvestment, inclusive of:
• $1.2 billion of fee-related earnings and $244 million of realized carried interest, net, excluding Oaktree; 
   
• $259 million of distributable earnings from our investment in Oaktree; and
 
• $1.9 billion of distributions from our listed affiliates, other investments, and corporate cash and financial assets; partially 
 
offset by
• other invested capital earnings, including corporate costs and interest expense, and preferred share dividends paid, net of 
equity-based compensation costs, which resulted in expenses of $571 million.
The Corporation paid $726 million in cash dividends on its common equity during the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 – 
$620 million).

This statement reflects activities within our consolidated operations and therefore excludes activities within non-consolidated 
entities.
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities totaled $8.3 billion in 2020, a $2.0 billion increase from 2019. Operating cash flows prior 
to non-cash working capital and residential inventory were $8.6 billion this year, $917 million higher than the prior year due to 
the benefits of same-store growth from our existing operations and the contributions from assets acquired during the last twelve 
months, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
Financing Activities
The company had a net cash inflow of $8.7 billion from financing activities in 2020, compared to $28.7 billion in 2019. Our 
subsidiaries issued $37.6 billion (2019 – $64.6 billion) and repaid $33.5 billion (2019 – $42.2 billion) of non-recourse 
borrowings, for a net issuance of $4.1 billion (2019 – $22.4 billion) during the year. We raised $16.3 billion of capital from our 
institutional private fund partners and other investors to fund their portion of acquisitions, $1.7 billion of short-term borrowings 
backed by private fund commitments and returned $10.1 billion to our investors in the form of either distributions or returns of 
capital. 
Investing Activities
During 2020, we invested $41.8 billion and generated proceeds of $28.6 billion from dispositions for net cash deployed in 
investing activities of $13.3 billion. This compares to net cash deployed of $37.1 billion in 2019. We paid cash of $3.5 billion 
to acquire consolidated subsidiaries, mainly at our Infrastructure segment, and a further $3.7 billion to acquire equity accounted 
investments during the year. Refer to our Acquisitions of Consolidated Entities in Note 4 and Equity Accounted Investments in 
Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. We continued to acquire and sell financial assets, which 
represent a net outflow of $2.5 billion, relating to investments in debt and equity securities as well as contract assets associated 
with managing currency risk.
Sustaining capital expenditures in the company’s renewable power operations were $493 million (2019 – $160 million), in 
its real estate operations were $651 million (2019 – $767 million), in its infrastructure operations were $434 million (2019 – 
$180 million) and in its private equity operations were $551 million (2019 – $482 million).

The recourse obligations, those amounts that have recourse to the Corporation, which are due in less than one year totaled 
$2.3 billion (2019 – $3.0 billion). 
The Corporation entered into arrangements in 2014 with respect to $1.8 billion of exchangeable preferred equity units issued by 
BPY, which are redeemable in equal tranches of $600 million in 2021, 2024 and 2026, respectively. The preferred equity units 
are exchangeable into equity units of BPY at $25.70 per unit, at the option of the holder, at any time up to and including the 
maturity date. BPY may redeem the preferred equity units after specified periods if the BPY equity unit price exceeds 
predetermined amounts. At maturity, the preferred equity units will be converted into BPY equity units at the lower of $25.70 
or the then market price of a BPY equity unit. In order to provide the purchaser with enhanced liquidity, the Corporation has 
agreed to purchase the preferred equity units for cash at the option of the holder, for the initial purchase price plus accrued and 
unpaid dividends. In order to decrease dilution risk to BPY, the Corporation has agreed with the holder and BPY that if the 
price of a BPY equity unit is less than 80% of the exchange price of $25.70 at the redemption date of the 2021 and 2024 
tranches, the Corporation will acquire the preferred equity units subject to redemption, at the redemption price, and to exchange 
these preferred equity units for preferred equity units with similar terms and conditions, including redemption date, as the 2026 
tranche. Accordingly, commitments in 2020 include $121 million, which represents the carrying value of the exchange option 
at the time of issuance in respect of BPY’s subsidiary preferred units, and the remaining $1.7 billion was recorded within 
subsidiary equity obligations.
Commitments of $4.1 billion (2019 – $4.1 billion) represent various contractual obligations assumed in the normal course of 
business by our various operating subsidiaries. These included commitments to provide bridge financing and letters of credit 
and guarantees provided in respect of power sales contracts and reinsurance obligations. These commitments shall be funded 
through the cash flows of the company’s subsidiaries.
85    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
The company and its consolidated subsidiaries execute agreements that provide for indemnifications and guarantees to third 
parties in transactions or dealings such as business dispositions, business acquisitions, sales of assets, provision of services, 
securitization agreements and underwriting and agency agreements. The company has also agreed to indemnify its directors 
and certain of its officers and employees. The nature of substantially all of the indemnification undertakings prevents the 
company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount the company could be required to pay third 
parties, as in most cases the agreements do not specify a maximum amount, and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome 
of future contingent events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time. Neither the company nor its 
consolidated subsidiaries have made significant payments in the past, nor do they expect at this time to make any significant 
payments under such indemnification agreements in the future. 
The company periodically enters into joint venture, consortium or other arrangements that have contingent liquidity rights in 
favor of the company or its counterparties. These include buy sell arrangements, registration rights and other customary 
arrangements. These agreements generally have embedded protective terms that mitigate the risk to us. The amount, timing and 
likelihood of any payments by the company under these arrangements is, in most cases, dependent on either future contingent 
events or circumstances applicable to the counterparty and therefore cannot be determined at this time. 
We have also committed to purchase power produced by certain of BEP’s hydroelectric assets as previously described on 
page 63. 
EXPOSURES TO SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
As discussed elsewhere in this MD&A, we utilize various financial instruments in our business to manage risk and make better 
use of our capital. The fair values of these instruments that are reflected on our balance sheets are disclosed in Note 6 to our 
consolidated financial statements.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    86 
PART 5 – ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Overview
We are a Canadian corporation and, as such, we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. 
We present our consolidated balance sheets on a non-classified basis, meaning that we do not distinguish between current and 
long-term assets or liabilities. We believe this classification is appropriate given the nature of our business strategy.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to 
make judgments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
In making judgments and estimates, management relies on external information and observable conditions, where possible, 
supplemented by internal analysis, as required. These estimates have been applied in a manner consistent with the prior year 
and there are no known trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that we believe will materially affect the methodology or 
assumptions utilized in this report. As we update the fair values of our investment property portfolios quarterly, with gains 
reflected in net income, we discuss judgments and estimates relating to the key valuation metrics below.
For further reference on accounting policies, including new and revised standards issued by the IASB and judgments and 
estimates, see our significant accounting policies contained in Note 3 of the December 31, 2020 consolidated financial 
statements.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to COVID-19. To date, there have been 
restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions and the global movement of people and certain goods. In light of 
the economic environment, the company has assessed the impact of the economic shutdowns on our asset valuations. In making 
these assessments, we reviewed business risks, cash flow assumptions, and discount rates for the impacts of government 
imposed shutdowns. We have applied certain assumptions as to the pace of economic recovery and continue to monitor 
operating results against them. As many of our businesses have been a provider of essential services, they have remained in 
operation while we continue to safeguard the health of our employees. As at December 31, 2020, we have updated our asset 
valuations based on the analysis performed. 
Consolidated Financial Information
IFRS uses a control-based model to determine if consolidation is required. Therefore, we are deemed to control an investment 
if we: (1) exercise power over the investee; (2) are exposed to variable returns from our involvement with the investee; and 
(3) have the ability to use our power to affect the amount of the returns. Due to the ownership structure of many of our 
subsidiaries, we control entities in which we hold only a minority economic interest. Refer to Part 2 of this MD&A for 
additional information.
i. Investment Properties
We classify the majority of the property assets within our Real Estate segment as investment properties. Our valuations are 
prepared at the individual property level by internal investment professionals with the appropriate expertise in the respective 
industry, geography and asset type. These valuations are updated at each balance sheet date with gains or losses recognized in 
net income. 
87    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Prior to the end of the first quarter, the global economic shutdown prompted certain responses from global government 
authorities across the various geographies in which the company owns and operates investment properties. Such responses, 
have included mandatory temporary closure of, or imposed limitations on, the operations of certain non-essential properties and 
businesses including office properties and retail malls and associated businesses which operate within these properties such as 
retailers and restaurants. In addition, shelter-in-place mandates and severe travel restrictions have had a significant adverse 
impact on consumer spending and demand. These negative economic indicators, restrictions and closures have created 
significant estimation uncertainty in the determination of the fair value of investment properties as of December 31, 2020. 
Specifically, while discount and capitalization rates are inherently uncertain, there has been an absence of recently observed 
market transactions across the company’s geographies to support changes in such rates which is a key input into the 
determination of fair value. In addition, the company has had to make assumptions with respect to the length and severity of 
these restrictions and closures as well as the viability of our real estate tenants in consideration of any credit reserves that 
should be applied based on deemed tenant risk and the recovery period in estimating the impact and timing of future cash flows 
generated from investment properties and used in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value. As a result of 
this material estimation uncertainty, there is a risk that the assumptions used to determine fair value as of December 31, 2020 
may result in a material adjustment to the fair value of investment properties in future reporting periods as more information 
becomes available.
The majority of underlying cash flows in the models are comprised of contracted leases, many of which are long term, with our 
core office portfolio having a combined 90% occupancy level and an average 8.1 year lease life, while our core retail portfolio 
has an occupancy rate of 92%. The models also include property-level assumptions for renewal probabilities, future leasing 
rates and capital expenditures. These are reviewed as part of the business planning process and external market data is utilized 
when determining the cash flows associated with lease renewals.
We test the outcome of our process by having a number of our properties externally appraised each year, including appraisals 
for core office properties, at least on a three-year rotating basis. We compare the results of the external appraisals to our 
internally prepared values and reconcile significant differences when they arise. During 2020, 85 of our properties were 
externally appraised, representing a gross property value of $32 billion of assets; external appraisals were within 1% of 
management’s valuations.
The  valuations  are  most  sensitive  to  changes  in  cash  flows,  which  include  assumptions  relating  to  lease  renewal 
probabilities, downtime, capital expenditures, future leasing rates and associated leasing costs, discount rates and terminal 
capitalization rates. The key valuation metrics of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are 
summarized below.

We undertook a process to assess the appropriateness of the discount and terminal capitalization rates considering changes to 
property-level cash flows and any risk premium inherent in such cash flow changes as well as the current cost of capital and 
credit spreads. These considerations led us to make some discount rate changes to certain of our assets, mostly within our retail 
portfolio for assets where we have more exposure to anchor tenants who have recently filed for bankruptcy. We did not make 
holistic changes overall to our discount rates or terminal capitalization rates, as we were largely impacted by detailed revision 
of our cashflow models and feel comfortable with the level of risk applied in our cashflows. As we learn more about the mid- 
and longer-term impacts of the pandemic on our business we will update our valuation models accordingly. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    88 
The following table presents the impact on the fair value of our consolidated investment properties as at December 31, 2020 
from a 25-basis point change to the relevant unobservable inputs. For properties valued using the discounted cash flow method, 
the basis point change in valuation metrics relates to a change in discount and terminal capitalization rates. For properties 
valued using the direct capitalization approach, the basis point change in valuation metrics relates to a change in the overall 
capitalization rate. These amounts represent the effect on all consolidated investment property assets within the consolidated 
financial statements of BAM on a pre-tax basis, including amounts attributed to non-controlling interests in our listed affiliates 
and private fund investments. The amounts attributable to shareholders may be significantly less than shown depending on 
ownership levels in the individual assets.

ii. Revaluation Method for PP&E
Within our Infrastructure and Renewable Power segments, we revalue our PP&E using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) 
approach; our Real Estate hospitality assets are valued using the depreciated replacement cost method. PP&E within our Private 
Equity segment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Assets subject to the revaluation approach are revalued annually following a bottom-up approach, starting at the operating level 
with local professionals, and involving multiple levels of review, including by senior management. Changes in fair value are 
reported through other comprehensive income as revaluation surplus. Underlying cash flows used in DCF models are subject to 
detailed reviews as part of the business planning, with discount rates and other key variable inputs reviewed for reasonability 
and the models reviewed for mathematical accuracy. Key inputs are frequently compared to third-party reports commissioned 
by the respective entities to assess reasonability. In addition, comparable market transactions are analyzed to consider for 
benchmarking. Additional information about the revaluation methodology and current year results is provided below.
When determining the carrying value of PP&E using the revaluation method, the company uses the following assumptions and 
estimates: the timing of forecasted revenues; future sales prices and associated expenses; future sales volumes; future 
regulatory rates; maintenance and other capital expenditures; discount rates; terminal capitalization rates; terminal valuation 
dates; useful lives; and residual values. Determination of the fair value of PP&E under development includes estimates in 
respect of the timing and cost to complete the development. This process is further discussed in Part 2 of this MD&A.
89    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Renewable Power
Perpetual renewable power assets, such as many of our hydroelectric facilities, are revalued using 20-year discounted cash flow 
models with a terminal value that is determined, where appropriate, using the Gordon growth model. For assets with finite 
lives, such as wind and solar farms, the cash flow model is based on the estimated remaining service life and the residual asset 
value is used to represent the terminal value. Key inputs into the models, which include forward merchant power prices, energy 
generation estimates, operating and capital expenditures, tax rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are assessed 
on an asset-by-asset basis as part of the bottom-up preparation and review process. The key inputs that affect cash flow 
projections are outlined below:
• To determine estimated future energy pricing, we consider the contract pricing for the proportion of our revenue that is 
subject to power purchase agreements. Long-term pricing is driven by the economics required to support new entrants into 
the various power markets in which we operate. Our long-term view is anchored to the cost of securing new energy from 
renewable sources to meet future demand growth by the years 2026 to 2035 in North America, 2028 in Colombia, 2023 in 
Europe and 2024 in Brazil. The year of new entry is viewed as the point when generators must build additional capacity to 
maintain system reliability and provide an adequate level of reserve generation with the retirement of older coal-fired 
plants and rising environmental compliance costs in North America and Europe, and overall increasing demand in 
Colombia and Brazil. Once the year of new entrant is determined, data from industry sources, as well as inputs from our 
development teams, is used to model the all-in cost of the expected technology mix of new construction, and the resulting 
market price required to support its development. For the North American and European businesses, we have estimated 
our renewable power assets will contract at discount to new-build wind prices (the most likely source of new renewable 
generation in those regions). In Brazil and Colombia, the estimate of future electricity prices is based on a similar approach 
as applied in North America using a forecast of the all-in cost of development. For the remaining pricing, referred to as 
merchant pricing, we use a mix of external data and our own estimates to derive the price curves.
• Short-term merchant revenue forecasts consist of four years of externally sourced broker quotes in North America, two 
years of gas pricing in Europe and a combination of short-term contracts and local market pricing in South America. Short-
term pricing is linked by linear extrapolation to long-term power views.
• Energy generation forecasts are based on LTA for which we have significant historical data. LTA for hydroelectric 
facilities is based on third-party engineering reports commissioned during asset acquisitions and financing activities. These 
studies are based on statistical models supported by decades of historical river flow data. Similarly, LTA for wind facilities 
is based on third-party wind resource studies completed prior to construction or acquisition. LTA for solar facilities is 
based on third-party irradiance level studies at the location of our project sites during construction or acquisition. 
• Capital expenditure forecasts rely on independent engineering reports commissioned from reputable third-party firms 
during underwriting or financings.
Our discount rates, which are adjusted based on asset level and regional considerations, are compared to those used by third-
party valuators for reasonability.
Review of our models also includes assessing comparable market transactions and reviewing third-party valuator reports. We 
compare EBITDA multiples and value per megawatt at the asset level to recent market transactions, and on a portfolio basis, 
we compare the valuation multiples to our most comparable competitors in the market and the resulting book value of our 
equity after revaluation to our share price in the market. Specifically, we have noted from reviews of market transactions in the 
U.S. northeast that the multiples paid for the asset indicate that market participants likely share our view on escalating power 
prices in the region. We also confirm the reasonability of our values through the use of a third-party valuator which provides an 
opinion on the valuation method and results. Each year we have a valuation report provided on approximately one-third of the 
assets, providing a reasonable opinion in the range of +/– 10%. We compare our valuations to this report, along with other 
inputs, ensuring that they are within the reasonable range.
In 2020, the fair value of the PP&E in our Renewable Power segment increased by $4.2 billion, primarily attributable to lower 
cost of capital applied across all classes of assets, as we observed a lowering of both interest rates and cost of equity in the 
market. Valuations also benefited from our continued cost savings and revenue enhancing initiatives.

1. The terminal capitalization rate applies only to hydroelectric assets in North America and Colombia.
Terminal values are included in the valuation of hydroelectric assets in the U.S. and Canada. For the hydroelectric assets in 
Brazil, cash flows have been included based on the duration of the authorization or useful life of a concession asset plus a    
one-time 30-year renewal term for the majority of the hydroelectric assets. The weighted-average remaining duration at 
December 31, 2020, including a one-time 30-year renewal for applicable hydroelectric assets, is 32 years (2019 – 32 years). 
Consequently, there is no terminal value attributed to the hydroelectric assets in Brazil.
Energy Contracts
The New York power contract is the only power contract that remains in place between the Corporation and BEP. Under the 
contract, we are required to purchase power that BEP generates at certain of its New York assets at a fixed price. Based on 
LTA, we purchase approximately 3,594 GWh of power each year. The fixed price that BAM is required to pay BEP will 
gradually step down over time by $3/MWh from 2021 to 2025 and $5/MWh in 2026 resulting in an approximate $20/MWh 
reduction by 2026 which will continue until the contract expires in 2046. 
The contract is valued annually based on price curves as at December 31 incorporating revised discount rates as required. 
As at December 31, 2020, the contract was valued using weighted-average forward power price estimates of approximately 
$68/MWh in years 1-10 and $138/MWh in years 11-20, using a discount rate of approximately 6.2%.
Infrastructure
Our infrastructure assets, revalued using DCF models, are generally subject to contractual and regulatory frameworks that 
underpin the cash flows. We also include the benefits of development projects for existing in-place assets to the extent that they 
have been determined to be feasible, typically by external parties, and have received the appropriate approvals. We are unable 
to include the benefits of development projects within our business that are not considered improvements to existing PP&E.
91    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
The underlying cash flow models supporting the revaluation process include a number of different inputs and variables with 
risks mitigated through controls incorporated in the bottom-up preparation and review process. Inputs are reviewed for 
qualitative and quantitative considerations and the mechanical accuracy is tested by appropriate finance and investment 
professionals. Once complete, the portfolio management team presents the valuations to the infrastructure CEO, COO and CFO 
for approval.
As part of our process, we analyze comparable market transactions that we can consider for the purposes of benchmarking our 
analysis. Metrics such as the implied current year or forward-looking EBITDA multiples are reviewed against market 
transactions to assess whether our valuations are appropriate. On an overall segment level, we also assess whether the inputs 
used in the models are consistent amongst asset classes and geographies, where applicable, or that asset specific differences are 
supportable considering transactions in a given asset class or market.
We obtain third-party appraisals on the assets that are held through private funds on a three-year rotating basis. These 
appraisals are not directly utilized in the financial statements, rather they are used to confirm that management’s assumptions in 
determining fair value are within a reasonable range.
On an aggregate basis, the value of the appraised assets is greater than the book value because a significant portion of our 
infrastructure operations assets such as public service concessions are classified as intangible assets. These intangible assets are 
carried at amortized cost, subject to impairment tests, and are amortized over their useful lives. In addition, we have contracted 
growth projects within our businesses that cannot be included in IFRS fair value unless these relate to improvements on 
existing PP&E.
Within our Infrastructure segment, we reported valuation gains of $792 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to 
revaluation gains reflecting growing cash flows and strong underlying performance at a number of businesses.
The key valuation metrics of our utilities, transport, midstream and data operations are summarized below:

Real Estate 
Fair values of our hospitality properties, primarily hotel and resort operations, are assessed annually using the depreciated 
replacement cost method, which factors in age, physical condition and construction costs of the properties. Fair values of 
hospitality properties are also reviewed in reference to each asset’s enterprise value which is determined using a discounted 
cash flow model. These valuations are generally prepared by external valuation professionals using information provided by 
management of the operating business. The fair value estimates for hospitality properties represent the estimated fair value of 
the PP&E of the hospitality business only and do not include, for example, any associated intangible assets.
Revaluation within our real estate PP&E decreased the fair value of our hospitality assets by $307 million. The decrease was 
due to provisions for impairments on certain hospitality assets which were operating at reduced occupancy levels or have been 
non-operational since the global economic shutdown began.
iii. Financial Instruments 
Financial assets, financial contracts and other contractual arrangements that are treated as derivatives are recorded at fair value 
in our financial statements and changes in their value are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on 
their nature and business purpose. The more significant and more common financial contracts and contractual arrangements 
employed in our business that are fair valued include: interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts and agreements for the 
sale of electricity. Financial assets and liabilities may be classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 6 
– Fair Value of Financial Instruments within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of financial instruments are: equity and commodity prices; future 
interest rates; the credit worthiness of the company relative to its counterparties; the credit risk of the company’s counterparties; 
estimated future cash flows; the amount of the liability and equity components of compound financial instruments; discount 
rates and volatility utilized in option valuations.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    92 
iv. Inventory 
The company estimates the net realizable value of its inventory using estimates and assumptions about future selling prices and 
future development costs. 
v. Other 
Other estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are: the 
assessment or determination of net recoverable amount; oil and gas reserves; depreciation and amortization rates and useful 
lives; estimation of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units for impairment assessments of goodwill and intangible assets; 
ability to utilize tax losses and other tax measurements; fair value of assets held as collateral and the percentage of completion 
for construction contracts. Equity accounted investment, which follow the same accounting principles as our consolidated 
operations, include amounts recorded at fair value and amounts recorded at amortized cost or cost, depending on the nature of 
the underlying assets.
Accounting Judgments 
Management is required to make critical judgments when applying its accounting policies. The following judgments have the 
most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements:
i. Control or Level of Influence 
When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the company’s investees, the company makes judgments about the 
degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. This may include 
the ability to elect investee directors or appoint management. Control is obtained when the company has the power to direct the 
relevant investing, financing and operating decisions of an entity and does so in its capacity as principal of the operations, 
rather than as an agent for other investors. Operating as a principal includes having sufficient capital at risk in any investee and 
exposure to the variability of the returns generated as a result of the decisions of the company as principal. Judgment is used 
in determining the sufficiency of the capital at risk or variability of returns. In making these judgments, the company considers 
the ability of other investors to remove the company as a manager or general partner in a controlled partnership. Refer to Part 2 
of this MD&A for additional information.
ii. Investment Properties
When applying the company’s accounting policy for investment properties, judgment is applied in determining whether certain 
costs are additions to the carrying amount of the property and, for properties under development, identifying the point at which 
practical completion of the property occurs and identifying the directly attributable borrowing costs to be included in the 
carrying value of the development property. 
iii. Property, Plant and Equipment 
The company’s accounting policy for its property, plant and equipment requires critical judgments over the assessment of 
carrying value, whether certain costs are additions to the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as opposed to 
repairs and maintenance, and for assets under development the identification of when the asset is capable of being used as 
intended and identifying the directly attributable borrowing costs to be included in the asset’s carrying value.
For assets that are measured using the revaluation method, judgment is required when estimating future prices, volumes, 
discount and capitalization rates. Judgment is applied when determining future electricity prices considering broker quotes for 
the years in which there is a liquid market available and, for the subsequent years, our best estimate of electricity prices from 
renewable sources that would allow new entrants into the market.
iv. Identifying Performance Obligations for Revenue Recognition
Management  is  required  to  identify  performance  obligations  relating  to  contracts  with  customers  at  the  inception  of 
each contract. IFRS 15 requires a contract’s transaction price to be allocated to each distinct performance obligation when, or 
as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Judgment is used when assessing the pattern of delivery of the product or service to 
determine if revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time. For certain service contracts recognized over time, 
judgment is required to determine if revenue from variable consideration such as incentives, claims and variations from 
contract modifications has met the required probability threshold to be recognized.
Management also uses judgment to determine whether contracts for the sale of products and services have distinct performance 
obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation. Goods and services are considered 
distinct if: (1) a customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily 
93    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
available to the customer; and (2) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable 
from other promises in the contract.
Additional details about revenue recognition policies across our operating segments are included in Note 3 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
v. Common Control Transactions 
The purchase and sale of businesses or subsidiaries between entities under common control are not specifically addressed in 
IFRS and accordingly, management uses judgment when determining a policy to account for such transactions taking into 
consideration other guidance in the IFRS framework and pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies. The company’s 
policy is to record assets and liabilities recognized as a result of transfers of businesses or subsidiaries between entities under 
common control at carrying value. Differences between the carrying amount of the consideration given or received and the 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities transferred are recorded directly in equity. 
vi. Indicators of Impairment 
Judgment is applied when determining whether indicators of impairment exist when assessing the carrying values of the 
company’s assets, including: the determination of the company’s ability to hold financial assets; the estimation of a cash-
generating unit’s future revenues and direct costs; the determination of discount and capitalization rates; and when an asset’s 
carrying value is above the value derived using publicly traded prices which are quoted in a liquid market.
vii. Income Taxes 
The company makes judgments when determining the future tax rates applicable to subsidiaries and identifying the temporary 
differences that relate to each subsidiary. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply during the period when the assets are realized or the liabilities settled, using the tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the consolidated balance sheet dates. The company measures deferred income taxes associated with its 
investment properties based on its specific intention with respect to each asset at the end of the reporting period. Where the 
company has a specific intention to sell a property in the foreseeable future, deferred taxes on the building portion of an 
investment property are measured based on the tax consequences that would follow the disposition of the property. Otherwise, 
deferred taxes are measured on the basis that the carrying value of the investment property will be recovered substantially 
through use.
viii.Classification of Non-Controlling Interests in Limited-Life Funds 
Non-controlling interests in limited-life funds are classified as liabilities (subsidiary equity obligations) or equity (non-
controlling interests) depending on whether an obligation exists to distribute residual net assets to non-controlling interests on 
liquidation in the form of cash or another financial asset or assets delivered in kind. Judgment is required to determine what the 
governing documents of each entity require or permit in this regard. 
ix. Other 
Other critical judgments include the determination of effectiveness of financial hedges for accounting purposes, the likelihood 
and timing of anticipated transactions for hedge accounting and the determination of functional currency.
Consolidated Financial Information
We report our financial results under IFRS while many of our peers report under U.S. GAAP. These GAAPs are aligned in 
many areas, but as it relates to asset management and investment companies, there is a significant difference between IFRS and 
U.S. GAAP. Under IFRS, while investment companies can account for their investments at fair value and report them on one 
line in their balance sheet on a net basis, a parent of an investment company cannot maintain that accounting and must look to 
whether it controls the underlying investments individually. For our peers under U.S. GAAP, investment companies can use the 
same treatment as in IFRS but the parent of an investment company would keep the same reporting as the subsidiary 
investment company. Therefore, the same investment could be fully consolidated under IFRS or shown as one line on a net 
basis under U.S. GAAP.
IFRS uses a control-based model to determine if consolidation is required. Therefore, we are deemed to control an investment 
if we: (1) exercise power over the investee; (2) are exposed to variable returns from our involvement with the investee; and (3) 
have the ability to use our power to affect the amount of the returns. Our consolidation conclusions may differ from certain of 
our peers who report under U.S. GAAP as they are required to evaluate consolidation requirements using a voting interest 
model or a variable interest model depending on the circumstances.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that such disclosure controls and 
procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020 in providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to the 
company and our consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
In the normal course of operations, we enter into transactions on market terms with related parties, including consolidated and 
equity accounted entities, which have been measured at exchange value and are recognized in the consolidated financial 
statements, including, but not limited to: manager or partnership agreements; base management fees, performance fees and 
incentive  distributions;  loans,  interest  and  non-interest  bearing  deposits;  power  purchase  and  sale  agreements;  capital 
commitments  to  private  funds;  the  acquisition  and  disposition  of  assets  and  businesses;  derivative  contracts;  and  the 
construction and development of assets.

95    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
PART 6 – BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISKS 
For purposes of Part 6 of this Report, references to the “company”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to Brookfield Asset Management 
Inc., its consolidated subsidiaries, and Oaktree.
This section contains a review of certain aspects of the business environment and risks that could materially adversely impact 
our business, performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the value of our securities. Additional risks 
and uncertainties not previously known to the company, or that the company currently deems immaterial, may also impact our 
operations and financial results.
a)  Volatility in the Trading Price of Our Class A Shares
The trading price of our Class A shares is subject to volatility due to market conditions and other factors and cannot be 
predicted.
Our shareholders may not be able to sell their Class A shares at or above the price at which they purchased such shares due to 
trading price fluctuations in the capital markets. The trading price could fluctuate significantly in response to factors both 
related and unrelated to our operating performance and/or future prospects, including, but not limited to: (i) variations in our 
operating results and financial condition; (ii) actual or prospective changes in government laws, rules or regulations affecting 
our businesses; (iii) material announcements by us, our affiliates or our competitors; (iv) the general state of the securities 
markets; (v) market conditions and events specific to the industries in which we operate; (vi) changes and developments in 
general economic, political, or social conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 and related economic disruption;           
(vii) changes in the values of our investments (including in the market price of our listed affiliates) or changes in the amount of 
distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments; (viii) differences between our actual financial and operating 
results and those expected by investors and analysts; (ix) changes in analysts’ recommendations or earnings projections;        
(x) changes in the extent of analysts’ interest in covering the Corporation and its listed affiliates; (xi) the depth and liquidity of 
the market for our Class A shares; (xii) dilution from the issuance of additional equity, including as a result of exchanges or 
additional issuances of shares exchangeable for Class A Shares such as exchanges of class A exchangeable limited voting 
shares (“BAM Reinsurance Exchangeable Shares”) of  BAM Reinsurance; (xiii) investor perception of our businesses and the 
industries in which we operate; (xiv) investment restrictions; (xv) our dividend policy; (xvi) the departure of key executives; 
(xvii) sales of Class A shares by senior management or significant shareholders; and (xviii) the materialization of other risks 
described in this section.
b)  Reputation
Actions or conduct that have a negative impact on investors’ or stakeholders’ perception of us could adversely impact our 
ability to attract and/or retain investor capital and generate fee revenue.
The growth of our asset management business relies on continuous fundraising for various private and public investment 
products, and retention of capital raised from third-party investors. We depend on our business relationships and our global 
reputation for integrity and high-caliber asset management services to attract and retain investors and advisory clients, and to 
pursue investment opportunities for us and the public and private entities we manage. Our business relationships and reputation 
could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including poor performance; actual, potential or perceived conflicts of 
interest that are not adequately addressed; misconduct or alleged misconduct by employees; rumors or innuendos; or failed or 
ineffective implementation of new investments or strategies. If we are unable to continue to raise and retain capital from third-
party investors, either privately, publicly or both, or otherwise are unable to pursue our investment opportunities, this could 
materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.
Poor performance of any kind could damage our reputation with current and potential investors in our managed entities, 
making it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors may decline to invest in current and future managed entities and 
may withdraw their investments from our managed entities as a result of poor performance in the entity in which they are 
invested, and investors in our private funds may demand lower fees for new or existing funds, all of which would decrease our 
revenue.
As a global alternative asset manager with various lines of business and investment products, some of which have overlapping 
mandates, we may be subject to a number of actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. These conflicts may be 
magnified for an asset manager that has many different capital sources available to pursue investment opportunities, including 
investor capital and the Corporation’s own capital. In addition, the senior management team of the Corporation and its affiliates 
have their own capital invested in Class A shares, directly and indirectly, and may have financial exposures with respect to their 
own investments which could lead to potential conflicts if such investments are similar to those made by the Corporation or on 
behalf of investors in entities managed by the Corporation. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    96 
In addressing these conflicts, we have implemented a variety of policies and procedures; however, there can be no assurances 
that these will be effective at mitigating actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest in all circumstances, or will not 
reduce the positive synergies that we seek to cultivate across our businesses. It is also possible that actual, potential or 
perceived conflicts of interest if not properly addressed, could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation, regulatory 
enforcement actions or other detrimental outcomes.
Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest for an asset manager like us is a priority and our reputation could be damaged if 
we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. Asset manager conflicts 
are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny in the markets in which we operate and in the U.S. in particular. Such regulatory 
scrutiny can lead to fines, penalties and other negative consequences. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, 
conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations 
in a number of ways, including an inability to adequately capitalize existing managed entities or raise new managed entities, 
including private funds, and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us. For information regarding conflicts of 
interests between the businesses within our asset management operations that operate on opposite sides of an information 
barrier, see Item (v) herein. 
Our reputation also could be negatively impacted if there is misconduct or alleged misconduct by our personnel or those of our 
portfolio companies in which we and our managed entities invest, including historical misconduct prior to our investment. 
Risks associated with misconduct at our portfolio companies is heightened in cases where we do not have legal control or 
significant influence over a particular portfolio company or are not otherwise involved in actively managing a portfolio 
company. In such situations, given our ownership position and affiliation with the portfolio company, we may still be 
negatively impacted from a reputational perspective through this association. In addition, even where we have control over a 
portfolio company, if it is a newly acquired portfolio company that we are in the process of integrating then we may face 
reputational risks related to historical or current misconduct or alleged misconduct at such portfolio company for a period of 
time. We may also face increased risk of misconduct to the extent our capital allocated to emerging markets and distressed 
companies increases. If we face allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the allegations are 
valid or invalid or whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, such allegations may result in negative 
publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the asset management industry in general, which could 
harm our reputation and may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.
We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the 
assets we manage. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees may adversely affect our partners 
and our business and reputation. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to the 
companies in which we may invest and to other third parties. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential 
information, or a security breach results in an inadvertent disclosure of such information, we could suffer serious harm to our 
reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to detect or deter employee 
misconduct or security breaches, and the precautions we take in this regard may not be effective.
Implementation of new investment and growth strategies involves a number of risks that could result in losses and harm to our 
professional reputation, including the risk that the expected results are not achieved, that new strategies are not appropriately 
planned for or integrated, that new strategies may conflict with, detract from or compete against our existing businesses, and 
that the investment process, controls and procedures that we have developed will prove insufficient or inadequate. Furthermore, 
our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that 
we may be dependent upon and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to systems, controls and personnel 
that are not under our complete control or under the control of another.
In addition to impacting our ability to raise and retain third-party capital and pursue investment opportunities, certain of the 
risks identified herein that may have a negative impact on our reputation also could, in extreme cases, result in our removal as 
general partner or an acceleration of the liquidation date of the private funds that we manage. The governing agreements of our 
private funds provide that, subject to certain conditions (which may, particularly in the case of our removal as general partner, 
include final legal adjudications of the merits of the particular issue), third-party investors in these funds will have the right to 
remove us as general partner or to accelerate the liquidation date of the fund. Additionally, at any time, investors may terminate 
a fund and accelerate the liquidation date upon the vote of a super-majority of investors in such fund. A significant negative 
impact to our reputation would be expected to increase the likelihood that investors could seek to terminate a private fund. This 
effect would be magnified if, as is often the case, an investor is invested in more than one fund. Such an event, were it to occur, 
would result in a reduction in the fees we would earn from such fund, particularly if we are unable to maximize the value of the 
fund’s investments during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a “clawback” for fees already paid out to 
us as general partner.
97    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
c)  Asset Management
Growth in fee-bearing capital could be adversely impacted by poor product development or marketing efforts. In addition, 
investment returns could be lower than target returns due to inappropriate allocation of capital or ineffective investment 
management. 
Our asset management business depends on our ability to fundraise third-party capital, deploy that capital effectively, and 
produce targeted investment returns. 
Our ability to raise third-party capital depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control such as the 
general economic environment and the number of other investment funds being raised at the same time by our competitors. 
Investors may reduce (or even eliminate) their investment allocations to alternative investments, including closed-ended private 
funds. Investors that are required to maintain specific asset class allocations within their portfolio may be required to reduce 
their investment allocations to alternative investments, particularly during periods when other asset classes such as public 
securities are decreasing in value. In addition, investors may prefer to insource and make direct investments; therefore, 
becoming competitors and ceasing to be clients and/or make new capital commitments. 
Competition from other asset managers for raising public and private capital is intense, with competition based on a variety 
of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to investors, the quality and availability of 
investment  products,  marketing  efforts,  investor  liquidity  and  willingness  to  invest,  and  reputation.  Poor  investment 
performance could hamper our ability to compete for these sources of capital or force us to reduce our management fees. Our 
investors and potential investors continually assess investment performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and 
future funds depends on our funds’ relative and absolute performance. If poor investment returns or changes in investment 
mandates prevent us from raising further capital from our existing partners, we may need to identify and attract new investors 
in order to maintain or increase the size of our private funds, and there are no assurances that we will be able to find new 
investors. Further, as competition and disintermediation in the asset management industry increases, we may face pressure to 
reduce or modify our asset management fees, including base management fees and/or carried interest, or modify other terms 
governing our current asset management fee structure, in order to attract and retain investors. 
The successful execution of our investing strategy is uncertain as it requires suitable opportunities, careful timing and business 
judgment, as well as the resources to complete asset purchases and restructure them, if required, notwithstanding difficulties 
experienced in a particular industry.
There is no certainty that we will be able to identify suitable or sufficient opportunities that meet our investment criteria and be 
able to acquire additional high-quality assets at attractive prices to supplement our growth in a timely manner, or at all. In 
pursuing investment opportunities and returns, we and our managed entities face competition from other investment managers 
and investors worldwide. Each of our businesses is subject to competition in varying degrees and our competitors may have 
certain competitive advantages over us when pursuing investment opportunities. Some of our competitors may have higher risk 
tolerances, different risk assessments, lower return thresholds, a lower cost of capital, or a lower effective tax rate (or no tax 
rate at all), all of which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for 
investments. We may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices, structures and terms 
offered by our competitors, some of whom may have synergistic businesses which allow them to consider bidding a higher 
price than we can reasonably offer. While we attempt to deal with competitive pressures by leveraging our asset management 
strengths and operating capabilities and compete on more than just price, there is no guarantee these measures will be 
successful, and we may have difficulty competing for investment opportunities, particularly those offered through auction or 
other competitive processes. If we are unable to successfully raise, retain, and deploy third-party capital into investments, we 
may be unable to collect management fees, carried interest or transaction fees, which would materially reduce our revenue and 
cash flows and adversely affect our financial condition. 
Our approach to investing often entails adding assets to our existing businesses when the competition for assets is weakest; 
typically, when depressed economic conditions exist in the market relating to a particular entity or industry. Such an investing 
style carries with it inherent risks when investments are made in either markets or industries that are undergoing some form of 
dislocation. We may fail to value opportunities accurately or to consider all relevant factors that may be necessary or helpful in 
evaluating an opportunity, may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquisition up to standards established for its 
intended market position, may be exposed to unexpected risks and costs associated with our investments, including risks arising 
from alternative technologies that could impair or eliminate the competitive advantage of our business in a particular industry, 
and/or may be unable to quickly and effectively integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations or exit from the 
investment on favorable terms. In addition, liabilities may exist that we or our managed entities do not discover in due diligence 
prior to the consummation of an acquisition, or circumstances may exist with respect to the entities or assets acquired that could 
lead to future liabilities and, in each case, we or our managed entities may not be entitled to sufficient, or any, recourse against 
the contractual counterparties to an acquisition. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    98 
We generally pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal and other complexities. Our tolerance for 
complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time consuming to finance and execute, 
and have a higher risk of execution failure. It can also be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in 
such transactions and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent 
liabilities. 
At times, we make investments (for one or more of our funds or managed entities) in companies that we do not control. These 
investments are subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or 
management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may 
take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. 
Certain of our investments may be concentrated in particular asset types or geographic regions, which could exacerbate any 
negative performance of one or more of our managed entities to the extent those concentrated investments are in assets or 
regions that experience a market dislocation. In addition, certain of our funds hold publicly traded securities the price of which 
will be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control, including actual or anticipated changes 
in the profitability of the issuers of such securities; general economic, social, or political developments; changes in industry 
conditions; changes in governance regulation; inflation; the general state of the securities markets; COVID-19; and other 
material events.
Some of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development and implementation of new or alternative 
technology that impacts the demand for, or use of, the businesses or assets that we own and operate. These pressures could 
reduce investment returns and negatively affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The failure of a newly acquired business to perform according to expectations could have a material adverse effect on our 
assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Alternatively, we may be required to sell a 
business before it has realized our expected level of returns for such business. 
If any of our managed investments perform poorly or experience prolonged periods of volatility, or we are unable to deploy 
capital effectively, our fee-based revenue, cash available for distribution and/or carried interest would decline. Moreover, we 
could experience losses on our capital invested in our managed entities. Accordingly, our expected returns on these investments 
may be less than we have assumed in forecasting the value of our business. 
d)  Laws, Rules and Regulations
We are subject to numerous laws, rules, and regulatory requirements which may impact our business, including resulting in 
financial penalties, loss of business, and/or damage to our reputation in instances of non-compliance.
There are many laws, governmental rules and regulations and listing exchange rules that apply to us, our affiliates, our assets 
and our businesses. Changes in these laws, rules and regulations, or their interpretation by governmental agencies or the courts, 
could adversely affect our business, assets or prospects, or those of our affiliates, customers, clients or partners. The failure of 
us, our listed affiliates, or the entities that we manage to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, or with the rules and 
registration requirements of the respective stock exchanges on which we and they are listed could adversely affect our 
reputation and financial condition.
Our asset management business, including our investment advisory and broker-dealer business, is subject to substantial and 
increasing regulatory compliance obligations and oversight, and this higher level of scrutiny may lead to more regulatory 
enforcement actions. There continues to be uncertainty regarding the appropriate level of regulation and oversight of asset 
management businesses in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate. The financial services industry has been the subject 
of heightened scrutiny, and the SEC has specifically focused on asset managers in recent enforcement actions. Regulatory 
investigations and/or enforcement actions by our regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or 
reputation. In addition, the introduction of new legislation and increased regulation may result in increased compliance costs 
and could materially affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability. Although there 
may be some areas where governments in certain jurisdictions have proposed deregulation, it is difficult to predict the timing 
and impact of any such deregulation, and we may not materially benefit from any such changes. 
Our asset management business is not only regulated in the U.S., but also in other jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
including the EU, the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Hong Kong. Similar to the environment in the U.S., the current 
environment in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we operate has become subject to further regulation. Governmental 
agencies around the world have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could 
adversely affect our asset management business, and governmental agencies may propose or implement further rules and 
regulations in the future. These rules and regulations may impact how we market our managed entities in these jurisdictions 
and  introduce  compliance  obligations  with  respect  to  disclosure  and  transparency,  as  well  as  restrictions  on  investor 
distributions. Such regulations may also prescribe certain capital requirements on our managed entities, and conditions on the 
99    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
leverage our managed entities may employ and the liquidity these managed entities must have. Compliance with additional 
regulatory requirements will impose additional compliance burdens and expense for us and could reduce our operating 
flexibility and fundraising opportunities.
Our broker-dealer business is regulated by the SEC, the various Canadian provincial securities commissions, as well as self-
regulatory organizations. These regulatory bodies may conduct administrative or enforcement proceedings that can result in 
censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its directors, officers or employees. Such proceedings, whether or not 
resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation of a 
broker dealer.
The advisors of certain of our managed entities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Registered investment 
advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which grants U.S. supervisory 
agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply 
with laws or regulations. If such powers are exercised, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of 
individual employees, limitations on the activities in which the investment advisor may engage, suspension or revocation of the 
investment  advisor’s  registration,  censure  and  fines.  Compliance  with  these  requirements  and  regulations  results  in 
the expenditure of resources, and a failure to comply could result in investigations, financial or other sanctions, and reputational 
damage.
The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “40 Act”) and the rules promulgated thereunder provide certain protections to 
investors and impose certain restrictions on entities that are deemed “investment companies” under the 40 Act. We are not 
currently, nor do we intend to become, registered as an investment company under the 40 Act. To ensure that we are 
not deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to materially restrict or limit the scope of our operations or plans 
and the types of acquisitions that we may make, and we may need to modify our organizational structure or dispose of assets 
that we would not otherwise dispose of. If we were required to register as an investment company, we would, among other 
things, be restricted from engaging in certain business activities (or have conditions placed on our business activities) and 
issuing certain securities, be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as principal and face other limitations on 
our activities.
We have and may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and 
investment platform which likely will carry additional legal and compliance costs, as well as additional operating requirements 
that may also increase costs. 
We acquire and develop primarily real estate, renewable power, infrastructure, business services and industrial assets. In doing 
so, we must comply with extensive and complex municipal, state or provincial, national and international regulations. These 
regulations can result in uncertainty and delays, and impose on us additional costs, which may adversely affect our results of 
operations. Changes in these laws may negatively impact us and our businesses or may benefit our competitors or their 
businesses.
Additionally, liability under such laws, rules and regulations may occur without our fault. In certain cases, parties can pursue 
legal actions against us to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for non-compliance or for personal injury or property 
damage. Our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event that a successful claim is made against us.
e)  Governmental Investigations and Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, including anti-bribery and corruption laws, 
may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations and as a result we may be subject to related governmental 
investigations.
We are from time to time subject to various governmental investigations, audits and inquiries, both formal and informal. These 
investigations, regardless of their outcome, can be costly, divert management attention, and damage our reputation. The 
unfavorable resolution of such investigations could result in criminal liability, fines, penalties or other monetary or non-
monetary sanctions and could materially affect our business or results of operations.
There is an increasing global focus on the implementation and enforcement of anti-bribery and corruption legislation, and this 
focus has heightened the risks that we face in this area, particularly as we continue to expand our operations globally. We are 
subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other third parties, 
including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the 
U.K. Bribery Act, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and the Brazilian Clean Company Act. This 
increased global focus on anti-bribery and corruption enforcement may also lead to more investigations, both formal and 
informal, in this area, the results of which cannot be predicted.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    100 
Different laws and regulations that are applicable to us may contain conflicting provisions, making our compliance more 
difficult. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, 
reputational harm, incarceration of our employees, restrictions on our operations and other liabilities, which could negatively 
affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be subject to successor liability for violations under 
these laws and regulations or other acts of bribery committed by entities in which we or our managed entities invest.
Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, in 
particular when conducting due diligence in connection with acquisitions, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be 
widespread in certain jurisdictions. We invest in emerging market countries that may not have established stringent anti-bribery 
and corruption laws and regulations, where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced, or that are 
perceived to have materially higher levels of corruption according to international rating standards. Due diligence on 
investment opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more challenging because consistent and uniform commercial 
practices in such locations may not have developed or do not meet international standards. Bribery, fraud, accounting 
irregularities and corrupt practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations. When acquiring assets in distress, the 
quality of financial information of the target may also make it difficult to identify irregularities.
f)  Financial and Liquidity
Cash may not be available to meet our financial obligations when due or enable us to capitalize on investment opportunities 
when they arise.
We employ debt and other forms of leverage in the ordinary course of business to enhance returns to our investors and finance 
our operations. We are therefore subject to the risks associated with debt financing and refinancing, including but not limited to 
the following: (i) our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; (ii) payments of 
principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pay operating expenses and dividends; 
(iii) if we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at high interest rates 
or on other unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than 
would otherwise be the case; (iv) we may not be able to refinance indebtedness at maturity due to company and market factors 
such as the estimated cash flow produced by our assets, the value of our assets, liquidity in the debt markets, and/or financial, 
competitive, business and other factors; and (v) if we are able to refinance our indebtedness, the terms of a refinancing may not 
be as favorable as the original terms for such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, 
or at all, we may need to utilize available liquidity, which would reduce our ability to pursue new investment opportunities, or 
we may need to dispose of one or more of our assets on disadvantageous terms, or raise equity, thereby causing dilution to 
existing shareholders. Regulatory changes may also result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to credit. 
The terms of our various credit agreements and other financing documents require us to comply with a number of customary 
financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios, adequate insurance coverage and 
certain credit ratings. These covenants may limit our flexibility in conducting our operations and breaches of these covenants 
could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, even if we have satisfied and continue to 
satisfy our payment obligations.
A large proportion of our capital is invested in physical assets and securities that can be hard to sell, especially if market 
conditions are poor. Further, because our investment strategy can entail our having representation on public portfolio company 
boards, we may be restricted in our ability to effect sales during certain time periods. A lack of liquidity could limit our ability 
to vary our portfolio or assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, if financial or 
operating difficulties of other owners result in distress sales, such sales could depress asset values in the markets in which we 
operate. The restrictions inherent in owning physical assets could reduce our ability to respond to changes in market conditions 
and could adversely affect the performance of our investments, our financial condition and results of operations.
Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid or non-public investments, 
the fair values of such investments do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained when such 
investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been recorded 
would result in losses, a decline in asset management fees and the potential loss of carried interest and incentive fees.
We enter into financing commitments in the normal course of business, which we may be required to fund. Additionally, from 
time to time, we may guarantee the obligations of other entities that we manage and/or invest in. If we are required to fund 
these commitments and are unable to do so, this could result in damages being pursued against us or a loss of opportunity 
through default under contracts that are otherwise to our benefit.
101    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
g)  Foreign Exchange and Other Financial Exposures
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely impact our aggregate foreign currency exposure and hedging strategies 
may not be effective.
We have pursued and intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets, and often invest in countries 
where the U.S. dollar is not the local currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations 
in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency utilized 
in one or more countries where we have a significant presence may have a material adverse effect on the results of our 
operations and financial position. In addition, we are active in certain markets whose economic growth is dependent on the 
price of commodities and the currencies in these markets can be more volatile as a result.
Our businesses are impacted by changes in currency rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other financial exposures. We 
selectively utilize financial instruments to manage these exposures, including credit default swaps and other derivatives to 
hedge certain of our financial positions. However, a significant portion of these risks may remain unhedged. We may also 
choose to establish unhedged positions in the ordinary course of business.
There is no assurance that hedging strategies, to the extent they are used, will fully mitigate the risks they are intended to offset. 
Additionally, derivatives that we use are also subject to their own unique set of risks, including counterparty risk with respect to 
the financial well-being of the party on the other side of these transactions and a potential requirement to fund mark-to-market 
adjustments. Our financial risk management policies may not ultimately be effective at managing these risks.
The Dodd-Frank Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions impose rules and regulations governing oversight of the over-the-
counter derivatives market and its participants. These regulations may impose additional costs and regulatory scrutiny on us. If 
our derivative transactions are required to be executed through exchanges or regulated facilities, we will face incremental 
collateral requirements in the form of initial margin and require variation margin to be cash settled on a daily basis. Such an 
increase in margin requirements (relative to bilateral agreements), were it to occur, perhaps combined with a more restricted list 
of securities that qualify as eligible collateral, would require us to hold larger positions in cash and treasuries, which could 
reduce income. We cannot predict the effect of changing derivatives legislation on our hedging costs, our hedging strategy or 
its implementation, or the risks that we hedge. Regulation of derivatives may increase the cost of derivative contracts, reduce 
the availability of derivatives to protect against operational risk and reduce the liquidity of the derivatives market, all of which 
may reduce our use of derivatives  and result in the increased volatility and decreased predictability of our cash flows.
h)  Temporary Investments
We may be unable to syndicate, assign or transfer financial commitments entered into in support of our asset management 
franchise.
We periodically enter into agreements that commit us to acquire assets or securities in order to support our asset management 
franchise with the expectation that our commitment is temporary. For example, we may acquire an asset suitable for a 
particular managed entity that we are fundraising and warehouse that asset through the fundraising period before transferring 
the asset to the managed entity for which it was intended. Or, as another example, for a particular acquisition transaction we 
may commit capital as part of a consortium alongside certain of our managed entities with the expectation that we will 
syndicate or assign all or a portion of our own commitment to other investors prior to, at the same time as, or subsequent to, the 
anticipated closing of the transaction. In all of these cases, our support is intended to be of a temporary nature and we engage in 
this  activity  in  order  to  further  the  growth  and  development  of  our  asset  management  franchise.  By  leveraging  the 
Corporation’s financial position to make temporary investments, we can execute on investment opportunities prior to obtaining 
all third-party equity financing that we seek, and these opportunities may otherwise not be available without the Corporation’s 
initial equity participation.
While it is often our intention in these arrangements that the Corporation’s direct participation be of a temporary nature, we 
may be unable to syndicate, assign or transfer our interest as we intended and therefore may be required to take or keep 
ownership of an asset for an extended period. This would increase the amount of our own capital deployed to certain assets and 
could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, which may reduce our ability to pursue further acquisitions or meet other 
financial commitments.
i)  Interest Rates
Rising interest rates could increase our interest costs and adversely affect our financial performance.
A number of our long-life assets are interest rate sensitive. Increases in interest rates will, other things being equal, decrease the 
value of an asset by reducing the present value of the cash flows expected to be produced by such asset. As the value of an asset 
declines as a result of interest rate increases, certain financial and other covenants under credit agreements governing such 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    102 
asset could be breached, even if we have satisfied and continue to satisfy our payment obligations thereunder. Such a breach 
could result in negative consequences on our financial performance and results of operations.
Additionally, any of our debt or preferred shares that are subject to variable interest rates, either as an obligation with a variable 
interest rate or as an obligation with a fixed interest rate that resets into a variable interest rate in the future, are subject to 
interest rate risk. Further, the value of any debt or preferred share that is subject to a fixed interest rate will be determined based 
on the prevailing interest rates and, accordingly, this type of debt or preferred share is also subject to interest rate risk.
In addition, interest rates currently remain at low levels in many jurisdictions in which we operate. These rates may remain 
relatively low, but they may rise significantly at some point in the future, either gradually or abruptly. A sudden or unexpected 
increase in interest rates may cause certain market dislocations that could negatively impact our financial performance. Interest 
rate increases would also increase the amount of cash required to service our obligations and our earnings could be adversely 
impacted as a result thereof.
The Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. has announced that it will cease to compel banks to participate in LIBOR after 
2021. LIBOR is widely used as a benchmark rate around the world for derivative financial instruments, bonds, and other 
floating-rate instruments. This change to the administration of LIBOR, and any other reforms to benchmark interest rates, could 
create risks and challenges for us, the entities that we manage, and our portfolio companies. For example, the gradual 
elimination of LIBOR rates may have an impact on over-the-counter derivative transactions including potential contract 
repricing. In addition, the discontinuance of, or changes to, benchmark interest rates may require adjustments to agreements to 
which we and other market participants are parties, as well as to related systems and processes.
j)  Human Capital
Ineffective maintenance of our culture, or ineffective management of human capital could adversely impact our asset 
management business and financial performance.
Our ability to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and 
motivate our existing employees. Our senior management team has a significant role in our success and oversees the execution 
of our value investing strategy. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees this could limit our ability to compete 
successfully and achieve our business objectives, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of 
operations.
Our ability to retain and motivate our management team, attract suitable replacements should any members of our management 
team leave, or attract new investment professionals as our business grows, is dependent on, among other things, the competitive 
nature of the employment market and the career opportunities and compensation that we can offer. In all of our markets, we 
face intense competition in connection with the attraction and retention of qualified employees. 
We may experience departures of key professionals in the future. We cannot predict the impact that any such departures will 
have on our ability to achieve our objectives. Our senior management team possesses substantial experience and expertise and 
has strong business relationships with investors in our managed entities and other members of the business communities 
and industries in which we operate. As a result, the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in 
our managed entities and other members of the business communities and industries in which we operate and result in the 
reduction of our assets under management or fewer investment opportunities. Accordingly, the loss of services from key 
professionals or a limitation in their availability could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow. Furthermore, 
such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets. 
Additionally, the departure of certain individuals could trigger certain “key person” provisions in the documentation governing 
certain of our private funds, which would permit the limited partners of those funds to suspend or terminate the funds’ 
investment periods or withdraw their capital prior to the expiration of the applicable lock-up date. Our key person provisions 
vary by both strategy and fund and, with respect to each strategy and fund, are typically tied to multiple individuals, meaning 
that it would require the departure of more than one individual to trigger the key person provisions. Our human capital risks 
may be exacerbated by the fact that we do not maintain any key person insurance. 
The conduct of our businesses and the execution of our strategy rely heavily on teamwork. Our continued ability to respond 
promptly to opportunities and challenges as they arise depends on co-operation and co-ordination across our organization and 
our team-oriented management structure, which may not materialize in the way we expect.
A portion of the workforce in some of our businesses is unionized. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective 
bargaining agreements with any of our unions as existing agreements expire we could experience a work stoppage, which could 
result in a significant disruption to the affected operations, higher ongoing labor costs and restrictions on our ability to 
maximize the efficiency of our operations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
103    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
k)  Geopolitical
Political instability, changes in government policy, or unfamiliar cultural factors could adversely impact the value of our 
investments.
We are subject to geopolitical uncertainties in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We make investments in businesses that are 
based outside of North America and we may pursue investments in unfamiliar markets, which may expose us to additional risks 
not typically associated with investing in North America. We may not properly adjust to the local culture and business practices 
in such markets, and there is the prospect that we may hire personnel or partner with local persons who might not comply with 
our culture and ethical business practices; either scenario could result in the failure of our initiatives in new or existing markets 
and lead to financial losses for us and our managed entities. There are risks of political instability in several of our major 
markets and in other parts of the world in which we conduct business from factors such as political conflict, income inequality, 
refugee migration, terrorism, the potential break-up of political-economic unions (or the departure of a union member – e.g., 
Brexit) and political corruption; the materialization of one or more of these risks could negatively affect our financial 
performance. 
On January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the EU. Following its withdrawal from the EU, the U.K. entered into a transition 
period, during which EU law continued to apply in the U.K. while the U.K. government and the EU negotiated the terms of 
their future relationship. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020, and EU law no longer applies in the U.K. The 
U.K. and the EU have agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement pursuant to which there will be no tariffs or quotas on goods 
traded between the U.K. or the EU. However, services are not comprehensively covered in the agreement and negotiations are 
ongoing in relation to provision of financial services in particular. It is difficult to predict what the future economic, tax, fiscal, 
legal, regulatory and other implications will be for the asset management industry, the broader European and global financial 
markets generally. While we have not experienced any material financial impact from Brexit on our business to date, we cannot 
predict its future implications and it may result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potentially higher 
costs of conducting business in Europe, which may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Any existing or new operations may be subject to significant political, economic and financial risks, which vary by country, 
and may include: (i) changes in government policies, including protectionist policies, or personnel; (ii) changes in general 
economic or social conditions, including as a result of COVID-19; (iii) restrictions on currency transfer or convertibility; 
(iv) changes in labor relations; (v) political instability and civil unrest; (vi) less developed or efficient financial markets than in 
North America; (vii) the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure 
requirements; (viii) less government supervision and regulation; (ix) a less developed legal or regulatory environment; 
(x) heightened exposure to corruption risk; (xi) political hostility to investments by foreign investors; (xii) less publicly 
available information in respect of companies in non-North American markets; (xiii) adversely higher or lower rates of 
inflation; (xiv) higher transaction costs; (xv) difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations and expropriation or confiscation 
of assets; and (xvi) fewer investor protections.
In addition to the risks noted above, as a result of the rapid spread of COVID-19, many governments have imposed restrictions 
on business activity and travel. Refer to Catastrophic Event/Loss, Climate Change, and Terrorism on pages 105 and 106.
Unforeseen political events in markets where we have significant investors and/or where we own and operate assets or may 
look to for further growth of our businesses, such as the U.S., Canadian, Brazilian, Australian, European, Middle Eastern and 
Asian markets, may create economic uncertainty that has a negative impact on our financial performance. Such uncertainty 
could cause disruptions to our businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with our investors, 
customers and suppliers, as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies, including the value of the British 
pound and the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect our financial condition, 
operating results and cash flows. In addition, political outcomes in the markets in which we operate may also result in legal 
uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, which can contribute to general economic uncertainty. 
Economic uncertainty impacting us and our managed entities could be exacerbated by near-term political events, including 
those in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Europe, Middle East, Australia, Asia and elsewhere.
l)  Economic Conditions
Unfavorable economic conditions or changes in the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our financial 
performance.
We are exposed to local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences beyond our 
control, including, but not limited to, the following: credit and capital market volatility; business investment levels; government 
spending levels; consumer spending levels; changes in laws, rules or regulations; trade barriers; commodity prices; currency 
exchange rates and controls; national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts, or security 
operations); catastrophic events (including pandemics/epidemics such as COVID-19, earthquakes, tornadoes, or floods); 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    104 
changes in interest rates; inflation rates; the rate and direction of economic growth; and general economic uncertainty. On a 
global basis, certain industries and sectors have created capacity that anticipated higher growth, which has caused volatility 
across  all  markets,  including  commodity  markets,  which  may  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  financial  performance. 
Unfavorable economic conditions could affect the jurisdictions in which our entities are formed and where we own assets and 
operate businesses, and may cause a reduction in: (i) securities prices; (ii) the liquidity of investments made by us and our 
managed entities; (iii) the value or performance of the investments made by us and our managed entities; and (iv) the ability of 
us and our managed entities to raise or deploy capital, each of which could adversely impact our financial condition.
In general, a decline in economic conditions, either in the markets or industries in which we participate, or both, will result in 
downward pressure on our operating margins and asset values as a result of lower demand and increased price competition for 
the services and products that we provide. In particular, given the importance of the U.S. to our operations, an economic 
downturn in this market could have a significant adverse effect on our operating margins and asset values.
Many of our private funds have a finite life that may require us to exit an investment made in a fund at an inopportune time. 
Volatility in the exit markets for these investments, increasing levels of capital required to finance companies to exit and rising 
enterprise value thresholds to go public or complete a strategic sale can all contribute to the risk that we will not be able to exit 
a private fund investment successfully. We cannot always control the timing of our private fund investment exits or our 
realizations upon exit.
If global economic conditions deteriorate, our investment performance could suffer, resulting in, for example, the payment of 
less or no carried interest to us. The payment of less or no carried interest to us could cause our cash flow from operations to 
decrease, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and the amount of cash we have on hand to conduct our 
operations. A reduction in our cash flow from operations could, in turn, require us to rely on other sources of cash such as the 
capital markets which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or debt and other forms of leverage.
In addition, in an economic downturn, there is an increased risk of default by counterparties to our investments and other 
transactions. In these circumstances, it is more likely that such transactions will fail or perform poorly, which may in turn have 
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.
m)  Catastrophic Event/Loss, Climate Change, and Terrorism 
Catastrophic events (or combination of events), such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, pandemics/epidemics such as 
COVID-19, terrorism/sabotage, or fire, could adversely impact our financial performance.
Our assets under management could be exposed to effects of catastrophic events, such as severe weather conditions, natural 
disasters, major accidents, pandemics/epidemics such as COVID-19, acts of malicious destruction, sabotage, war or terrorism, 
which could materially adversely impact our operations.
A local, regional, national or international outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19 which has spread across the 
globe at a rapid pace impacting global commercial activity and travel, may adversely affect trade and global and local 
economies, and could negatively impact clients and our businesses. 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to COVID-19. COVID-19 has spread 
globally, and actions taken in response to COVID-19 by government authorities across various geographies in which the 
company owns and operates investments have interrupted business activities and supply chains; disrupted travel; contributed to 
significant volatility in the financial markets and lower interest rates; impacted social conditions; and adversely impacted local, 
regional, national and international economic conditions, as well as the labor market. As a result of the rapid spread of 
COVID-19, many companies and various governments have imposed restrictions on business activity and travel which may 
continue and could expand. To date, there have been restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions and the global 
movement of people and certain goods. Responses have included mandatory temporary closure of, or imposed limitations on, 
the operations of certain non-essential properties and businesses including office properties and retail malls and associated 
businesses which operate within these properties such as retailers and restaurants. In addition, shelter-in-place mandates and 
severe travel restrictions have had an adverse impact on consumer spending and demand. Governments and central banks 
around the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
various other response measures, however, the overall magnitude and long-term effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain. 
Our asset management operations, as well as many of our portfolio companies, continue to operate in accordance with their 
business continuity plans and local restrictions, including, in many instances, with employees continuing to work remotely. 
Business has slowed around the globe including in certain of our operations, such as our malls, and there can be no assurance 
that strategies to address potential disruptions in operations will mitigate the adverse impacts related to the outbreak.
Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19, it is difficult to predict how significant 
the impact of this coronavirus outbreak, including any responses to it, will be on the global economy, our clients, and our 
businesses or for how long disruptions are likely to continue. The company continues to closely monitor developments related 
105    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
to the pandemic in light of the economic environment. The longer-term impacts of the restrictions will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain, constantly evolving and difficult to predict. These impacts may differ in magnitude 
depending on a number of scenarios, which we continue to monitor and take into consideration in our decision making as we 
continue to assess medium to long-term impacts. Additional actions may be taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, 
such as re-imposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions. The pace, availability, distribution 
and acceptance of effective vaccines could also affect the impact of COVID-19. Such developments, depending on their nature, 
duration, and intensity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows. 
In addition, a pandemic affecting our employees or employees of Brookfield Asset Management that provide services to us 
under the Administration Agreement, the employees of our subsidiaries, reinsurers, if any, or the employees of other companies 
with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental 
and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on 
the adverse effects we experience. These events, which are beyond our control, could cause a material adverse effect on our 
results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial 
condition.
Turbulence in the financial markets due to the spread of COVID-19 may limit our ability to access the credit or equity markets. 
Moreover, changes in interest rates, reduced liquidity or a continued slowdown in global economic conditions may also 
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. If we were to decide in the future 
to raise capital through equity financings, the interest of our shareholders may be diluted, and the securities we issue may have 
rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares. Further, extreme market volatility may leave 
us unable to react to market events in a prudent manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly 
markets.
The global spread of COVID-19, or future public health crises, epidemics or pandemics could materially and adversely affect 
our results of operations and financial condition due to the disruptions to commerce, reduced economic activity and other 
unforeseen consequences of a pandemic that are beyond our control.
Ongoing changes to the physical climate in which we operate may have an impact on our businesses. Changes in weather 
patterns or extreme weather (such as floods, hurricanes and other storms) may impact hydrology and/or wind levels, thereby 
influencing power generation levels, affect other of our businesses or damage our assets. Further, rising sea levels could, in the 
future, affect the value of any low-lying coastal real assets that we may own or develop, result in the imposition of new 
property taxes or increase property insurance rates. Climate change may also give rise to changes in regulations and consumer 
sentiment that could have a negative impact on our operations by increasing the costs of operating our business or reducing 
demand for our products and services. The adverse effects of climate change and related regulation at provincial or state, 
federal and international levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or 
cash flows. 
Our commercial office portfolio is concentrated in large metropolitan areas, some of which have been or may be perceived to 
be threatened by terrorist attacks or acts of war. Furthermore, many of our properties consist of high-rise buildings which may 
also be subject to this actual or perceived threat. The perceived threat of a terrorist attack or outbreak of war could negatively 
impact our ability to lease office space in our real estate portfolio. Renewable power and infrastructure assets such as roads, 
railways, power generation facilities and ports, may also be targeted by terrorist organizations or in acts of war. Any damage or 
business interruption costs as a result of uninsured or underinsured acts of terrorism or war could result in a material cost to us 
and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. Adequate terrorism insurance may not be 
available at rates we believe to be reasonable in the future. These risks could be heightened by foreign policy decisions of the 
U.S. (where we have significant operations) and other influential countries or general geopolitical conditions.
Additionally, our businesses rely on free movement of goods, services, and capital from around the globe. Any slowdown in 
international investment, business, or trade as a result of catastrophic events, including COVID-19, also could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
n)  Tax
Reassessments by tax authorities or changes in tax laws could create additional tax costs for us.
Our structure is based on prevailing taxation law and practice in the local jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in 
tax policy, tax legislation (including in relation to taxation rates), the interpretation of tax policy or legislation or practice 
in these jurisdictions could adversely affect the return we earn on our investments, the level of capital available to be invested 
by us or our managed entities and the willingness of investors to invest in our managed entities. This risk would include any 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    106 
reassessments by tax authorities on our tax returns if we were to incorrectly interpret or apply any tax policy, legislation or 
practice.
Taxes and other constraints that would apply to our operating entities in such jurisdictions may not apply to local institutions or 
other parties such as state-owned enterprises, and such parties may therefore have a significantly lower effective cost of capital 
and a corresponding competitive advantage in pursuing acquisitions. There are a number of factors that could increase our 
effective tax rates, which would have a negative impact on our net income, including, but not limited to, changes in the 
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any reassessment of taxes by a taxation authority.
Governments around the world are increasingly seeking to regulate multinational companies and their use of differential tax 
rates between jurisdictions. This effort includes a greater emphasis by various nations to co-ordinate and share information 
regarding companies and the taxes they pay. Governmental taxation policies and practices could adversely affect us and, 
depending on the nature of such policies and practices, could have a greater impact on us than on other companies. As a result 
of this increased focus on the use of tax planning by multinational companies, our tax planning could be subject to negative 
media coverage which may adversely impact our reputation.
The Corporation endeavors to be considered a “qualified foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for the 
Corporation’s dividends to therefore be considered generally eligible for “qualified dividend” treatment in the U.S. Whether 
dividends paid by the Corporation will in fact be treated as “qualified dividends” for U.S. federal income tax purposes for a 
particular shareholder of the Corporation will depend on that shareholder’s specific circumstances, including, but not limited to, 
the shareholder’s holding period for shares of the Corporation on which dividends are received. The Corporation provides no 
assurances that any or all of its dividends paid to shareholders will be treated as “qualified dividends” for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes.
o)  Financial Reporting and Disclosures
Deficiencies in our public company financial reporting and disclosures could adversely impact our reputation.
As we expand the size and scope of our business, there is a greater susceptibility that our financial reporting and other public 
disclosure documents may contain material misstatements and that the controls we maintain to attempt to ensure the complete 
accuracy of our public disclosures may fail to operate as intended. The occurrence of such events could adversely impact our 
reputation and financial condition. In addition, we disclose certain metrics that do not have standardized meaning and are based 
on our own methodologies and assumptions, and which may not properly convey the information they purport to reflect.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting to give our 
stakeholders assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with IFRS. However, the process for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls 
over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error. Our internal controls over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial disclosures on a timely basis, or at all. Some of these 
processes may be new for certain subsidiaries in our structure and in the case of acquisitions may take time to be fully 
implemented.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in 
reports filed or submitted under Canadian and U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the 
time periods specified. Our policies and procedures governing disclosures may not ensure that all material information 
regarding us is disclosed in a proper and timely fashion, or that we will be successful in preventing the disclosure of material 
information to a single person or a limited group of people before such information is generally disseminated.
p)  Health, Safety and the Environment
Inadequate or ineffective health and safety programs could result in injuries to employees or the public and, as with ineffective 
management of environmental and sustainability issues, could damage our reputation, adversely impact our financial 
performance and may lead to regulatory action.
The ownership and operation of some of the assets held in our portfolio companies carry varying degrees of inherent risk or 
liability related to worker health and safety and the environment, including the risk of government-imposed orders to remedy 
unsafe conditions and contaminated lands and potential civil liability. Compliance with health, safety and environmental 
standards and the requirements set out in the relevant licenses, permits and other approvals obtained by the portfolio companies 
is crucial.
Our portfolio companies have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with 
health, safety and environmental standards, to obtain and comply with licenses, permits and other approvals, and to assess and 
manage potential liability exposure. Nevertheless, they may be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining an important license, 
107    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
permit or other approval or become subject to government orders, investigations, inquiries or other proceedings (including civil 
claims) relating to health, safety and environmental matters, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Health, safety and environmental laws and regulations can change rapidly and significantly, and we and/or our portfolio 
companies may become subject to more stringent laws and regulations in the future. The occurrence of any adverse health, 
safety or environmental event, or any changes, additions to, or more rigorous enforcement of, health, safety and environmental 
standards, licenses, permits or other approvals could have a significant impact on operations and/or result in material 
expenditures.
Owners and operators of real assets may become liable for the costs of removal and remediation of certain hazardous 
substances released or deposited on or in their properties, or at other locations regardless of whether or not the owner and 
operator caused the release or deposit of such hazardous materials. These costs could be significant and could reduce cash 
available for our businesses. The failure to remove or remediate such substances, if any, could adversely affect our ability to 
sell our assets or to borrow using these assets as collateral, and could potentially result in claims or other proceedings.
Certain of our businesses are involved in using, handling or transporting substances that are toxic, combustible or otherwise 
hazardous to the environment and may be in close proximity to environmentally sensitive areas or densely populated 
communities. If a leak, spill or other environmental incident occurred, it could result in substantial fines or penalties being 
imposed by regulatory authorities, revocation of licenses or permits required to operate the business, the imposition of more 
stringent conditions in those licenses or permits or legal claims for compensation (including punitive damages) by affected 
stakeholders.
There is increasing stakeholder interest in environment, social and governance (“ESG”) factors and how they are managed. 
ESG factors include climate change, human capital and labor management, corporate governance, gender diversity and privacy 
and data security, among others. Increasingly, investors and lenders are incorporating ESG factors into their investment or 
lending process, respectively, alongside traditional financial considerations. Investors or potential investors in our managed 
entities or in Brookfield may not invest given certain industries in which we operate. If we are unable to successfully integrate 
ESG factors into our practices, we may incur a higher cost of capital or lower interest in our debt and/or equity securities.
Global ESG challenges such as carbon footprints, privacy and data security, demographic shifts and regulatory pressures are 
introducing new risk factors for us that we may not have dealt with previously. If we are unable to successfully manage our 
ESG compliance, this could have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to raise future public and private capital, 
and could be detrimental to our economic value and the value of our managed entities.
q)  Data Security, Privacy, and Cyber-Terrorism 
Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology systems could have a material adverse effect on us. 
We rely on certain information and technology systems, including the systems of others with whom we do business, which may 
be subject to security breaches or cyber-terrorism intended to obtain unauthorized access to proprietary information or 
personally identifiable information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage these systems, through the introduction of 
computer viruses, fraudulent emails, cyber-attacks or other means. Such acts of cyber-terrorism could originate from a variety 
of sources including our own employees or unknown third parties. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store 
sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of our employees and our clients. Data protection and privacy rules 
have become a focus for regulators globally. For instance, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) 
amended data protection rules for individuals that are residents of the EU. GDPR imposes more stringent rules and greater 
penalties for non-compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Although we take various measures to ensure the integrity of our systems and to safeguard against failures or security breaches, 
there can be no assurance that these measures will provide adequate protection, and a compromise in these systems could go 
undetected for a significant period of time. If these information and technology systems are compromised, we could suffer a 
disruption in one or more of our businesses and experience, among other things, financial loss; a loss of business opportunities; 
misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential or personal information; damage to our systems and those with whom 
we do business; violations of privacy and other laws, litigation, regulatory penalties or remediation and restoration costs 
(particularly in light of increased regulatory focus on cyber-security by regulators around the world); as well as increased 
costs to maintain our systems. This could have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows and result in 
reputational damage.
r)  Dependence on Information Technology Systems
The failure of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our 
reputation and financial performance.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    108 
We operate in businesses that are dependent on information systems and technology, and we rely on third-party service 
providers to manage certain aspects of our businesses, including for certain information systems and technology, data 
processing systems, and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information. In particular, our financial, accounting 
and  communications  processes  are  all  conducted  through  data  processing  systems.  Our  information  technology  and 
communications systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damages or disruption from fire, 
power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or 
malfeasance, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other events which are beyond our control. 
Our information systems and technology and those of our third-party vendors may not continue to be able to accommodate our 
growth and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level, either of which could have a material 
adverse effect on us.
Any interruption or deterioration in the performance or failures of the information systems and technology that are necessary 
for our businesses, including for business continuity purposes, could impair the quality of our operations and could adversely 
affect our business, financial condition and reputation.
s)  Litigation
We and our affiliates may become involved in legal disputes in Canada, the U.S. and internationally that could adversely 
impact our financial performance and reputation.
In the normal course of our operations, we become involved in various legal actions, including claims relating to personal 
injury, property damage, property taxes, land rights and contract and other commercial disputes. The investment decisions we 
make in our asset management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of the portfolio companies 
of our managed entities may subject us, our managed entities and our portfolio companies to the risk of third-party litigation. 
Further, we have significant operations in the U.S. which may, as a result of the prevalence of litigation in the U.S., be more 
susceptible to legal action than certain of our other operations.
Management of our litigation matters is generally handled by legal counsel in the business unit most directly impacted by the 
litigation, and not by a centralized legal department. As a result, the management of litigation that we face may not always be 
appropriate or effective.
The final outcome with respect to outstanding, pending or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution 
of such actions may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations in a particular quarter or fiscal 
year. Any litigation may consume substantial amounts of our management’s time and attention, and that time and the devotion 
of these resources to litigation may, at times, be disproportionate to the amounts at stake in the litigation. Even if ultimately 
unsuccessful against us, any litigation has the potential to adversely affect our business, including by damaging our reputation.
t)  Insurance
Losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could adversely impact our financial performance.
We carry various insurance policies on our assets. These policies contain policy specifications, limits and deductibles that may 
mean that such policies do not provide coverage or sufficient coverage against all potential material losses. We may also self-
insure a portion of certain of these risks, and therefore the company may not be able to recover from a third-party insurer in the 
event that the company, if it had asset insurance coverage from a third party, could make a claim for recovery. There are certain 
types of risk (generally of a catastrophic nature such as war or environmental contamination) that are either uninsurable or not 
economically insurable. Further, there are certain types of risk for which insurance coverage is not equal to the full replacement 
cost of the insured assets. Should any uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated 
profits and cash flows from, one or more of our assets or operations.
We also carry directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (D&O insurance) for losses or advancement of defense costs in the 
event a legal action is brought against the company’s directors, officers or employees for alleged wrongful acts in their capacity 
as directors, officers or employees. Our D&O insurance contains certain customary exclusions that may make it unavailable for 
the company in the event it is needed; and in any case our D&O insurance may not be adequate to fully protect the company 
against liability for the conduct of its directors, officers or employees. We may also self-insure a portion of our D&O insurance, 
and therefore the company may not be able to recover from a third-party insurer in the event that the company, if it had D&O 
insurance from a third-party insurer, could make a claim for recovery.
For economic efficiency and other reasons, the Corporation and its affiliates may enter into insurance policies as a group which 
are intended to provide coverage for the entire group. Where group policies are in place, any payments under such policy could 
have a negative impact on other entities covered under the policy as they may not be able to access adequate insurance in the 
event it is needed. While management attempts to design coverage limits under group policies to ensure that all entities covered 
109    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
under a policy have access to sufficient insurance coverage, there are no guarantees that these efforts will be effective in 
obtaining this result.
u)  Credit and Counterparty Risk
Inability to collect amounts owing to us could adversely impact financial performance.
Third parties may not fulfill their payment obligations to us, which could include money, securities or other assets, thereby 
impacting our operations and financial results. These parties include deal and trading counterparties, governmental agencies, 
portfolio company customers and financial intermediaries. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to 
bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, general economic conditions or other reasons.
We have business lines whose models are to earn investment returns by loaning money to distressed companies, either privately 
or via an investment in publicly traded debt securities. As a result, we actively take heightened credit risk in other entities from 
time to time and whether we realize satisfactory investment returns on these loans is uncertain and may be beyond our control. 
If some of these debt investments fail, our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
Investors in our private funds make capital commitments to these vehicles through the execution of subscription agreements. 
When a private fund makes an investment, these capital commitments are then satisfied by our investors via capital 
contributions. Investors in our private funds may default on their capital commitment obligations, which could have an adverse 
impact on our earnings or result in other negative implications to our businesses such as the requirement to redeploy our own 
capital to cover such obligations. This impact would be magnified if the investor that does so is in multiple funds.
v)  Information Barriers
Information barriers may give rise to certain conflicts and risks and investment teams managing the activities of businesses 
that operate on opposite sides of an information barrier will not be aware of, and will not have the ability to manage, such 
conflicts and risks.
Certain businesses within our asset management operations operate largely independently of one another pursuant to an 
information barrier. The information barrier restricts businesses on opposite sides from coordinating or consulting with one 
another  with  respect  to  investment  activities  and/or  decisions.  Accordingly,  these  businesses  manage  their  investment 
operations independently of each other. The investment activities and decisions made by a business on one side of an 
information barrier are not expected to be subject to any internal approvals by any person who would have knowledge and/or 
decision-making control of the investment activities and decisions made by a business on the other side of the information 
barrier. This absence of coordination and consultation will give rise to certain conflicts and risks in connection with the 
activities of the businesses within our asset management operations and their portfolio companies, and make it more difficult to 
mitigate, ameliorate or avoid such situations. These conflicts (and potential conflicts) of interests may include: (i) competing 
from time to time for the same investment opportunities, (ii) the pursuit by a business on one side of the information barrier of 
investment opportunities suitable for a business on the other side of the information barrier, without making such opportunities 
available to such business, and (iii) the formation or establishment of new strategies or products that could compete or 
otherwise conduct their affairs without regard as to whether or not they adversely impact the strategies or products of our 
businesses operating on the other side of the information barrier. Investment teams managing the activities of businesses that 
operate on opposite sides of an information barrier are not expected to be aware of, and will not have the need or ability to 
manage, such conflicts which may impact the investment strategy, performance, and investment returns of certain businesses 
within our asset management operations and their portfolio companies. 
The asset management businesses that operate on opposite sides of an information barrier are likely to be deemed affiliates for 
purposes of certain laws and regulations notwithstanding that such businesses may be operationally independent from one 
another. The information barrier does not eliminate the requirement that such businesses aggregate certain investment holdings 
for certain securities laws and other regulatory purposes. This may result in, among other things, earlier public disclosure of 
investments; restrictions on transactions (including the ability to make or dispose of certain investments at certain times); 
potential short-swing profit disgorgement; penalties and/or regulatory remedies; or adverse effects on the prices of investments 
for our asset management businesses that operate on the other side of such information barrier. 
Although these information barriers were implemented to address the potential conflicts of interests and regulatory, legal and 
contractual requirements applicable to our asset management business, we may decide, at any time and without notice to our 
company or our shareholders, to remove or modify the information barriers within our asset management business. In addition, 
there may be breaches (including inadvertent breaches) of the information barriers and related internal controls. In the event 
that the information barrier is removed or modified, it would be expected that we will adopt certain protocols designed to 
address potential conflicts and other considerations relating to the management of the investment activities of those businesses 
that previously operated on opposite sides of an information barrier. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    110 
The breach or failure of our information barriers could result in the sharing of material non-public information between asset 
management businesses that operate on opposite sides of an information barrier, which may restrict the acquisition or 
disposition activities of one of our businesses and ultimately impact the returns generated for our investors. In addition, any 
such breach or failure could also result in potential regulatory investigations and claims for securities laws violations in 
connection with our direct and/or indirect investment activities. Any inadvertent trading on material non-public information, or 
perception of trading on material non-public information by one of our businesses or our personnel, could have a significant 
adverse effect on our reputation, result in the imposition of regulatory or financial sanctions, and negatively impact our ability 
to raise third-party capital and provide investment management services to our clients, all of which could result in negative 
financial impact to our investment activities. 
w)  Real Estate
We face risks specific to our real estate activities.
We invest in commercial properties and are therefore exposed to certain risks inherent in the commercial real estate business. 
Commercial real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk depending on the nature of the property. These risks 
include changes in general economic conditions (such as the availability and cost of mortgage capital), local conditions (such as 
an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which we operate), the attractiveness of the 
properties to tenants, competition from other landlords and our ability to provide adequate maintenance at an economical cost.
Certain expenditures, including property taxes, maintenance costs, mortgage payments, insurance costs and related charges, 
must be made whether or not a property is producing sufficient income to service these expenses. Our commercial properties 
are typically subject to mortgages which require debt service payments. If we become unable or unwilling to meet mortgage 
payments on any property, losses could be sustained as a result of the mortgagee’s exercise of its rights of foreclosure or of 
sale.
Continuation of rental income is dependent on favorable leasing markets to ensure expiring leases are renewed and new tenants 
are found promptly to fill vacancies. It is possible that we may face a disproportionate amount of space expiring in any one 
year. Additionally, rental rates could decline, tenant bankruptcies could increase and tenant renewals may not be achieved, 
particularly in the event of an economic slowdown.
Our real estate business operates in industries or geographies impacted by COVID-19. Many of these are facing financial and 
operational hardships due to COVID-19 and responses to it. Adverse impacts on our business may include:
• a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government or 
tenant action;
• a slowdown in business activity may severely impact our tenants' businesses, financial condition and liquidity and may 
cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to fund their business operations, meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, 
or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations;
• an increase in re-leasing timelines, potential delays in lease-up of vacant space and the market rates at which such lease 
will be executed;
• reduced economic activity could result in a prolonged recession, which could negatively impact consumer discretionary 
spending; and
• expected completion dates for our development and redevelopment projects may be subject to delay as a result of local 
economic conditions that may continue to be disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our retail real estate operations are susceptible to any economic factors that have a negative impact on consumer spending. 
Lower consumer spending would have an unfavorable effect on the sales of our retail tenants, which could result in their 
inability or unwillingness to make all payments owing to us, and on our ability to keep existing tenants and attract new tenants. 
Significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate assets, such as mortgage payments, property taxes 
and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when there is a reduction in income from the investment, so our income and 
cash flow would be adversely affected by a decline in income from our retail properties. In addition, low occupancy or sales at 
our retail properties, as a result of competition or otherwise, could result in termination of or reduced rent payable under certain 
of our retail leases, which could adversely affect our retail property revenues.
Our hospitality and multifamily businesses are subject to a range of operating risks common to these industries. The 
profitability of our investments in these industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside 
our control. For example, our hospitality business faces risks relating to climate change; hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and 
other natural and man-made disasters; the potential spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19; and insect infestations 
more common to rental accommodations. Such factors could limit or reduce the demand for or the prices our hospitality 
111    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
properties are able to obtain for their accommodations or could increase our costs and therefore reduce the profitability of our 
hospitality businesses. There are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our multifamily properties, including other 
multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single-family homes. This competitive environment could have a material 
adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired real estate, 
as well as on the rents realized.
x)  Renewable Power
We face risks specific to our renewable power activities.
Our renewable power operations are subject to changes in the weather, hydrology and price, but also include risks related to 
equipment or dam failure, counterparty performance, water rental costs, land rental costs, changes in regulatory requirements 
and other material disruptions.
The revenues generated by our power facilities are correlated to the amount of electricity generated, which in turn is dependent 
upon available water flows, wind, irradiance and other elements beyond our control. Hydrology, wind and irradiance levels 
vary naturally from year to year and may also change permanently because of climate change or other factors. It is therefore 
possible that low water, wind and irradiance levels at certain of our power generating operations could occur at any time and 
potentially continue for indefinite periods.
A portion of our renewable power revenue is tied, either directly or indirectly, to the wholesale market price for electricity, 
which is impacted by a number of external factors beyond our control. Additionally, a portion of the power we generate is sold 
under long-term power purchase agreements, shorter-term financial instruments and physical electricity contracts which are 
intended to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in wholesale electricity prices; however, they may not be effective in achieving 
this outcome. Certain of our power purchase agreements will be subject to re-contracting in the future. If the price of electricity 
in power markets is declining at the time of such re-contracting, it may impact our ability to re-negotiate or replace these 
contracts on terms that are acceptable to us. 
In our renewable power operations there is a risk of equipment failure due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or 
operator error, among other things. The occurrence of such failures could result in a loss of generating capacity and repairing 
such failures could require the expenditure of significant capital and other resources. Failures could also result in exposure to 
significant liability for damages due to harm to the environment, to the public generally or to specific third parties.
In certain cases, some catastrophic events may not excuse us from performing our obligations pursuant to agreements with third 
parties and we may be liable for damages or suffer further losses as a result.
Our ability to develop greenfield renewable power projects in our development pipeline may be affected by a number of 
factors, including the ability to secure approvals, licenses and permits and the ability to secure a long-term power purchase 
agreement or other sales contracts on reasonable terms. The development of our pipeline of greenfield renewable power 
projects is also subject to environmental, engineering and construction risks that could result in cost-overruns, delays and 
reduced performance. 
y)  Infrastructure
We face risks specific to our infrastructure activities.
Our  infrastructure  operations  include  utilities,  transport,  midstream,  data,  timberlands  and  agriculture  operations.  Our 
infrastructure assets include toll roads, telecommunication towers, electricity transmission systems, terminal operations, 
electricity and gas distribution companies, rail networks, ports and data centers. The principal risks facing the regulated and 
unregulated businesses comprising our infrastructure operations relate to government regulation, general economic conditions 
and other material disruptions, counterparty performance, capital expenditure requirements and land use.
Many of our infrastructure operations are subject to forms of economic regulation, including with respect to revenues. If any of 
the respective regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate decide to change the tolls or rates we are allowed to charge, or 
the amounts of the provisions we are allowed to collect, we may not be able to earn the rate of return on our investments that 
we had planned, or we may not be able to recover our initial cost.
General  economic  conditions  affect  international  demand  for  the  commodities  handled  and  services  provided  by  our 
infrastructure operations and the goods produced and sold by our timberlands and agriculture businesses. A downturn in the 
economy generally, including as a result of the current pandemic resulting from COVID-19, or specific to any of our 
infrastructure businesses, may lead to a reduction in volumes, bankruptcies or liquidations of one or more large customers, 
which could reduce our revenues, increase our bad debt expense, reduce our ability to make capital expenditures or have other 
adverse effects on us.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    112 
Some of our infrastructure operations have customer contracts as well as concession agreements in place with public and 
private sector clients. Our operations with customer contracts could be adversely affected by any material change in the assets, 
financial condition or results of operations of such customers. Protecting the quality of our revenue streams through the 
inclusion of take-or-pay or guaranteed minimum volume provisions into our contracts, is not always possible or fully effective.
Our infrastructure operations may require substantial capital expenditures to maintain our asset base. Any failure to make 
necessary expenditures to maintain our operations could impair our ability to serve existing customers or accommodate 
increased volumes. In addition, we may not be able to recover investments in capital expenditures based upon the rates our 
operations are able to charge.
z)  Private Equity
We face risks specific to our private equity activities.
The principal risks for our private equity businesses are potential loss of invested capital as well as insufficient investment or 
fee income to cover operating expenses and cost of capital. Our private equity platform is exposed to industrial, business 
services and infrastructure services businesses, many of which can be cyclical and/or illiquid and therefore may be difficult to 
monetize at our discretion, limiting our flexibility to react to changing economic or investment conditions. In addition, 
increasingly we have certain private equity businesses that provide goods and services directly to consumers across a variety of 
industries. These businesses are prone to greater liabilities, as well as reputational, litigation and other risks by virtue of being 
more public-facing and reliant on their ability to develop and preserve consumer relationships and achieve consumer 
satisfaction.
Unfavorable economic conditions, including those driven by the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively 
impact the ability of investee companies to repay debt. Even with our support, such adverse economic conditions facing our 
investee companies may adversely impact the value of our investments or deplete our financial or management resources. 
These investments are also subject to the risks inherent in the underlying businesses, some of which are facing difficult 
business conditions and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These risks are compounded by recent growth, as new 
acquisitions have increased the scale and scope of our operations, including in new geographic areas and industry sectors, and 
we may have difficulty managing these additional operations. 
We may invest in companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved 
in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions. Such an investment entails the risk 
that the transaction will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or new securities, the 
value of which may be less than the purchase price of the securities in respect of which such distribution is received. In 
addition, if an anticipated transaction does not occur, we may be required to sell our investment at a loss. Investments 
in businesses we target may become subject to legal and/or regulatory proceedings and our investment may be adversely 
affected by external events beyond our control, leading to legal, indemnification or other expenses.
We  have  several  companies  that  operate  in  the  highly  competitive  service  industry.  A  wide  variety  of  micro  and 
macroeconomic factors affecting our clients and over which we have no control can impact how these companies operate. For 
example, our Canadian residential mortgage insurance services business is subject to significant regulation and may be 
adversely affected by changes in government policy. In addition, the majority of the revenue from our Australian health 
services business is derived from private health insurance funds, which may be affected by a deterioration in the economic 
climate, a change in economic incentives, increases in private health insurance premiums, any sudden changes in Australia’s 
disease burden (including as a result of the impact of COVID-19) and other factors. In addition, alternative technologies in the 
health care industry could impact the demand for, or use of, our services and could impair or eliminate the competitive 
advantage of our businesses in this industry.
Our infrastructure services operations include companies in nuclear servicing, marine transportation and scaffolding services. 
The nuclear power generation industry is politically sensitive and opposition to particular projects could lead to increased 
regulation and/or more onerous operating requirements that negatively impact our nuclear servicing business. A future accident 
at a nuclear reactor could result in the shutdown of existing plants or impact the continued acceptance by the public and 
regulatory authorities of nuclear energy and the future prospects for nuclear generators. Accidents, terrorism, natural disasters 
or other incidents occurring at nuclear facilities or involving shipments of nuclear materials could reduce the demand for 
nuclear services. Marine transportation and oil production is inherently risky, particularly in the extreme conditions in which 
many of our vessels operate. An incident involving significant loss of product or environmental contamination by any of our 
vessels could harm our reputation and business. Our scaffolding services business is subject to the risks inherent to construction 
operations, including risks relating to seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our services, a dependence on labor and 
performance being materially impacted by a lack of availability of labor force or increases in the cost of labor available, 
and operational hazards that could result in personal injury or death, work stoppage or serious property and equipment damage. 
113    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
We have industrial operations that are substantially dependent upon the prices we receive for the resources we produce. Those 
prices depend on factors beyond our control, and commodity price declines can have a significant negative impact on these 
operations. Sustained depressed levels, declines or high volatility of the price of resources such as lead, oil, gas and limestone, 
as well as changes in the industries upon which our industrial operations are dependent, including the automotive, water, 
wastewater and oil and gas industries, may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Our industrial operations were 
significantly impacted by a reduction in global demand driven by COVID-19 and could be further impacted by any economic 
volatility associated with government-mandated restrictions related to COVID-19. For these types of businesses, it can be 
difficult or expensive to obtain insurance. Our industrial operations can face labor disruptions and economically unfavorable 
collective bargaining agreements, as well as exposure to occupational health and safety and accident risks.
Unforeseen political events in markets where we own and operate assets and may look to for further growth, such as Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Europe, India and the U.S., may create economic uncertainty. Such uncertainty could cause disruptions to our 
businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and suppliers, as well as altering the 
relationship among tariffs and currencies. In addition, political outcomes in the markets in which we operate may also result in 
legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, which can contribute to general economic uncertainty. 
Economic uncertainty impacting us and our managed entities could be exacerbated by near-term political events, including 
those in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, India, the U.S and elsewhere.
aa) Residential Development
We face risks specific to our residential development and mixed-use activities.
Our residential homebuilding and land development operations are cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and 
local economic and industry conditions, such as consumer confidence, employment levels, availability of financing for 
homebuyers, household debt, levels of new and existing homes for sale, demographic trends and housing demand. Competition 
from rental properties and resale homes, including homes held for sale by investors and foreclosed homes, may reduce our 
ability to sell new homes, depress prices and reduce margins for the sale of new homes.
Virtually all of our homebuilding customers finance their home acquisitions through mortgages. Even if potential customers do 
not need financing, changes in interest rates or the unavailability of mortgage capital could make it harder for them to sell their 
homes to potential buyers who need financing, resulting in a reduced demand for new homes. Rising mortgage rates or reduced 
mortgage availability could adversely affect our ability to sell new homes and the prices at which we can sell them.  
Notwithstanding low interest rates, our Canadian markets continue to be impacted by changes to mortgage qualification rules 
that introduced stress tests for homebuyers and government policies relating to the Ontario real estate market and the Alberta 
energy sector surrounding pipeline approval. In the U.S., significant expenses incurred for purposes of owning a home, 
including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s U.S. federal 
and, in some cases, state income taxes. However, in 2017 mortgage interest deductibility was reduced significantly for both 
federal and state taxes, which may adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes. These changes are in effect for 
taxable years 2018 through 2025.
COVID-19 and the current economic environment also continues to impact the industry for retail and office properties in our 
mixed-use projects. As we depend on office, retail, and apartment tenants to generate income from these mixed-use projects, 
our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by vacancies and tenant defaults or bankruptcy in our 
mixed-use properties, and we may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space in our mixed-use properties as leases expire.
We hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings. The risks inherent in purchasing, 
owning and developing land increase as the demand for new homes decreases. Real estate markets are highly uncertain, and the 
value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate. In addition, land carrying costs can be 
significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability. As a result, we hold certain land, and may acquire additional land, 
in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which precludes profitable development.
Our residential development and mixed-use business is susceptible to adverse weather conditions, other environmental 
conditions, and natural disasters, as well as pandemics/epidemics such as COVID-19, each of which could adversely affect our 
business and results of operations. For example, while none of our U.S. properties were materially adversely affected by the 
recent significant wildfires throughout Southern California, we could experience labor shortages, construction delays, or utility 
company delays, which in turn could impact our results.

Performance Measures
Definitions of performance measures, including IFRS, non-IFRS and operating measures, are presented below in alphabetical 
order.  We  have  specifically  identified  those  measures  which  are  IFRS  or  non-IFRS  measures;  the  remainder  are 
operating measures.
Assets under management (“AUM”) refers to the total fair value of assets that we manage, on a gross asset value basis, 
including assets for which we earn management fees and those for which we do not. AUM is calculated as follows: (i) for 
investments that Brookfield consolidates for accounting purposes or actively manages, including investments of which 
Brookfield or a controlled investment vehicle is the largest shareholder or the primary operator or manager, at 100% of the 
investment’s total assets on a fair value basis; and (ii) for all other investments, at Brookfield’s or its controlled investment 
vehicle’s, as applicable, proportionate share of the investment’s total assets on a fair value basis. Brookfield’s methodology for 
determining AUM may differ from the methodology employed by other alternative asset managers and Brookfield’s AUM 
presented herein may differ from our AUM reflected in other public filings and/or our Form ADV and Form PF.
115    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Base management fees, which are determined by contractual arrangements, are typically equal to a percentage of fee-bearing 
capital and are accrued quarterly. Base management fees, including private fund base fees and listed affiliate base fees, 
are IFRS measures.
Private fund base fees are typically earned on fee-bearing capital from third-party investors only and are earned on invested 
and/or uninvested fund capital, depending on the stage of the fund life.
Listed affiliate base fees are earned on the total capitalization, including debt and market capitalization, of the listed affiliates, 
which  includes  our  investment.  Base  fees  for  BPY  and  BEP  include  a  quarterly  fixed  fee  amount  of  $12.5  million 
and $5 million, respectively. BPY and BEP each pay additional fees of 1.25% on the increase in market capitalization above 
their initial capitalization of $11.5 billion and $8 billion, respectively. Base fees for BPYU, BIP and BBU are 1.25% of 
total capitalization. BPYU capital was subject to a 12-month fee waiver which expired at the end of August 2019.
Carried interest is an IFRS measure that is a contractual arrangement whereby we receive a fixed percentage of investment 
gains generated within a private fund provided that the investors receive a pre-determined minimum return. Carried interest is 
typically paid towards the end of the life of a fund after the capital has been returned to investors and may be subject to 
clawback until all investments have been monetized and minimum investment returns are sufficiently assured.
Realized carried interest is an IFRS measure and represents our share of investment returns based on realized gains within a 
private fund. Realized carried interest earned is recognized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the 
fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of preferred returns, in accordance with the respective terms set out in the fund’s 
governing agreements, and when the probability of clawback is remote. We include realized carried interest when determining 
our Asset Management segment results within our consolidated financial statements.
Realized carried interest, net is a non-IFRS measure and represents realized carried interest after direct costs, which include 
employee expenses and cash taxes. A reconciliation of realized carried interest to realized carried interest, net, is shown below:
AS AT DEC. 31                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2020 2019

1. Includes $339 million of realized carried interest related to Oaktree (2019 – $35 million). For segment reporting, Oaktree’s revenue is shown on a 100% basis.
Carry eligible capital represents the capital committed, pledged or invested in the private funds that we manage and which 
entitle us to earn carried interest. Carry eligible capital includes both invested and uninvested (i.e., uncalled) private fund 
amounts as well as those amounts invested directly by investors (co-investments) if those entitle us to earn carried interest. We 
believe this measure is useful to investors as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which we have potential to 
earn carried interest once minimum investment returns are sufficiently assured.
Adjusted carry eligible capital excludes uncalled fund commitments and funds that have not yet reached their preferred 
return, as well as co-investments and separately managed accounts that are subject to lower carried interest than our 
standard funds.
A reconciliation from carry eligible capital to adjusted carry eligible capital is provided below:

Cash available for distribution and/or reinvestment is a non-IFRS measure that provides insight into earnings received by 
the Corporation that are available for distribution to common shareholders or to be reinvested into the business. It is calculated 
as the sum of our Asset Management segment FFO (i.e., fee-related earnings and realized carried interest, net); distributions 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    116 
from our listed affiliates, other investments that pay regular cash distributions and FFO from our corporate cash and financial 
assets; other invested capital earnings, which include FFO from our residential operations, energy contracts, sustainable 
resources and other real estate, private equity, corporate investments that do not pay regular cash distributions, corporate costs 
and corporate interest expense; excluding equity-based compensation costs and net of preferred share dividend payments.

1. Excludes $186 million and $104 million of fee-related earnings and realized carried interest, net from Oaktree, respectively (2019 – $32 million and $10 million). See 
definition in Glossary of Terms beginning on page 115.
Consolidated capitalization reflects the full capitalization of wholly owned and partially-owned entities that we consolidate in 
our financial statements. Our consolidated capitalization includes 100% of the debt of the consolidated entities even though 
in many cases we only own a portion of the entity and therefore our pro-rata exposure to this debt is much lower. In other 
cases, this basis of presentation excludes the debt of partially-owned entities that are accounted for following the equity 
method, such as our investments in Canary Wharf and several of our infrastructure businesses.
Core liquidity represents the amount of cash, financial assets and undrawn credit lines at the Corporation, listed affiliates and 
directly held investments. We use core liquidity as a key measure of our ability to fund future transactions and capitalize 
quickly on opportunities as they arise. Our core liquidity also allows us to backstop the transactions of our various businesses 
as necessary and fund the development of new activities that are not yet suitable for our investors.
Total liquidity represents the sum of core liquidity and uncalled private fund commitments and is used to pursue new 
transactions.
Corporate capitalization represents the amount of debt issued by the Corporation, accounts payable and deferred tax liability 
in our Corporate segment as well as our issued and outstanding common and preferred shares.
Distributions (current rate) represents the distributions that we would receive during the next twelve months based on the 
current distribution rates of the investments that we currently hold. The dividends from our listed investments are calculated by  
multiplying  the  number  of  shares  held  by  the  most  recently  announced  distribution  policy.  The  yield  on  cash  and 
financial assets portfolio is equal to 8% of the weighted-average balance of the last four quarters of our corporate cash 
and financial assets. Distributions on our unlisted investments are calculated based on the quarterly distributions received in 
the most recent fiscal year.
Economic ownership interest represents the company’s proportionate equity interest in our listed affiliates which can include 
redemption-exchange  units  (“REUs”),  Class  A  limited  partnership  units,  special  limited  partnership  units  and  general 
partnership units in each subsidiary, where applicable, as well as any units or shares issued in subsidiaries that are 
exchangeable for units in our listed affiliates (“exchange units”). REUs and exchange units share the same economic attributes 
as the Class A limited partnership units in all respects except for our redemption right, which the listed affiliate can satisfy 
through the issuance of Class A limited partnership units. The REUs, general partnership units and exchange units participate in 
earnings and distributions on a per unit basis equivalent to the per unit participation of the Class A limited partnership units of 
the subsidiary.
Fee-bearing capital represents the capital committed, pledged or invested in the listed affiliates, private funds and public 
securities that we manage which entitles us to earn fee revenues. Fee-bearing capital includes both called (“invested”) and 
uncalled (“pledged” or “committed”) amounts. When reconciling period amounts, we utilize the following definitions:
• Inflows include capital commitments and contributions to our private and public securities funds and equity issuances in 
our listed affiliates.
117    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
• Outflows represent distributions and redemptions of capital from within the public securities capital.
• Distributions represent quarterly distributions from listed affiliates as well as returns of committed capital (excluding 
market valuation adjustments), redemptions and expiry of uncalled commitments within our private funds.
• Market valuation includes gains (losses) on portfolio investments, listed affiliates and public securities based on 
market prices.
• Other includes changes in net non-recourse leverage included in the determination of listed affiliate capitalization and the 
impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar commitments.
Fee-related earnings is an IFRS measure that is comprised of fee revenues less direct costs associated with earning those fees, 
which include employee expenses and professional fees as well as business related technology costs, other shared services and 
taxes. We use this measure to provide additional insight into the operating profitability of our asset management activities.
Fee revenues is an IFRS measure and includes base management fees, incentive distributions, performance fees and 
transaction fees presented within our Asset Management segment. Many of these items do not appear in consolidated revenues 
because they are earned from consolidated entities and are eliminated on consolidation.
Funds from operations (“FFO”) is a key measure of our financial performance. We use FFO to assess operating results and 
the performance of our businesses on a segmented basis. While we use segment FFO as our segment measure of profit and loss 
(see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements), the sum of FFO for all our segments, or total FFO, is a non-IFRS 
measure. The following table reconciles total FFO to net income:
  Total Per Share

1. Adjustment to back out non-FFO expenses (income) that are included in consolidated equity accounted income including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes 
and fair value changes from equity accounted investments.
We use FFO to assess our performance as an asset manager and separately as an investor in our assets. FFO includes the fees 
that we earn from managing capital as well as our share of revenues earned and costs incurred within our operations, which 
include interest expense and other costs. Specifically, FFO includes the impact of contracts that we enter into to generate 
revenue, including asset management agreements, power sales agreements, contracts that our operating businesses enter into 
such as leases and take or pay contracts and sales of inventory. FFO also includes the impact of changes in borrowings or the 
cost of borrowings as well as other costs incurred to operate our business.
We use realized disposition gains and losses within FFO in order to provide additional insight regarding the performance 
of investments on a cumulative realized basis, including any unrealized fair value adjustments that were recorded in equity and 
not otherwise reflected in current period FFO, and believe it is useful to investors to better understand variances between 
reporting periods. We exclude depreciation and amortization from FFO as we believe that the value of most of our assets 
typically increases over time, provided we make the necessary maintenance expenditures, the timing and magnitude of which 
may differ from the amount of depreciation recorded in any given period. In addition, the depreciated cost base of our assets is 
reflected in the ultimate realized disposition gain or loss on disposal. As noted above, unrealized fair value changes 
are excluded from FFO until the period in which the asset is sold. We also exclude deferred income taxes from FFO 
because the vast majority of the company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are a result of the revaluation of our assets 
under IFRS.
Our definition of FFO may differ from the definition used by other organizations, as well as the definition of FFO used by the 
Real Property Association of Canada (“REALPAC”) and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. 
(“NAREIT”), in part because the NAREIT definition is based on U.S. GAAP, as opposed to IFRS. The key differences 
between our definition of FFO and the determination of FFO by REALPAC and/or NAREIT are that we include the following: 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    118 
realized disposition gains or losses and cash taxes payable or receivable on those gains or losses, if any; foreign exchange gains 
or losses on monetary items not forming part of our net investment in foreign operations; and foreign exchange gains or losses 
on the sale of an investment in a foreign operation. We do not use FFO as a measure of cash generated from our operations.
Incentive distributions is an IFRS measure that is determined by contractual arrangements; incentive distributions are paid to 
us by BPY, BEP and BIP and represent a portion of distributions paid by listed affiliates above a predetermined hurdle. 
Incentive distributions are accrued on the record date of the associated distributions of the entity.
A summary of our distribution hurdles and current distribution rates is as follows:
Current Distribution Hurdles Incentive
Distribution Rate1 (per unit)2 Distributions
AS AT DEC. 31, 2020
Brookfield Infrastructure (BIP)3........................................................ $  2.04  $  0.73 / $  0.79  15% / 25%
Brookfield Renewable (BEP)4..........................................................   1.22    0.80 /   0.90  15% / 25%
Brookfield Property (BPY)5..............................................................   1.33    1.10 /   1.20  15% / 25%
1. Current rate based on most recently announced distribution rates.
2. Incentive distributions equate to 18% and 33% of limited partner distribution increases over the first and second hurdles, respectively.
3. Incentive distributions from Brookfield Infrastructure are earned on distributions made by BIP and BIPC. 
4. Incentive distributions from Brookfield Renewable are earned on distributions made by BEP and BEPC. 
5. Incentive distributions from Brookfield Property are earned on distributions made by BPY and BPYU.
Invested capital consists of investments in our listed affiliates, other listed securities, unlisted investments and corporate 
working capital. Our invested capital provides us with FFO and cash distributions.
Invested capital, net consists of invested capital and leverage.
Leverage represents the amount of corporate borrowings and perpetual preferred shares held by the company.
Long-term average (“LTA”) generation is used in our Renewable Power segment and is determined based on expected 
electrical generation from its assets in commercial operation during the year. For assets acquired or reaching commercial 
operation during the year, LTA generation is calculated from the acquisition or commercial operation date. In Brazil, assured 
generation levels are used as a proxy for LTA. We compare LTA generation to actual generation levels to assess the impact on 
revenues and FFO of hydrology, wind generation levels and irradiance, which vary from one period to the next.
Performance fees is an IFRS measure. Performance fees are paid to us when we exceed predetermined investment returns 
within BBU and on certain public securities portfolios. BBU performance fees are accrued quarterly based on the volume-
weighted average increase in BBU unit price over the previous threshold, whereas performance fees within public securities 
funds are typically determined on an annual basis. Performance fees are not subject to clawback.
Proportionate basis generation is used in our Renewable Power segment to describe the total amount of power generated by 
facilities held by BEP, at BEP’s respective economic ownership interest percentage.
Realized disposition gains/losses is a component of FFO and includes gains or losses arising from transactions during the 
reporting period together with any fair value changes and revaluation surplus recorded in prior periods, presented net of cash 
taxes payable or receivable. Realized disposition gains include amounts that are recorded in net income, other comprehensive 
income and as ownership changes in our consolidated statements of equity, and exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling 
interests  unless  otherwise  noted.  We  use  realized  disposition  gains/losses  to  provide  additional  insight  regarding  the 
performance of investments on a cumulative realized basis, including any unrealized fair value adjustments that were recorded 
in prior periods and not otherwise reflected in current period FFO, and believe it is useful to investors to better understand 
variances between reporting periods.
Same-store or same-property represents the earnings contribution from assets or investments held throughout both the current 
and prior reporting period on a constant ownership basis. We utilize same-store analysis to illustrate the growth in earnings 
excluding the impact of acquisitions or dispositions.
Unrealized carried interest is the change in accumulated unrealized carried interest from prior period and represents the 
amount of carried interest generated during the period. We use this measure to provide insight into the value our investments 
have created in the period.
Accumulated unrealized carried interest is based on carried interest that would be receivable under the contractual formula 
at the period end date as if a fund was liquidated and all investments had been monetized at the values recorded on that date. 
We use this measure to provide insight into our potential to realize carried interest in the future. Details of components of our 
accumulated unrealized carried interest are included in the definition of unrealized carried interest below.
119    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Accumulated unrealized carried interest, net is after direct costs, which include employee expenses and taxes.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
MANAGEMENT’S  REPORT  ON  INTERNAL  CONTROL  OVER  FINANCIAL 
REPORTING 
Management of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (Brookfield) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the 
supervision of, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, 
management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as defined in Regulation 240.13a-15(f) or 240.15d-15(f). 
Management assessed the effectiveness of Brookfield’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, 
based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of December 31, 2020, 
Brookfield’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management excluded from its assessment the internal 
control over financial reporting for Summit Digitel Infrastructure Private Limited, IndoStar Capital Finance Limited, several 
real estate entities and the 100 MW concentrated solar portfolio in Spain, which were acquired during 2020, and whose total 
assets, net assets, revenues and net income constitute approximately 3%, 3%, 1% and 1% respectively, of the consolidated 
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Brookfield’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Deloitte LLP, the 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, who also audited Brookfield’s consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended December 31, 2020. As stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Deloitte LLP expressed 
an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Brookfield’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and subsidiaries (the 
“Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control –  Integrated Framework (2013) issued 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Company and our 
report dated March 23, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
As  described  in  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting,  management  excluded  from  its 
assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Summit Digitel Infrastructure Private Limited, IndoStar Capital 
Finance Limited, several real estate entities and the 100 MW concentrated solar portfolio in Spain, which were acquired during 
2020 and whose financial statements constitute, in aggregate, 3% of total assets, 3% of net assets, 1% of revenues and 1% of 
net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our 
audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Summit Digitel Infrastructure Private Limited, IndoStar 
Capital Finance Limited, several real estate entities and the 100 MW concentrated solar portfolio in Spain. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s 
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk 
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the 
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and other financial information in this Annual Report have been prepared 
by the company’s management which is responsible for their integrity, consistency, objectivity and reliability. To fulfill this 
responsibility, the company maintains policies, procedures and systems of internal control to ensure that its reporting practices 
and accounting and administrative procedures are appropriate to provide a high degree of assurance that is relevant and reliable 
financial information is produced and assets are safeguarded. These controls include the careful selection and training of 
employees,  the  establishment  of  well-defined  areas  of  responsibility  and  accountability  for  performance,  and  the 
communication of policies and code of conduct throughout the company. In addition, the company maintains an internal audit 
group that conducts periodic audits of the company’s operations. The Chief Internal Auditor has full access to the Audit 
Committee. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and, where appropriate, reflect estimates based on management’s 
judgment. The financial information presented throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the information contained in 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

123    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and subsidiaries (the 
“Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, 
changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes 
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and its financial performance and its cash 
flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission and our report dated March 23, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due 
to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that 
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The 
communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and 
we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which it relates.  
Fair Value of Investment Properties and Property, Plant and Equipment – Refer to Notes 2(g)(i), 2(g)(ii), 11 and 
12 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has elected the fair value model for investment properties and the revaluation model for certain classes of 
property, plant and equipment, namely the Company’s renewable power generating, utilities, transport, communication, energy, 
and hospitality operating assets. The Company measures these assets at fair value or revalued amount subsequent to initial 
recognition on the balance sheet. 
The investment properties and certain classes of property, plant and equipment have limited observable market activity, which 
requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The estimates and 
assumptions with the highest degree of subjectivity and impact on fair values are future expected market rents and revenues, 
operating margins, terminal value multiples, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates. Auditing these estimates and 
assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment as the estimations made by management contains significant 
measurement uncertainty. This resulted in an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve fair value 
specialists.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    124 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to future expected market rents and revenues, operating margins, terminal value multiples, 
terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates of investment properties and certain classes of property, plant and equipment 
included the following, among others:
• Evaluated the effectiveness of controls, including those related to management’s process for determining investment 
properties and certain classes of property, plant and equipment fair values including those over determining future 
expected market rents and revenues, operating margins, terminal value multiples, terminal capitalization rates, and 
discount rates. 
• Tested management’s future expected market rents and revenues, operating margins, terminal value multiples, terminal 
capitalization rates, and discount rates through independent analysis and comparison to external sources including 
objective contractual information, and observable economic indicators, where applicable.
• Evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate fair value and future expected market rents and revenues and 
operating margins by comparing management’s historical fair value estimates to market transactions and forecasts to 
actual results. 
• Evaluated the impact of current market events and conditions, including relevant comparable transactions, on the 
assumptions used by management.
• With the assistance of fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s determination of terminal 
value multiples, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates by (1) testing the source information underlying the 
determination of terminal value multiples, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates; (2) developing a range of 
independent estimates and comparing those to the terminal value multiples, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates 
selected by management; and (3) considering recent market transactions and industry surveys.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.  ORGANIZATION AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Organization
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (the “Corporation”) is a global alternative asset management company. References in these 
financial statements to “Brookfield,” “us,” “we,” “our” or “the company” refer to the Corporation and its direct and indirect 
subsidiaries and consolidated entities. The company owns and operates assets with a focus on real estate, renewable power, 
infrastructure, private equity and credit. The Corporation is listed on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges under the 
symbols BAM and BAM.A, respectively. The Corporation was formed by articles of amalgamation under the Business 
Corporations Act (Ontario) and is registered in Ontario, Canada. The registered office of the Corporation is Brookfield Place, 
181 Bay Street, Suite 300, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2T3.
Capital Management
The company utilizes the Corporation’s Capital to manage the business in a number of ways, including operating performance, 
value creation, credit metrics and capital efficiency. The performance of the Corporation’s Capital is closely tracked and 
monitored by the company’s key management personnel and evaluated relative to management’s objectives. The primary goal 
of the company is to earn a 12-15% return compounded over the long-term while always maintaining excess capital to support 
ongoing operations.
The Corporation’s Capital consists of the capital invested in its asset management activities, including investments in entities 
that it manages, its corporate investments that are held outside of managed entities and its net working capital. The 
Corporation’s Capital is funded with common equity, preferred equity and corporate borrowings issued by the Corporation. 
As at December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s Capital totaled $45.1 billion (2019 – $42.1 billion), and is computed as follows:

Corporate borrowings..............................................................................................................................   9,077    7,083 
$  45,145  $  42,096 
The Corporation generates returns on its capital through management fees and performance revenues earned as an asset 
manager, as well as distributions or dividends earned from its capital invested in managed entities, and through performance of 
the Corporation’s financial asset investments. Prudent levels of corporate borrowings and preferred equity are utilized to 
enhance returns to shareholders’ common equity.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Statement of Compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
These consolidated financial statements were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors of the company on March 23, 
2021.
b)  Future Changes in Accounting Standards
i.  Insurance Contracts
In May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (“IFRS 17”), which establishes principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and will 
be applied retrospectively. In June 2020, the IASB proposed an amendment to IFRS 17 providing a one-year deferral on the 
effective date of the standard to January 1, 2023. IFRS 17 requires insurance contract liabilities to be measured at a 
current fulfillment value and provides a more uniform measurement and presentation approach for all insurance contracts. 
The company is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 17 on its operations.
133    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
ii.  Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
On August 27, 2020, the IASB published Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 
and IFRS 16 (“Phase II Amendments”), effective January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Phase II Amendments 
provide additional guidance to address issues that will arise during the transition of benchmark interest rates. The Phase II 
Amendments primarily relate to the modification of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities where the basis for 
determining the contractual cash flows changes as a result of IBOR reform, allowing for prospective application of the 
applicable benchmark interest rate and to the application of hedge accounting, providing an exception such that changes in 
the formal designation and documentation of hedge accounting relationships that are needed to reflect the changes required by 
IBOR reform do not result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting or the designation of new hedging relationships.
The company is progressing through its assessment and the transition plan to address the impact and effect changes as a result 
of amendments to the contractual terms of IBOR referenced floating-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, and 
updating hedge designations. The adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our company’s financial reporting.
c)  Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. 
i.  Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries, which are the entities over 
which the company exercises control. Control exists when the company is able to exercise power over the investee, is exposed 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the 
amount of its returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is obtained and continue to be consolidated until the 
date when control is lost. The company includes 100% of its subsidiaries’ revenues and expenses in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations and 100% of its subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with non-
controlling interests in the equity of the company’s subsidiaries included within the company’s equity. All intercompany 
balances, transactions, unrealized gains and losses are eliminated in full.
The company continually reassesses whether or not it controls an investee, particularly if facts and circumstances indicate there 
is a change to one or more of the control criteria previously mentioned. In certain circumstances when the company has less 
than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it 
the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The company considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether or not the company’s voting rights are sufficient to give it control of an investee. 
Certain of the company’s subsidiaries are subject to profit sharing arrangements, such as carried interest, between the company 
and the non-controlling equity holders, whereby the company is entitled to a participation in profits, as determined under the 
agreements. The attribution of net income amongst equity holders in these subsidiaries reflects the impact of these profit 
sharing arrangements when the attribution of profits as determined in the agreement is no longer subject to adjustment based on 
future events and correspondingly reduces non-controlling interests’ attributable share of those profits. 
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the company’s ownership interest of a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control 
are accounted for as equity transactions and are recorded within ownership changes as a component of equity. When we 
dispose of all or part of a subsidiary resulting in a loss of control, the difference between the carrying value of what is sold and 
the proceeds from disposition is recognized within other income and gains in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Refer to Note 2(q) for an explanation of the company’s accounting policy for business combinations and to Note 4 for 
additional information on subsidiaries of the company with significant non-controlling interests. 
ii.  Associates and Joint Ventures 
Associates are entities over which the company exercises significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but without control or joint control over those policies. Joint 
ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the net assets 
of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only 
when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The company accounts 
for  associates  and  joint  ventures  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting  within  equity  accounted  investments  on  the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Interests in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method are initially recognized at cost. At the time of 
initial recognition, if the cost of the associate or joint venture is lower than the proportionate share of the investment’s 
underlying fair value, the company records a gain on the difference between the cost and the underlying fair value of the 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    134 
investment in net income. If the cost of the associate or joint venture is greater than the company’s proportionate share of the 
underlying fair value, goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying value of the company’s interest in an associate or joint venture is adjusted for the 
company’s share of comprehensive income and distributions of the investee. Profit and losses resulting from transactions with 
an associate or joint venture are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the interests of unrelated investors 
in the investee. The carrying value of associates or joint ventures is assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet 
date. Impairment losses on equity accounted investments may be subsequently reversed in net income. Further information on 
the impairment of long-lived assets is available in Note 2(l).
iii.  Joint Operations 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, 
and obligations for the liabilities, related to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of 
an arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of parties sharing 
control. The company recognizes only its assets, liabilities and share of the results of operations of the joint operation. The 
assets, liabilities and results of joint operations are included within the respective line items of the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
d)  Foreign Currency Translation 
The U.S. dollar is the functional and presentation currency of the company. Each of the company’s subsidiaries, associates, 
joint ventures and joint operations determines its own functional currency and items included in the consolidated financial 
statements of each subsidiary, associate, joint venture and joint operation are measured using that functional currency. 
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date and revenues and expenses at average rates during the period. Gains or losses on 
translation are accumulated as a component of equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, or the loss of control, joint control 
or significant influence, the component of accumulated other comprehensive income relating to that foreign operation is 
reclassified to net income. Gains or losses on foreign currency denominated balances and transactions that are designated as 
hedges of net investments in these operations are reported in the same manner. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the company are translated using the rate of exchange 
prevailing at the reporting date and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Revenues and expenses are measured at average rates 
during the period. Gains or losses on translation of these items are included in net income. Gains or losses on transactions 
which hedge these items are also included in net income. Foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities, 
measured at historic cost, are translated at the rate of exchange at the transaction date. 
e)  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid short-term investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
f)  Related Party Transactions 
In the normal course of operations, the company enters into various transactions on market terms with related parties. The 
majority of transactions with related parties are between consolidated entities and eliminate on consolidation. The company and 
its subsidiaries may also transact with entities over which the company has significant influence or joint control. Amounts 
owed to and by associates and joint ventures are not eliminated on consolidation. The company’s subsidiaries with significant 
non-controlling interests are described in Note 4 and its associates and joint ventures are described in Note 10.
In addition to our subsidiaries and equity accounted investments, we consider key management personnel, the Board of 
Directors and material shareholders to be related parties. See additional details in Note 27.
g)  Operating Assets 
i.  Investment Properties 
The company uses the fair value method to account for real estate classified as investment properties. A property is determined 
to be an investment property when it is principally held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. 
Investment properties also include properties that are under development or redevelopment for future use as investment 
property. Investment properties are initially measured at cost including transaction costs, or at fair value if acquired in a 
135    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
business combination. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are carried at fair value. Gains or losses arising 
from changes in fair value are included in net income during the period in which they arise.
Fair values are completed by undertaking one of two accepted approaches: (i) discounting the expected future cash flows, 
generally over a term of 10 years including a terminal value based on the application of a capitalization rate to estimated      
year 11 net operating income, typically used for our office, retail and logistics assets; or (ii) undertaking a direct capitalization 
approach for certain of our LP investments and directly held multifamily assets whereby a capitalization rate is applied to 
estimated stabilized annual net operating income. The future cash flows of each property are based upon, among other things, 
rental income from current leases and assumptions about rental income from future leases reflecting current conditions, less 
future cash outflows relating to such current and future leases. 
Commercial developments are also measured using a discounted cash flow model, net of costs to complete, as of the balance 
sheet date. Development sites in the planning phases are carried at cost.
ii.  Property, Plant and Equipment 
The company uses the revaluation method of accounting for certain classes of property, plant and equipment as well as certain 
assets which are under development for future use as PP&E. PP&E measured using the revaluation method is initially 
measured at cost, or at fair value if acquired in a business combination, and subsequently carried at its revalued amount, being 
the fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Revaluations are performed on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year, commencing in the first year subsequent to 
the date of acquisition, unless there is an indication that assets are impaired. Where the carrying amount of an asset increases as 
a result of a revaluation, the increase is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in revaluation 
surplus, unless the increase reverses a previously recognized revaluation loss recorded through net income, in which case that 
portion of the increase is recognized in net income. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset decreases, the decrease is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent of 
any balance existing in revaluation surplus in respect of the asset, with the remainder of the decrease recognized in net income. 
Depreciation of an asset commences when it is available for use. On loss of control or partial disposition of an asset measured 
using the revaluation method, all accumulated revaluation surplus or the portion disposed of, respectively, is transferred into 
retained earnings or ownership changes, respectively.
PP&E held in our Private Equity segment, which include leasehold improvements, are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Land is carried at cost whereas finite-life assets such as buildings and 
equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is 
calculated on a systematic basis over the assets’ useful life.
Depreciation methods and useful lives are reassessed at least annually regardless of the measurement method used. 
Renewable Power 
Renewable power generally determines the fair value of its PP&E by using a 20-year discounted cash flow model for the 
majority of its assets. This model incorporates future cash flows from long-term power purchase agreements that are in place 
where it is determined that the power purchase agreements are linked specifically to the related power generating assets. The 
model also includes estimates of future electricity prices, anticipated long-term average generation, estimated operating and 
capital expenditures, and assumptions about future inflation rates and discount rates by geographical location. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    136 
Depreciation on renewable power generating assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the 
assets, which are as follows: 
Useful Lives
(YEARS)
Dams.................................................................................................................................................................................... Up to 115
Penstocks............................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 60
Powerhouses........................................................................................................................................................................ Up to 115
Hydroelectric generating units............................................................................................................................................ Up to 115
Wind generating units......................................................................................................................................................... Up to 30
Solar generating units.......................................................................................................................................................... Up to 35
Gas-fired cogenerating (“Cogeneration”) units................................................................................................................... Up to 40
Other assets......................................................................................................................................................................... Up to 60
Cost is allocated to the significant components of power generating assets and each component is depreciated separately. 
The depreciation of PP&E in our Brazilian renewable power operations is based on the duration of the authorization or the 
useful life of a concession. The weighted-average remaining duration at December 31, 2020 is 32 years (2019 – 32 years). Land 
rights are included as part of the concession or authorization and are subject to depreciation.
Infrastructure 
Utilities, transport, midstream and data assets within our infrastructure operations as well as assets under development 
classified as PP&E on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are accounted for using the revaluation method. The company 
determines the fair value of its utilities, transport, midstream and data assets using discounted cash flow analyses, which 
include estimates of forecasted revenue, operating costs, maintenance and other capital expenditures. Valuations are performed 
internally on an annual basis. Discount rates are selected for each asset, giving consideration to the volatility and geography of 
its revenue streams.
Depreciation on utilities, transport, midstream and data assets is calculated on a straight-line or declining balance basis over the 
estimated service lives of the components of the assets, which are as follows: 
Useful Lives
(YEARS)
Buildings............................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 75
Transmission stations, towers and related fixtures.............................................................................................................. Up to 40
Leasehold improvements..................................................................................................................................................... Up to 50
Plant and equipment............................................................................................................................................................ Up to 40
Network systems................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 65
Track.................................................................................................................................................................................... Up to 40
District energy systems....................................................................................................................................................... Up to 50
Pipelines.............................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 20
Gas storage assets................................................................................................................................................................ Up to 50
The fair value and the estimated remaining service lives are reassessed annually. 
Public service concessions that provide the right to charge users for a service in which the service and fee is regulated by the 
grantor are accounted for as intangible assets. 
In our sustainable resources operations, land used in the production of standing timber, as well as bridges and roads used in 
sustainable resources production, are accounted for using the revaluation method and included in PP&E. Bridges, roads and 
equipment are depreciated over their useful lives, generally 3 to 30 years. 
Real Estate – Hospitality Assets 
Hospitality operating assets within our real estate operations are classified as PP&E and are accounted for using the revaluation 
method. The company determines the fair value for these assets by using a depreciated replacement cost method based on the 
age, physical condition and the construction costs of the assets. Fair value of hospitality properties are also reviewed in 
reference to each hospitality asset’s enterprise value which is determined using a discounted cash flow model. 
137    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Depreciation on hospitality assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of the 
asset as follows: 
Useful Lives
(YEARS)
Building and building improvements.................................................................................................................................. 5 to 50 +
Land improvements............................................................................................................................................................. 15
Furniture, fixtures and equipment....................................................................................................................................... 2 to 15
Private Equity
The company accounts for its private equity PP&E using the cost model. Costs include expenditures that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation of an asset commences when it is available for use. PP&E is 
depreciated for each component of the following asset classes as follows:
On a straight-line basis (YEARS) Useful Lives
Buildings............................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 50
Leasehold improvements..................................................................................................................................................... Up to 40
Machinery and equipment................................................................................................................................................... Up to 20
Vessels................................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 35
Not on a straight-line basis Useful Lives
Oil and gas related equipment................................................................................................................................. Units of production
iii.  Inventory
Private Equity
Fuel inventories within our Private Equity segment are traded in active markets and are purchased with the view to resell in the 
near future, generating a profit from fluctuations in prices or margins. As a result, fuel inventories are carried at market value 
by reference to prices in a quoted active market, in accordance with the commodity broker-trader exemption granted by IAS 2, 
Inventories. Changes in fair value less costs to sell are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations through direct 
costs. Fuel products that are held for extended periods in order to benefit from future anticipated increases in fuel prices or 
located in territories where no active market exists are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Products and 
chemicals used in the production of biofuels are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Real Estate 
Develop-for-sale multifamily projects, residential development lots, homes and residential condominium projects are recorded 
in inventory. Residential development lots are recorded at the lower of cost, which includes pre-development expenditures and 
capitalized borrowing costs and net realizable value, which the company determines as the estimated selling price of the 
inventory in the ordinary course of business in its completed state, less estimated expenses, including holding costs, costs to 
complete and costs to sell. 
Homes and other properties held for sale, which include properties subject to sale agreements, are recorded at the lower of cost 
and net realizable value in inventory. Costs are allocated to the salable acreage of each project or subdivision in proportion to 
the anticipated revenue. 
Residential Development
Inventories consist of land held for development, land under development, homes under construction, completed homes and 
model homes. In addition to direct land acquisitions, land development and improvement costs and home construction costs, 
costs also include interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction, which are capitalized 
to inventory during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of 
construction or development. Indirect costs are allocated to homes or lots based on the number of units in a community.
Land and housing assets are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which the company determines as the 
estimated selling price of the inventory in the ordinary course of business in its completed state, less estimated expenses, 
including holding costs, costs to complete and costs to sell.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    138 
h)  Fair Value Measurement 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another 
valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the company takes into account the characteristics of 
the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the 
measurement date. 
Fair value measurement is disaggregated into three hierarchical levels: Level 1, 2 or 3. Fair value hierarchical levels are directly 
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurement are observable. The levels are as follows: 
Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. 
Level 2 – Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or 
liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the asset or liability’s 
anticipated life. 
Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the 
asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and 
the risk inherent in the inputs in determining the estimate. 
Refer to the investment properties and revaluation of PP&E explanations for the approach taken to determine the fair value of 
these operating assets.
Further information on fair value measurements is available in Notes 6, 7, 11 and 12. 
i)  Accounts Receivable 
Trade receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method, less an allowance for expected credit losses for uncollectability. 
j)  Intangible Assets 
Finite life intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses 
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization is recorded within depreciation and 
amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Certain of the company’s intangible assets have an indefinite life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the 
asset is expected to generate cash flows. Indefinite life intangible assets are recorded at cost unless an impairment is identified 
which requires a write-down to its recoverable amount. 
Indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate there 
may be an impairment. Any impairment of the company’s indefinite life intangible assets is recorded in net income in the 
period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses on intangible assets may be subsequently reversed in net 
income. 
Infrastructure
Intangible assets within our Infrastructure segment primarily consist of conservancy rights, service concession arrangements, 
customer  order  backlogs,  track  access  rights,  operating  network  agreements  and  customer  contracts  and  relationships. 
Concession arrangements, accounted for as intangible assets under IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements (“IFRIC 12”), 
were mostly acquired through acquisitions of gas transmission, electricity transmission and toll road businesses and are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
The intangible assets at the Brazilian regulated gas transmission operation and Brazilian electricity transmission operation 
relate to concession contracts, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contractual agreement. The 
intangible assets at the Chilean, Indian and Peruvian toll roads relate to the right to operate a road and charge users a specified 
tariff for a contractual length of time and is amortized over the life of the contractual arrangement with an average of 13, 16 and 
22 years remaining, respectively.
Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these concession arrangements.
The intangible assets at our residential infrastructure operation are comprised of contractual customer relationships, customer 
contracts, proprietary technology and brands. The contractual customer relationships and customer contracts represent ongoing 
economic benefits from leasing customers and annuity-based management agreements. Proprietary technology is recognized 
139    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
for the development of new metering technology, which allows the business to generate revenue through its sub-metering 
business. Brands represent the intrinsic value customers place on the operation’s various brand names.
Private Equity
Our private equity operations include intangible assets across a number of operating companies. The majority are finite life 
intangible assets that are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following useful lives:
Useful Lives
(YEARS)
Water and sewage concession agreements.......................................................................................................................... Up to 40
Brand names........................................................................................................................................................................ Up to 20
Computer software.............................................................................................................................................................. Up to 10
Customer relationships........................................................................................................................................................ Up to 30
Value of insurance contracts acquired................................................................................................................................ Up to 15
Patents and trademarks........................................................................................................................................................ Up to 40
Proprietary technology........................................................................................................................................................ Up to 20
Product development costs.................................................................................................................................................. Up to 5
Distribution networks.......................................................................................................................................................... Up to 25
Loyalty program.................................................................................................................................................................. Up to 15
Real Estate
Intangible assets in our Real Estate segment are primarily trademarks associated with hospitality assets. These trademarks have 
indefinite lives.
k)  Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for the acquisition of an entity over the fair value of the net identifiable 
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit to which it relates. The 
company identifies cash-generating units as identifiable groups of assets that are largely independent of the cash inflows from 
other assets or groups of assets.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing if the carrying value of a cash-generating unit, including the allocated 
goodwill, exceeds its recoverable amount determined as the greater of the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the value in 
use. Impairment losses recognized in respect of a cash-generating unit are first allocated to the carrying value of goodwill and 
any excess is allocated to the carrying amount of assets in the cash-generating unit. Any goodwill impairment is recorded in 
income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed. On 
disposal of a subsidiary, any attributable amount of goodwill is included in determination of the gain or loss on disposal. 
l)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
At each balance sheet date or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment, the company assesses 
whether its assets, other than those measured at fair value with changes in value recorded in net income, have any indication of 
impairment. An impairment is recognized if the recoverable amount, determined as the higher of the estimated fair value less 
costs of disposal and the discounted future cash flows generated from use and eventual disposal from an asset or cash-
generating unit, is less than their carrying value. Impairment losses are recorded as fair value changes within the Consolidated 
Statements  of  Operations.  The  projections  of  future  cash  flows  take  into  account  the  relevant  operating  plans  and 
management’s best estimate of the most probable set of conditions anticipated to prevail. Where an impairment loss 
subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the lesser of the revised estimate 
of  its  recoverable  amount  and  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  recorded  had  no  impairment  loss  been 
recognized previously. 
m)  Subsidiary Equity Obligations 
Subsidiary equity obligations include subsidiary preferred equity units, subsidiary preferred shares and capital securities as well 
as limited-life funds and redeemable fund units. 
Subsidiary preferred equity units and capital securities are preferred shares that may be settled by a variable number of 
common equity units upon their conversion by the holders or the company. These instruments, as well as the related accrued 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    140 
distributions, are classified as liabilities at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividends or yield distributions 
on these instruments are recorded as interest expense. To the extent conversion features are not closely related to the underlying 
liability the instruments are bifurcated into debt and equity components. 
Limited-life funds represent the interests of others in the company’s consolidated funds that have a defined maximum fixed life 
where the company has an obligation to distribute the residual interests of the fund to fund partners based on their proportionate 
share of the fund’s equity in the form of cash or other financial assets at cessation of the fund’s life. 
Redeemable fund units represent interests of others in consolidated subsidiaries that have a redemption feature that requires the 
company to deliver cash or other financial assets to the holders of the units upon receiving a redemption notice. 
Limited-life funds and redeemable fund units are classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value within subsidiary equity 
obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value are recorded in net income in the period of the 
change. 
n)  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”), specifies how and when revenue should be recognized and 
requires disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from customer 
contracts. 
Where available, the company has elected the practical expedient available under IFRS 15 for measuring progress toward 
complete satisfaction of performance obligation and for disclosure requirements of remaining performance obligations. This 
permits the company to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice such that the company has a 
right to the consideration in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer for performance completed to 
date. 
Revenue Recognition Policies by Segment
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service (or a bundle of 
goods and services) to the customer and is the unit of account in IFRS 15. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each 
distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue, as, or when, the performance obligation is satisfied. The company 
recognizes revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. 
The company recognizes revenue from the following major sources: 
Asset Management
The company’s primary asset management revenue streams, which include base management fees, incentive fees (including 
incentive distributions and performance fees) and realized carried interest, are satisfied over time. A significant portion of our 
asset management revenue is inter-segment in nature and thus eliminated on consolidation; that which survives is recorded as 
revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The company earns base management fees in accordance with contractual arrangements with our long-term private funds, 
perpetual strategies and public securities’ investment vehicles. Fees are typically equal to a percentage of fee-bearing capital 
within the respective fund or entity and are accrued quarterly. These fees are earned over the period of time that the 
management services are provided and are allocated to the distinct services provided by the company during the reporting 
period.
Incentive distributions and performance fees are incentive payments to reward the company for meeting or exceeding certain 
performance thresholds of managed entities. Incentive distributions, paid to us by our listed affiliates, are determined by 
contractual arrangements and represent a portion of distributions paid by the listed affiliates above a predetermined hurdle. 
They are accrued as revenue on the respective affiliates’ distribution record dates if that hurdle has been achieved. BBU pays 
performance fees if the growth in its unit price exceeds a predetermined threshold, with the unit price based on the quarterly 
volume-weighted average price of publicly traded units. These fees are accrued on a quarterly basis subject to the performance 
of the listed vehicle.
Carried interest is a performance fee arrangement in which we receive a percentage of investment returns, generated within a 
private fund on carry eligible capital, based on a contractual formula. We are eligible to earn carried interest from a fund once 
returns exceed the fund’s contractually defined performance hurdles at which point we earn an accelerated percentage of the 
additional fund profit until we have earned the percentage of total fund profit, net of fees and expenses, to which we are 
entitled. We recognize this carried interest when a fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of preferred returns and when it is 
141    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur, which are generally met when an underlying fund investment is 
profitably disposed of. Typically carried interest is not recognized as revenue until the fund is near the end of its life.
Real Estate
Revenue from hospitality operations is generated by providing accommodation, food and beverage and leisure facilities to hotel 
guests. Revenue from accommodation is recognized over the period that the guest stays at the hotel; food and beverage revenue 
as well as revenue from leisure activities is recognized when goods and services are provided.
Real estate rental income is recognized in accordance with IFRS 16, Leases. As the company retains substantially all the risks 
and benefits of ownership of its investment properties, it accounts for leases with its tenants as operating leases and begins 
recognizing revenue when the tenant has a right to use the leased asset. The total amount of contractual rent to be received from 
operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease; a straight-line or free rent receivable, as 
applicable, is recorded as a component of investment property representing the difference between rental revenue recorded and 
the contractual amount received. Percentage participating rents are recognized when tenants’ specified sales targets have been 
met. 
Renewable Power
Revenue is earned by selling electricity sourced from our power generating facilities. It is derived from the output delivered and 
capacity provided at rates specified under contract terms or at prevailing market rates if the sale is uncontracted. Performance 
obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits as we deliver electricity and 
related products. 
We also sell power and related products under bundled arrangements. Energy, capacity and renewable credits within power 
purchase agreements (“PPA”) are considered to be distinct performance obligations. A contract’s transaction price is allocated 
to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue over time as the performance obligation is satisfied. The sale 
of energy and capacity are distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer as measured by 
the output method. Renewable credits are performance obligations satisfied at a point in time. Measurement of satisfaction and 
transfer of control to the customer of renewable credits in a bundled arrangement coincides with the pattern of revenue 
recognition of the underlying energy generation.
Infrastructure
Our infrastructure revenue is predominantly recognized over time as services are rendered. Performance obligations are 
satisfied based on actual usage or throughput depending on the terms of the arrangement. Contract progress is determined using 
a cost-to-cost input method. Any upfront payments that are separable from the recurring revenue are recognized over time for 
the period the services are provided.
In addition, we have certain contracts where we earn revenue at a point in time when control of the product ultimately transfers 
to the customer, which for our sustainable resources operations coincides with product delivery.
Private Equity
Revenue from our private equity operations primarily consists of: (i) sale of goods or products which is recognized as revenue 
when the product is shipped and title passes to the customer; and (ii) the provision of services which are recognized 
as revenue over the period of time that they are provided. 
Revenue recognized over a period of time is determined using the cost-to-cost input method to measure progress towards 
complete satisfaction of the performance obligations as the work performed on the contracts creates or enhances an asset that is 
controlled by the customer. As work is performed, a contract asset in the form of contracts-in-progress is recognized, which 
is reclassified to accounts receivable when invoiced to the customer. If payment is received in advance of work being 
completed, a contract liability is recognized. Variable consideration, such as claims, incentives and variations resulting from 
contract modifications, is only recognized in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    142 
Residential Development
Revenue from residential land sales, sales of homes and the completion of residential condominium projects is recognized at 
the point in time when our performance obligations are met. Performance obligations are satisfied when we transfer title over a 
product to a customer and all material conditions of the sales contract have been met. If title of a property transfers but material 
future development is required, revenue will be delayed until the point in time at which the remaining performance obligations 
are satisfied.
Corporate Activities and Other
Dividend and interest income from other financial assets are recognized as revenue when declared or on an accrual basis using 
the effective interest method, in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”).
Interest revenue from loans and notes receivable, less a provision for uncollectable amounts, is recorded on the accrual basis 
using the effective interest method, in accordance with IFRS 9.
o)  Financial Instruments 
Classification of Financial Instruments
The company classifies its financial assets as fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), fair value through other 
comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) and amortized cost according to the company’s business objectives for managing the 
financial assets and based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The company classifies its 
financial liabilities as amortized cost or FVTPL. 
• Financial instruments that are not held for the sole purpose of collecting contractual cash flows are classified as FVTPL 
and are initially recognized at their fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. Gains and 
losses recorded on each revaluation date are recognized within net earnings. Transaction costs of financial assets classified 
as FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.
• Financial assets classified as FVTOCI are initially recognized at their fair value and are subsequently measured at fair 
value at each reporting date. The cumulative gains or losses related to FVTOCI equity instruments are not reclassified to 
profit or loss on disposal, whereas the cumulative gains or losses on all other FVTOCI assets are reclassified to profit or 
loss on disposal, when there is a significant or prolonged decline in fair value or when the company acquires a controlling 
or significant interest in the underlying investment and commences equity accounting or consolidating the investment. The 
cumulative gains or losses on all FVTOCI liabilities are reclassified to profit or loss on disposal.
• Financial instruments that are held for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest are classified as amortized cost and are initially recognized at their fair value and are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs of financial instruments classified as 
amortized cost are capitalized and amortized in profit or loss on the same basis as the financial instrument.
Expected credit losses associated with debt instruments carried at amortized cost and FVOCI are assessed on a forward-looking 
basis. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. Impairment charges are recognized in profit or loss based on the expected credit loss model.

1. Includes derivative instruments.
Other Financial Assets
Other financial assets are recognized on their trade date and initially recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded 
in net income or other comprehensive income in accordance with their classification. Fair values of financial instruments are 
determined by reference to quoted bid or ask prices, as appropriate. Where bid and ask prices are unavailable, the closing price 
of the most recent transaction of that instrument is used. 
Other financial assets also include loans and notes receivable which are recorded initially at fair value and, with the exception 
of loans and notes receivable designated as FVTPL, are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method, less any applicable provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective 
evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Loans 
and receivables designated as FVTPL are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in the period 
in which they arise.
Allowance for Credit Losses
For financial assets classified as amortized cost or debt instruments as FVTOCI, at each reporting period, the company assesses 
if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the asset was originated to determine if a 12-month expected credit 
loss or a life-time expected credit loss should be recorded regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. The 
company uses unbiased, probability-weighted loss scenarios which consider multiple loss scenarios based on reasonable and 
supportable forecasts in order to calculate the expected credit losses. 
The company assesses the carrying value of FVTOCI and amortized cost securities for impairment when there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired such as when an asset is in default. Impaired financial assets continue to record life-time 
expected credit losses; however interest revenue is calculated based on the net amortized carrying amount after deducting the 
loss  allowance.  When  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists,  losses  arising  from  impairment  are  reclassified  from 
accumulated other comprehensive income to net income.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    144 
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting 
The company selectively utilizes derivative financial instruments primarily to manage financial risks, including interest rate, 
commodity and foreign exchange risks. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value within the company’s 
consolidated financial statements. Hedge accounting is applied when the derivative is designated as a hedge of a specific 
exposure and there is assurance that it will continue to be effective as a hedge based on an expectation of offsetting cash flows 
or fair values. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the derivative no longer qualifies as a hedge or the 
hedging relationship is terminated. Once discontinued, the cumulative change in fair value of a derivative that was previously 
recorded in other comprehensive income by the application of hedge accounting is recognized in net income over the remaining 
term of the original hedging relationship. The assets or liabilities relating to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on 
derivative financial instruments are recorded in accounts receivable and other or accounts payable and other, respectively. 
Items Classified as Hedges 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of currency risks relating to a net 
investment in a subsidiary or an associate are included in equity. Gains or losses are reclassified into net income in the period in 
which the subsidiary or associate is disposed of or to the extent that the hedges are ineffective. Where a subsidiary is partially 
disposed, and control is retained, any associated gains or costs are reclassified within equity to ownership changes. Derivative 
financial instruments that are designated as hedges to offset corresponding changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities and 
cash flows are measured at their estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net income or as a component of 
equity, as applicable. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate contracts designated as hedges of future variable interest 
payments  are  included  in  equity  as  a  cash  flow  hedge  when  the  interest  rate  risk  relates  to  an  anticipated  variable 
interest payment. The periodic exchanges of payments on interest rate swap contracts designated as hedges of debt are recorded 
on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense. The periodic exchanges of payments on interest rate contracts 
designated as hedges of future interest payments are amortized into net income over the term of the corresponding interest 
payments. Unrealized gains and losses on electricity contracts designated as cash flow hedges of future power generation 
revenue are included in equity as a cash flow hedge. The periodic exchanges of payments on power generation commodity 
swap contracts designated as hedges are recorded on a settlement basis as an adjustment to power generation revenue.
Items Not Classified as Hedges 
Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are carried at their estimated fair value, and gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value are recognized in net income in the period in which the change occurs. Realized and 
unrealized gains and losses on equity derivatives used to offset changes in share prices in respect of vested deferred share units 
and restricted share units are recorded together with the corresponding compensation expense. Realized and unrealized gains on 
other derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in revenues, direct costs or corporate costs, as applicable. Realized and 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives which are considered economic hedges, and where hedge accounting is not able to be 
elected, are recorded in fair value changes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
p)  Income Taxes 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to tax authorities, net of recoveries, 
based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current and deferred income tax 
relating to items recognized directly in equity are also recognized in equity. Deferred income tax liabilities are provided for 
using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and for the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that deductions, tax credits and tax losses can be utilized. The 
carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent it is no longer 
probable that the income tax assets will be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
q)  Business Combinations 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets that are classified as held for sale which 
are recognized and measured at fair value less costs to sell. The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is 
initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognized. 
145    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
To the extent the fair value of consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets, the 
excess is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of consideration paid is less than the fair value of net identifiable 
tangible and intangible assets, the excess is recognized in net income. 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, previously held interests in the acquired entity are re-measured to fair value 
at the acquisition date, which is the date control is obtained, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in net income, 
other than amounts transferred directly to retained earnings. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to net income. 
Transaction costs are recorded as an expense within fair value changes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
r)  Leases
The company accounts for leases under IFRS 16 Leases (“IFRS 16”). Under IFRS 16, the company must assess whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease at inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control exists if a customer can make the 
important decisions governing the use of an asset specified in a contract similar to decisions made over assets owned by the 
business. The company has elected to not allocate contract consideration between lease and non-lease components, but rather 
account for each lease and non-lease component as a single lease component. This election is made by asset class.
For lessors, a lease shall be classified as either a finance or operating lease on commencement of the lease contract. If the 
contract represents a finance lease in which the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the lessee, a lessor shall 
recognize a finance lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease. Subsequently, finance income is recognized at a constant rate on the net investment of the finance lease. 
Lease payments received from operating leases shall be recognized into income on a straight-line or other systematic basis.
For lessees, the company recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The 
ROU asset is initially measured based on the calculated lease liability plus initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, estimates 
to dismantle and restore the underlying asset at the end of the lease term and lease payments made net of incentives received at 
or before the lease commencement date. It is classified as either investment PP&E, or inventory depending on the nature of the 
asset and is subsequently accounted for consistently with owned assets within the respective asset classes with the exception of 
PP&E. Unlike most of the company’s owned assets within PP&E, lease assets classified within PP&E are subsequently 
measured applying the cost method rather than the revaluation method. The ROU asset is depreciated applying a straight-line 
method or other systematic basis over the shorter of the useful life of the underlying asset or the term of the lease. Lease 
contracts often include an option to extend the term of the lease and such extensions are factored into the lease term if the 
company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. ROU assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, 
Impairment of Assets. Refer to section (g) above for additional details of our accounting policies governing investment 
properties, PP&E and inventory.
Lease liabilities are classified within accounts payable and other and are recognized at the commencement of the lease, initially 
measured at the present value of future lease payments not paid as at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate 
implicit in the lease, or the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate if the implicit rate cannot be readily determined. Lease 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost by applying the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured if there is reassessment of the timing or amount of future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, 
revisions to estimates of the lease term or residual value guarantee, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset. Such remeasurements of the lease liability are generally recognized as an adjustment to the ROU asset unless 
further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability would reduce a ROU asset below zero, in which case it is recorded in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the ROU 
asset. The related payments are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those 
payments occurs and are classified within direct costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We are applying certain practical expedients as permitted by the standard; specifically, we have elected to apply practical 
expedients associated with short-term and low-value leases that allow the company to record operating expenses on such leases 
on a straight-line basis without having to capitalize the lease arrangement. 
We have also applied a number of critical judgments in applying this standard, including: i) identifying whether a contract (or 
part of a contract) includes a lease; ii) determining whether it is reasonably certain that lease extension or termination options 
will be exercised in determining the lease term; and iii) determining whether variable payments are in-substance fixed. Critical 
estimates used in the application of IFRS 16 include estimating the lease term and determining the appropriate rate at which to 
discount the lease payments.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    146 
s)  Other Items 
i.  Capitalized Costs 
Capitalized costs related to assets under development and redevelopment include all eligible expenditures incurred in 
connection with the acquisition, development and construction of the asset until it is available for its intended use. These 
expenditures consist of costs that are directly attributable to these assets.
Borrowing costs are capitalized when such costs are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a 
qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is an asset that takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use. 
ii.  Share-based Payments 
The company issues share-based awards to certain employees and non-employee directors. The cost of equity-settled share-
based transactions, comprised of share options, restricted shares and escrowed shares, is determined as the fair value of the 
award on the grant date using a fair value model. The cost of equity-settled share-based transactions is recognized as each 
tranche vests and is recorded in contributed surplus as a component of equity. The cost of cash-settled share-based transactions, 
comprised of Deferred Share Units (“DSUs”) and Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”), is measured as the fair value at the grant 
date, and expensed on a proportionate basis consistent with the vesting features over the vesting period with the recognition of 
a corresponding liability. The liability is recorded as a provision within accounts payable and other and measured at each 
reporting date at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
iii.  Provisions 
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing that is recognized when the company has a present obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of 
the amount of the obligation. The company’s significant provisions consist of pensions and other long-term and post-
employment benefits, warranties on some products or services, obligations to retire or decommission tangible long-lived assets 
and the cost of legal claims arising in the normal course of operations. 
a.  Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
The company offers pension and other post-employment benefit plans to employees of certain of its subsidiaries, with certain 
of these subsidiaries offering defined benefit plans. Defined benefit pension expenses, which include the current year’s service 
cost, are included in direct costs. For each defined benefit plan, we recognize the present value of our defined benefit 
obligations less the fair value of the plan assets as a defined benefit liability reported in accounts payable and other on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The company’s obligations under its defined benefit pension plans are determined periodically 
through the preparation of actuarial valuations. 
b.  Other Long-Term Incentive Plans 
The company provides long-term incentive plans to certain employees whereby the company allocates a portion of the amounts 
realized through subsidiary profit-sharing agreements to its employees. The cost of these plans is recognized over the requisite 
service period, provided it is probable that the vesting conditions will be achieved, based on the underlying subsidiary profit 
sharing arrangement. The liability is recorded within accounts payable and other and measured at each reporting date with the 
corresponding expense recognized in direct costs. 
c.  Warranties, Asset Retirement, Legal and Other 
Certain consolidated entities offer warranties on the sale of products or services. A provision is recorded to provide for future 
warranty costs based on management’s best estimate of probable warranty claims. 
Certain consolidated entities have legal obligations to retire tangible long-lived assets. A provision is recorded at each reporting 
date to provide for the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation upon decommissioning of the asset period. 
In the normal course of operations, the company may become involved in legal proceedings. Management analyzes information 
about these legal matters and provides provisions for probable contingent losses, including estimated legal expenses to resolve 
the matters. Internal and external legal counsel are used in order to estimate the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the 
amount of loss. 
147    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
t)  Critical Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carried amounts 
of certain assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses recorded during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
In making estimates and judgments, management relies on external information and observable conditions, where possible, 
supplemented by internal analysis as required. These estimates and judgments have been applied in a manner consistent with 
prior periods and there are no known trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that the company believes will materially 
affect the methodology or assumptions utilized in making estimates and judgments in these consolidated financial statements. 
i.  Critical Estimates 
The significant estimates used in determining the recorded amount for assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial 
statements include the following:
a.  Investment Properties 
The critical assumptions and estimates used when determining the fair value of commercial properties are: discount rates and 
terminal capitalization rates for properties valued using a discounted cash flow model and capitalization rates for properties 
valued using a direct capitalization approach. Management also uses assumptions and estimates in determining expected future 
cash flows in discounted cash flow models and stabilized net operating income used in values determined using the direct 
capitalization approach. Properties under development are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model which 
includes estimates in respect of the timing and cost to complete the development. 
Further information on investment property estimates is provided in Note 11. 
b.  Revaluation Method for Property, Plant and Equipment 
When determining the carrying value of PP&E using the revaluation method, the company uses the following critical 
assumptions and estimates: the timing of forecasted revenues; future sales prices and associated expenses; future sales volumes; 
future regulatory rates; maintenance and other capital expenditures; discount rates; terminal capitalization rates; terminal 
valuation dates; useful lives; and residual values. Determination of the fair value of PP&E under development includes 
estimates in respect of the timing and cost to complete the development. 
Further information on estimates used in the revaluation method for PP&E is provided in Note 12. 
c.  Financial Instruments 
Estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of financial instruments are: equity and commodity prices; future 
interest rates; the credit worthiness of the company relative to its counterparties; the credit risk of the company’s counterparties; 
estimated future cash flows; the amount of the liability and equity components of compound financial instruments; discount 
rates and volatility utilized in option valuations. 
Further information on estimates used in determining the carrying value of financial instruments is provided in Notes 6 and 25.
d.  Inventory 
The company estimates the net realizable value of its inventory using estimates and assumptions about future development 
costs, costs to hold and future selling costs. 
e.  Other 
Other estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements are: the 
assessment or determination of net recoverable amount; oil and gas reserves; depreciation and amortization rates and useful 
lives; estimation of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units for impairment assessments of goodwill and intangible assets; 
ability to utilize tax losses and other tax measurements; fair value of assets held as collateral and the percentage of completion 
for construction contracts. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    148 
ii.  Critical Judgments 
Management is required to make critical judgments when applying its accounting policies. The following judgments have the 
most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements: 
a.  Control or Level of Influence 
When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the company’s investees, the company makes judgments about the 
degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees’ relevant activities. This may include 
the ability to elect investee directors or appoint management. Control is obtained when the company has the power to direct the 
relevant investing, financing and operating decisions of an entity and does so in its capacity as principal of the operations, 
rather than as an agent for other investors. Operating as a principal includes having sufficient capital at risk in any investee and 
exposure to the variability of the returns generated as a result of the decisions of the company as principal. Judgment is used in 
determining the sufficiency of the capital at risk or variability of returns. In making these judgments, the company considers the 
ability of other investors to remove the company as a manager or general partner in a controlled partnership. 
b.  Investment Properties 
When applying the company’s accounting policy for investment properties, judgment is applied in determining whether certain 
costs are additions to the carrying amount of the property and, for properties under development, identifying the point at which 
practical completion of the property occurs and identifying the directly attributable borrowing costs to be included in the 
carrying value of the development property. 
c.  Property, Plant and Equipment 
The company’s accounting policy for its PP&E requires critical judgments over the assessment of carrying value, whether 
certain costs are additions to the carrying amount of the PP&E as opposed to repairs and maintenance, and for assets under 
development the identification of when the asset is capable of being used as intended and identifying the directly attributable 
borrowing costs to be included in the asset’s carrying value. 
For assets that are measured using the revaluation method, judgment is required when estimating future prices, volumes, 
discount and capitalization rates. Judgment is applied when determining future electricity prices considering broker quotes for 
the years in which there is a liquid market available and, for the subsequent years, our best estimate of electricity prices from 
renewable sources that would allow new entrants into the market. 
d.  Identifying Performance Obligations for Revenue Recognition 
Management is required to identify performance obligations relating to contracts with customers at the inception of each 
contract.  IFRS  15  requires  a  contract’s  transaction  price  to  be  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  and 
subsequently recognized into income when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Judgment is used when assessing the 
pattern of delivery of the product or service to determine if revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time. For 
certain service contracts recognized over time, judgment is required to determine if revenue from variable consideration such as 
incentives, claims and variations from contract modifications has met the required probability threshold to be recognized.
Management also uses judgment to determine whether contracts for the sale of products and services have distinct performance 
obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation. Goods and services are considered 
distinct if: (1) a customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily 
available to the customer; and (2) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable 
from other promises in the contract.
Additional details about revenue recognition policies across our operating segments are included in Note 2(n) of the 
consolidated financial statements.
149    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
e.  Common Control Transactions 
The purchase and sale of businesses or subsidiaries between entities under common control are not specifically addressed in 
IFRS and accordingly, management uses judgment when determining a policy to account for such transactions taking into 
consideration other guidance in the IFRS framework and pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies. The company’s 
policy is to record assets and liabilities recognized as a result of transfers of businesses or subsidiaries between entities under 
common control at carrying value. Differences between the carrying amount of the consideration given or received and the 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities transferred are recorded directly in equity. 
f.  Indicators of Impairment 
Judgment is applied when determining whether indicators of impairment exist when assessing the carrying values of the 
company’s assets, including: the determination of the company’s ability to hold financial assets; the estimation of a cash-
generating unit’s future revenues and direct costs; the determination of discount and capitalization rates; and when an asset’s 
carrying value is above the value derived using publicly traded prices which are quoted in a liquid market. 
g.  Income Taxes 
The company makes judgments when determining the future tax rates applicable to subsidiaries and identifying the temporary 
differences that relate to each subsidiary. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply during the period when the assets are realized or the liabilities settled, using the tax rates and laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the consolidated balance sheet dates. The company measures deferred income taxes associated with its 
investment properties based on its specific intention with respect to each asset at the end of the reporting period. Where the 
company has a specific intention to sell a property in the foreseeable future, deferred taxes on the building portion of an 
investment property are measured based on the tax consequences that would follow the disposition of the property. Otherwise, 
deferred taxes are measured on the basis the carrying value of the investment property will be recovered substantially through 
use.
h.  Classification of Non-Controlling Interests in Limited-Life Funds 
Non-controlling interests in limited-life funds are classified as liabilities (subsidiary equity obligations) or equity (non-
controlling interests) depending on whether an obligation exists to distribute residual net assets to non-controlling interests on 
liquidation in the form of cash or another financial asset or assets delivered in kind. Judgment is required to determine what the 
governing documents of each entity require or permit in this regard. 
i.  Other 
Other critical judgments include the determination of effectiveness of financial hedges for accounting purposes; the likelihood 
and timing of anticipated transactions for hedge accounting; and the determination of functional currency.
3.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
a)    Operating Segments
Our operations are organized into our asset management and corporate segments, in addition to five operating business groups 
which collectively represent seven operating segments for internal and external reporting purposes. We use our common equity 
by segment to evaluate capital allocation decisions and measure performance using funds from operations (“FFO”).
Our operating segments are as follows:
The Corporation:
i. Asset management operations include managing our long-term private funds, perpetual strategies and public securities on 
behalf of our investors and ourselves, as well as our share of the asset management activities of Oaktree Capital 
Management (“Oaktree”). We generate contractual base management fees for these activities as well as incentive 
distributions and performance income, including performance fees, transaction fees and carried interest.   
ii. Corporate activities include the investment of cash and financial assets, as well as the management of our corporate 
leverage, including corporate borrowings and preferred equity, which fund a portion of the capital invested in our other 
operations. Certain corporate costs such as technology and operations are incurred on behalf of our operating segments and 
allocated to each operating segment based on an internal pricing framework. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    150 
Managed investments:
iii. Real estate operations include the ownership, operation and development of core office, core retail, LP investments and 
other properties. 
iv. Renewable power operations include the ownership, operation and development of hydroelectric, wind, solar and energy 
transition power generating facilities. 
v. Infrastructure operations include the ownership, operation and development of utilities, transport, midstream, data and 
sustainable resource assets. 
vi. Private equity operations include a broad range of industries, and are mostly focused on business services, infrastructure 
services and industrials. 
vii. Residential development operations consist of homebuilding, condominium development and land development. 
b)   Segment Financial Measures
FFO is a key measure of our financial performance and our segment measure of profit and loss. It is utilized by our Chief 
Operating Decision Maker in assessing operating results and the performance of our businesses on a segmented basis. 
We define FFO as net income excluding fair value changes, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, net of 
non-controlling interests. When determining FFO, we include our proportionate share of the FFO from equity accounted 
investments on a fully diluted basis. FFO also includes realized disposition gains and losses, which are gains or losses arising 
from transactions during the reporting period, adjusted to include associated fair value changes and revaluation surplus 
recorded in prior periods, taxes payable or receivable in connection with those transactions and amounts that are recorded 
directly in equity, such as ownership changes. 
We use FFO to assess our performance as an asset manager and as an investor in our assets. FFO from our Asset Management 
segment includes fees, net of the associated costs, that we earn from managing capital in our listed affiliates, private funds and 
public securities accounts. We are also eligible to earn incentive payments in the form of incentive distributions, performance 
fees or carried interest. As an investor in our assets, our FFO represents the company’s share of revenues less costs incurred 
within our operations, which include interest expenses and other costs. Specifically, it includes the impact of contracts that we 
enter into to generate revenues, including power sales agreements, contracts that our operating businesses enter into such as 
leases and take or pay contracts and sales of inventory. FFO includes the impact of changes in leverage or the cost of that 
financial leverage and other costs incurred to operate our business. 
We use realized disposition gains and losses within FFO in order to provide additional insight regarding the performance 
of investments on a cumulative realized basis, including any unrealized fair value adjustments that were recorded in equity and 
not otherwise reflected in current period FFO, and believe it is useful to investors to better understand variances between 
reporting periods. We exclude depreciation and amortization from FFO as we believe that the value of most of our assets 
typically increases over time, provided we make the necessary maintenance expenditures, the timing and magnitude of which 
may differ from the amount of depreciation recorded in any given period. In addition, the depreciated cost base of our assets is 
reflected in the ultimate realized disposition gain or loss on disposal. As noted above, unrealized fair value changes 
are excluded from FFO until the period in which the asset is sold. We also exclude deferred income taxes from FFO 
because the vast majority of the company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are a result of the revaluation of our assets 
under IFRS.
Our definition of FFO may differ from the definition used by other organizations, as well as the definition of FFO used by the 
Real Property Association of Canada (“REALPAC”) and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. 
(“NAREIT”), in part because the NAREIT definition is based on U.S. GAAP, as opposed to IFRS. The key differences 
between our definition of FFO and the determination of FFO by REALPAC and/or NAREIT are that we include the following: 
realized disposition gains or losses and cash taxes payable or receivable on those gains or losses, if any; foreign exchange gains 
or losses on monetary items not forming part of our net investment in foreign operations; and foreign exchange gains or losses 
on the sale of an investment in a foreign operation. We do not use FFO as a measure of cash generated from our operations. 
We illustrate how we derive FFO for each operating segment and reconcile total FFO to net income in Note 3(c)(v) of the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Segment Balance Sheet Information
We use common equity by segment as our measure of segment assets when reviewing our deconsolidated balance sheet 
because it is utilized by our Chief Operating Decision Maker for capital allocation decisions.
151    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
Segment Allocation and Measurement
Segment measures include amounts earned from consolidated entities that are eliminated on consolidation. The principal 
adjustment is to include asset management revenues charged to consolidated entities as revenues within the company’s Asset 
Management segment with the corresponding expense recorded as corporate costs within the relevant segment. These amounts 
are based on the in-place terms of the asset management contracts between the consolidated entities. Inter-segment revenues are 
determined under terms that approximate market value.
The company allocates the costs of shared functions that would otherwise be included within its Corporate Activities segment, 
such as information technology and internal audit, pursuant to formal policies.

Realized disposition gains include gains and losses recorded in net income arising from transactions during the current period, 
adjusted to include fair value changes and revaluation surplus recorded in prior periods in connection with the assets sold. 
Realized disposition gains also include amounts that are recorded directly in equity as changes in ownership, as opposed to net 
income, because they result from a change in ownership of a consolidated entity.
The realized disposition gains recorded in fair value changes, revaluation surplus or directly in equity were $1.6 billion for the 
year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 – $621 million), of which $499 million relates to prior periods (2019 – $284 million), 
$1.1 billion has been recorded directly in equity as changes in ownership (2019 – $258 million) and a loss of $29 million has 
been recorded in fair value changes (2019 – gain of $79 million).

Private Equity
During 2020, a subsidiary of the company, together with institutional partners, acquired a 57% ownership interest in IndoStar, 
an Indian financing company focused on commercial vehicle lending and affordable home finance. The transaction was 
accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages on May 27, July 8 and 9, 2020. The subsidiary’s previously held 
investment in IndoStar was remeasured to fair value prior to the acquisition of additional interests. The fair value approximated 
carrying value and no cumulative gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of the investment was recognized. Total 
consideration of $295 million was comprised of an existing equity interest of $276 million and $19 million of cash on hand. 
Total revenues and net loss that would have been recorded if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the year are 
$175 million and $37 million, respectively.
Infrastructure
On August 31, 2020, a subsidiary of the company, alongside institutional partners, acquired a 100% interest in an Indian 
telecom tower operation for a total of approximately $3.4 billion. Consideration paid was funded fully by cash on hand. 
Goodwill in the amount of $27 million was recognized, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. Total revenues and net 
income that would have been recorded if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the year are $1.1 billion and 
$9 million, respectively.

Brookfield recorded $7.6 billion of revenue and $635 million of net losses in 2019 from the acquired operations as a result of 
the acquisitions made during the year. If the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the year, they would have contributed  
$14.7 billion and $189 million to total revenue and net income, respectively. The difference in our net losses since acquisition 
date compared to net income had we held our investments since January 1 primarily relate to the timing of acquisitions during 
the year as those with large contributors to net income were purchased in late 2019. In addition, our post-acquisition margins 
were reduced from the step-up in inventory costs resulting from purchase price allocations as well as restructuring costs in 
certain of our acquisitions.

Fair values of financial instruments are determined by reference to quoted bid or ask prices, as appropriate. If bid and ask prices 
are unavailable, the closing price of the most recent transaction of that instrument is used. In the absence of an active market, 
fair values are determined based on prevailing market rates for instruments with similar characteristics and risk profiles or 
internal or external valuation models, such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis, using observable 
market inputs.
The following table summarizes the valuation techniques and key inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 2 
financial instruments:

Fair values determined using valuation models requiring the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3 financial assets and liabilities) 
include assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates. In determining those 
unobservable inputs, the company uses observable external market inputs such as interest rate yield curves, currency rates and 
price and rate volatilities, as applicable, to develop assumptions regarding those unobservable inputs.

d)  Hedging Activities 
The company uses derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments to manage or maintain exposures to interest, currency, 
credit and other market risks. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. For certain derivatives which are used 
to manage exposures, the company determines whether hedge accounting can be applied. Hedge accounting is applied when the 
derivative is designated as a hedge of a specific exposure and there is assurance that it will continue to be highly effective as a 
hedge based on an expectation of offsetting cash flows or fair value. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the 
derivative no longer qualifies as a hedge or the hedging relationship is terminated. Once discontinued, the cumulative change in 
fair value of a derivative that was previously recorded in other comprehensive income by the application of hedge accounting is 
recognized in profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship as amounts related to the hedged item 
are recognized in profit or loss. The assets or liabilities relating to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on derivative 
financial instruments are recorded in financial assets and financial liabilities, respectively.
i.  Cash Flow Hedges 
The company uses the following cash flow hedges: energy derivative contracts to hedge the sale of power; interest rate swaps 
to hedge the variability in cash flows or future cash flows related to a variable rate asset or liability; and equity derivatives 
to hedge long-term compensation arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2020, pre-tax net unrealized losses of 
$479 million (2019 – losses of $89 million) were recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the cash 
flow hedges. As at December 31, 2020, there was an unrealized derivative liability balance of $689 million relating to 
derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges (2019 – $210 million). 
ii.  Net Investment Hedges 
The company uses foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt instruments to manage its foreign 
currency exposures arising from net investments in foreign operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, unrealized pre-
tax net losses of $182 million  (2019 – gains of $433 million) were recorded in other comprehensive income for the 
effective portion of hedges of net investments in foreign operations. As at December 31, 2020, there was an unrealized 
derivative liability balance of $868 million relating to derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges (2019 – asset 
balance of $551 million).
e)  Netting of Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset with the net amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets where the company 
currently has a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. 
167    BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT
The company enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) master 
netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day are aggregated 
into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The agreements provide the company with the legal and 
enforceable right to offset these amounts and accordingly the following balances are presented net in the consolidated financial 
statements:

The carrying values are based on external appraisals completed annually as at December 31. The appraisals utilize a 
combination of the discounted cash flow and sales comparison approaches to arrive at the estimated value. The significant 
unobservable inputs (Level 3) included in the discounted cash flow models used when determining the fair value of standing 
timber and agricultural assets include:

Key valuation assumptions include a weighted-average discount and terminal capitalization rate of 4.6% (2019 – 6.1%), and 
terminal valuation dates of up to 18 years (2019 – 21 years). Timber and agricultural asset prices were based on a combination 
of forward prices available in the market and price forecasts.

of investment properties within our directly held Fairfield investment, a self-storage portfolio, and a core office asset in 
London. In addition, the current period includes the reclassification of a portfolio held within Forest City to assets held for sale.
Investment properties generated $5.7 billion (2019 – $5.8 billion) in rental income and incurred $2.5 billion (2019 –

1. Certain investment properties are valued using the direct capitalization method instead of a discounted cash flow model. Under the direct capitalization method, a 
capitalization rate is applied to estimated current year cash flows. 
The company’s investment properties are diversified by asset type, asset class, geography and market. Therefore, there may be 
mitigating factors in addition to those noted above such as changes to assumptions that vary in direction and magnitude across 
different geographies and markets.

would have been recognized had our assets been accounted for under the cost model is $59.0 billion (2019 – $51.7 billion). As 
at December 31, 2020, $80.2 billion (2019 – $66.3 billion) of property, plant and equipment, at cost, were pledged as collateral 
for the property debt at their respective properties.

1.  Terminal capitalization rate applies only to hydroelectric assets in North America and Colombia.
Terminal values are included in the valuation of hydroelectric assets in the U.S., Canada and Colombia. For the hydroelectric 
assets in Brazil, cash flows have been included based on the duration of the authorization or useful life of a concession asset 
without consideration of potential renewal value. The weighted-average remaining duration as at December 31, 2020, which 
includes a one-time 30-year renewal for applicable hydroelectric assets completed in the current year, is 32 years (2019 –       
32 years). Consequently, there is no terminal value attributed to the hydroelectric assets in Brazil.

The company’s real estate PP&E assets include hospitality assets accounted for under the revaluation model, with the most 
recent revaluation as at December 31, 2020. The company determined fair value for these assets by using the depreciated 
replacement cost method. Valuations utilize significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) when determining the fair value of real 
estate assets. The significant Level 3 inputs include estimates of assets’ replacement cost and remaining economic life.
d)  Private Equity
Private equity and other PP&E includes assets owned by the company’s private equity and residential development operations. 
These assets are accounted for under the cost model, which requires the assets to be carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The following table presents the changes to the carrying value of the 
company’s property, plant and equipment assets included in these operations:

a)  Infrastructure 
The intangible assets in our Infrastructure segment are primarily related to:
• Concession arrangements of $2.9 billion (2019 – $3.9 billion) at the company’s Brazilian regulated gas transmission 
operation that provide the right to charge a tariff over the term of the agreements. The agreements have an expiration date 
between 2039 and 2041, which is the basis for the company’s determination of the asset’s remaining useful life. Upon 
expiry of the agreements, the asset shall be returned to the government and the concession will be subject to a public 
bidding process. 
• Concession arrangements totaling $2.6 billion (2019 – $2.7 billion) relating to the company’s Peruvian, Chilean and Indian 
toll roads which provide the right to charge a tariff to users of the roads over the terms of the concessions. The Chilean and 
Peruvian concessions have expiration dates of 2033 and 2043, respectively, while the Indian concessions have an 
expiration date from 2026 to 2041. The company uses these expiration dates as a basis for determining the assets’ 
remaining useful lives. 
• Customer relationships, operating network agreements and track access rights of $1.9 billion (2019 – $2.0 billion) in our 
North American rail operations. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years.
• Contractual customer relationships, customer contracts and proprietary technology of $1.4 billion (2019 – $1.4 billion) at 
the company’s North American residential energy infrastructure operations. These assets are amortized on a straight-line 
basis over 10 to 20 years.
• Indefinite life intangible assets of $876 million (2019 – $667 million). The increase from 2019 is primarily attributable to 
the brand value at our North American rail infrastructure business.
• Access agreements of $1.8 billion with the users of the company’s Australian regulated terminal, which are 100% take-or-
pay contracts at a designated tariff rate based on the asset value, were included in intangible assets in 2019. The segment 
completed the sale of the investment during the year.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    184 
b)  Private Equity
The intangible assets in our Private Equity segment are primarily related to:
• Customer relationships of $5.1 billion (2019 – $5.3 billion), which remained consistent with prior year. The customer 
relationships acquired are assessed to have a useful life of up to 30 years.
• Water and sewage concession agreements, the majority of which are arrangements with municipal governments across 
Brazil, of $1.8 billion (2019 – $1.8 billion). The concession agreements provide the company the right to charge fees to 
users over the terms of the agreements in exchange for water treatment services, ongoing and regular maintenance work on 
water distribution assets and improvements to the water treatment and distribution systems. The concession agreements 
have expiration dates that range from 2037 to 2056 which is the basis for the company’s determination of the assets’ 
remaining useful life. Upon expiry of the agreements, the assets shall be returned to the government.
• Computer software, patents, trademarks and proprietary technology of $3.2 billion (2019 – $3.2 billion), which remained 
consistent with prior year. The proprietary technology has the potential to provide competitive advantages and product 
differentiation and is assessed to have a useful life of 15 years. 
c)  Real Estate
The intangible assets in our Real Estate segment are primarily attributable to indefinite life trademarks associated with the 
hospitality assets, Center Parcs U.K properties. The Center Parcs trademark assets have been determined to have an indefinite 
useful life as the company has the legal right to operate these trademarks exclusively in certain territories and in perpetuity. The 
business model of Center Parcs is not subject to technological obsolescence or commercial innovations in any material way.
Inputs Used to Determine Recoverable Amounts of Intangible Assets
We test finite life intangible assets for impairment when an impairment indicator is identified. Indefinite life intangible assets 
are tested for impairment annually. We use a discounted cash flow valuation to determine the recoverable amount and consider 
the following significant unobservable inputs as part of our valuation:

a)  Infrastructure
Goodwill in our Infrastructure segment increased primarily from the acquisition of a telecom tower operation in India 
completed in 2020, partial acquisition of interest in our Colombian natural gas transmission operation, as well as the impact 
from foreign currency translation.
In addition to goodwill from acquisitions completed in 2020, we have goodwill attributed to Genesee & Wyoming, Enercare, a 
Western Canadian natural gas gathering and processing operation, a Colombian natural gas transmission operation, a Brazilian 
regulated transmission operation, and a portfolio of North American data center operations. 
Goodwill attributable to our Brazilian regulated transmission operation arose from the inclusion of a deferred tax liability as the 
tax  bases  of  the  net  assets  acquired  were  lower  than  their  fair  values.  The  goodwill  is  recoverable  as  long  as 
the tax circumstances that gave rise to the goodwill do not change. To date, no such changes have occurred.
The valuation assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined using a discounted 
cash flow model. The key inputs are discount rates ranging from 11% – 14%, terminal capitalization multiples of  9x – 12x and 
cash flow periods from 7 – 21 years. The recoverable amounts for the years ended 2020 and 2019 were determined to be in 
excess of their carrying values. 
b)  Private Equity
Goodwill in our Private Equity segment remained consistent with prior year due to the impact of foreign currency translation 
offset by the dispositions incurred during the year. Goodwill is primarily attributable to Clarios, Healthscope and Altera. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the recoverable amount. The 
valuation assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for our construction services business are a discount rate of 
9.9% (2019 – 9.4%), terminal growth rate of 2.6% (2019 – 1.5%) and terminal year of 2025 (2019 – 2024) for cash flows 
included in the assumptions. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    186 
c)  Real Estate
Goodwill in our Real Estate segment is primarily attributable to Center Parcs U.K. and IFC Seoul. Their recoverable amounts 
for the years ended 2020 and 2019 were determined to be in excess of their carrying values. 
The valuation assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for Center Parcs were a discount rate of 9.5% (2019 –  
7.9%) based on a market-based-weighted-average cost of capital, and a long-term growth rate of 3.0% (2019 – 2.0%). 
The valuation assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for IFC Seoul were a discount rate of 7.2% (2019 –  
7.5%) based on a market-based-weighted-average cost of capital, and a long-term growth rate of 2.8% (2019 – 2.8%). 
d)  Renewable Power
Goodwill in our Renewable Power segment, which is primarily attributable to a hydroelectric portfolio, arose from the 
inclusion of a deferred tax liability as the tax bases of the net assets acquired were lower than their fair values. The goodwill is 
recoverable as long as the tax circumstances that gave rise to the goodwill do not change. To date, no such changes have 
occurred.
Inputs used to Determine Recoverable Amounts of Goodwill 
The recoverable amounts used in goodwill impairment testing are calculated using discounted cash flow models based on 
the following significant unobservable inputs:

The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognized as at December 31, 2020 is approximately $5 billion (2019 – approximately $5 billion).
The company regularly assesses the status of open tax examinations and its historical tax filing positions for the potential for 
adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes. The company believes that it has 
adequately provided for any tax adjustments that are more likely than not to occur as a result of ongoing tax examinations or 
historical filing positions.
The dividend payment on certain preferred shares of the company results in the payment of cash taxes in Canada and the 
company obtaining a deduction based on the amount of these taxes.

a)  Subsidiary Preferred Equity Units
In 2014, BPY issued $1.8 billion of exchangeable preferred equity units in three $600 million tranches redeemable in 2021, 
2024 and 2026, respectively. The preferred equity units are exchangeable into equity units of BPY at $25.70 per unit, at the 
option of the holder, at any time up to and including the maturity date. BPY may redeem the preferred equity units after 
specified periods if the BPY equity unit price exceeds predetermined amounts. At maturity, the preferred equity units that 
remain outstanding will be converted into BPY equity units at the lower of $25.70 or the then market price of a BPY equity 
unit. The preferred equity units represent a compound financial instrument comprised of the financial liability representing the 
company’s obligations to redeem the preferred equity units at maturity for a variable number of BPY units and an equity 
instrument representing the holder’s right to convert the preferred equity units to a fixed number of BPY units. The company is 
required under certain circumstances to purchase the preferred equity units at their redemption value in equal amounts in 2021 
and 2024 and may be required to purchase the 2026 tranche, as further described in Note 28(a).

b)  Limited-Life Funds and Redeemable Fund Units
Limited-life funds and redeemable fund units represent interests held in our consolidated funds by third-party investors that 
have been classified as a liability rather than as non-controlling interest, as holders of these interests can cause our funds to 
redeem their interest in the fund for cash equivalents at a specified time. As at December 31, 2020, we have $1.5 billion (2019 
– $1.9 billion) of subsidiary equity obligations arising from limited-life funds and redeemable fund units.
In our real estate business, limited-life fund obligations include $864 million (2019 – $921 million) of equity interests held by 
third-party investors in two consolidated funds that have been classified as a liability, instead of non-controlling interest, as 
holders of these interests can cause the funds to redeem their interests in the fund for cash equivalents at the fair value of the 
interest at a set date.
As at December 31, 2020, we have $517 million (2019 – $934 million) of subsidiary equity obligations arising from limited-
life fund units in our infrastructure business. These obligations are primarily composed of the portion of the equity interest held 
by third-party investors in our timberland and agriculture funds that are attributed to the value of the land held in the fund. The 
value of this equity interest has been classified as a liability, instead of non-controlling interest, as we are obligated to purchase 
the land from the third-party investors on maturity of the fund.
We also have $75 million of redeemable fund units (2019 – $41 million) in certain funds managed by our public securities 
business.

c)  Subsidiary Preferred Shares and Capital
Preferred shares are classified as liabilities if the holders of the preferred shares have the right, after a fixed date, to convert 
the shares into common equity of the issuer based on the market price of the common equity of the issuer at that time unless 
they are previously redeemed by the issuer. The dividends paid on these securities are recorded in interest expense. As at

redemption and conversion option dates have passed.
Subsidiary preferred capital includes $249 million at December 31, 2020 (2019 – $249 million) of preferred equity interests 
held by a third-party investor in Manufactured Housing which has been classified as a liability, rather than as non-controlling 
interest, due to the fact that the holders are only entitled to distributions equal to their capital balance plus 9% annual return 
payable in monthly distributions until maturity in December 2025. The preferred capital was issued to partially fund the 
acquisition of the Manufactured Housing portfolio during the first quarter of 2017.
Subsidiary preferred shares include $142 million at December 31, 2020 (2019 – $142 million) of preferred equity interests held 
by a third-party investor in Rouse Properties, L.P., which have been classified as a liability, rather than as non-controlling 
interests, due to the fact that the interests have no voting rights and are mandatorily redeemable on or after November 12, 2025 
for a set price per unit plus any accrued but unpaid distributions; distributions are capped and accrue regardless of available 
cash generated.

The company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Class A Limited Voting Shares ("Class A shares") and 
85,120 Class B Limited Voting Shares ("Class B shares"). The company’s Class A shares and Class B shares have no stated par 
value. The holders of Class A shares and Class B shares rank on par with each other with respect to the payment of dividends 
and the return of capital on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company or any other distribution of the assets of 
the company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs. Holders of the Class A shares are entitled to elect 
half of the Board of Directors of the company and holders of the Class B shares are entitled to elect the other half of the Board 
of Directors. With respect to the Class A and Class B shares, there are no dilutive factors, material or otherwise, that would 
result in different diluted earnings per share between the classes. This relationship holds true irrespective of the number of 
dilutive instruments issued in either one of the respective classes of Class A and Class B shares, as both classes of shares 
participate equally, on a pro rata basis, in the dividends, earnings and net assets of the company, whether taken before or after 
dilutive instruments, regardless of which class of shares is diluted.
On April 1, 2020, the company completed a three-for-two stock split of the company’s outstanding Class A shares. All share 
count and per share disclosure are presented on a post-split basis.
The holders of the company’s Class A shares and Class B shares received cash dividends during 2020 of $0.48 per share

Escrowed Stock Plan
The Escrowed Stock Plan (the “ES Plan”) provides executives with indirect ownership of Class A shares. Under the ES Plan, 
executives are granted common shares (the “ES Shares”) in one or more private companies that own Class A shares. The 
Class A shares are purchased on the open market with the purchase cost funded by the company. The ES shares generally vest 
over five years and must be held to the fifth anniversary of the grant date. At a date no more than ten years from the grant date, 
all outstanding ES shares will be exchanged for Class A shares issued by the company based on the market value of Class A 
shares at the time of the exchange. The number of Class A shares issued on exchange will be less than the Class A shares 
purchased under the ES Plan resulting in a net reduction in the number of Class A shares issued by the company.
During 2020, 3.8 million Class A shares were purchased in respect of ES shares granted to executives under the ES Plan 
(2019 – $16.0 million Class A shares) during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the total expense incurred with 
respect to the ES Plan totaled $35 million (2019 – $25 million).
The weighted-average fair value of escrowed shares granted for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $5.54 (2019 – $4.54), 
and was determined using the Black-Scholes model of valuation with inputs to the model as follows:

Restricted Stock Plan
The Restricted Stock Plan awards executives with Class A shares purchased on the open market (“Restricted Shares”). Under 
the Restricted Stock Plan, Restricted Shares awarded vest over a period of up to five years, except for Restricted Shares 
awarded in lieu of a cash bonus, which may vest immediately. Vested and unvested Restricted Shares are subject to a hold 
period of up to five years. Holders of Restricted Shares are entitled to vote Restricted Shares and to receive associated 
dividends. Employee compensation expense for the Restricted Stock Plan is charged against income over the vesting period.
During 2020, Brookfield granted 1.0 million Class A shares (2019 – 1.2 million) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Restricted Stock Plan, resulting in the recognition of $30 million (2019 – $25 million) of compensation expense. 
Cash-settled Share-based Awards
Deferred Share Unit Plan and Restricted Share Unit Plan
The Deferred Share Unit Plan and Restricted Share Unit Plan provide for the issuance of DSUs and RSUs, respectively. Under 
these plans, qualifying employees and directors receive varying percentages of their annual incentive bonus or directors’ fees in 
the form of DSUs and RSUs. The DSUs and RSUs vest over periods of up to five years, and DSUs accumulate additional 
DSUs at the same rate as dividends on common shares based on the market value of the common shares at the time of the 
dividend. Participants are not allowed to convert DSUs and RSUs into cash until retirement or cessation of employment. 
The value of the DSUs, when converted to cash, will be equivalent to the market value of the common shares at the time the 
conversion takes place. The value of the RSUs, when converted into cash, will be equivalent to the difference between 
the market price of equivalent number of common shares at the time the conversion takes place and the market price on the date 
the RSUs are granted. The company uses equity derivative contracts to offset its exposure to the change in share prices in 
respect of vested and unvested DSUs and RSUs. The fair value of the vested DSUs and RSUs as at December 31, 2020 was 
$1.3 billion (2019 – $1.4 billion).
Employee compensation expense for these plans is charged against income over the vesting period of the DSUs and RSUs. 
The amount payable by the company in respect of vested DSUs and RSUs changes as a result of dividends and share price 
movements. All of the amounts attributable to changes in the amounts payable by the company are recorded as employee 
compensation expense in the period of the change. For the year ended December 31, 2020, employee compensation expense 
totaled $5 million (2019 – $7 million), net of the impact of hedging arrangements.

Remaining Performance Obligation
Private Equity
In our construction services business, backlog is defined as revenue yet to be delivered (i.e. remaining performance obligations) 
on construction projects that have been secured via an executed contract, work order or letter of intent. As at December 31, 
2020 our backlog of construction projects was approximately $5.6 billion (2019 – $7.0 billion), with an overall weighted-
average remaining project life of approximately two years (2019 – two years).
In our Brazilian water and wastewater services business, our long-term, inflation-adjusted concession service contracts with 
various municipalities have an average remaining contract duration of 24 years as at December 31, 2020 (2019 – 24 years).
Others
In our asset management, infrastructure and renewable power businesses, revenue is generally recognized as invoiced for 
contracts recognized over a period of time as the amounts invoiced are commensurate with the value provided to the customers.
c)  Lease Income
Our leases in which the company is a lessor are primarily operating in nature. Total lease income from our assets leased out on 
operating leases totaled $6.7 billion (2019 - $6.8 billion) including $75 million (2019 - $67 million) of income related to 
variable lease income that is not dependent on an index or rate.

balance represents common equity and ETF positions established in connection with the company’s investment activities. 
The fair value of these instruments was reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements at year end.
e)  Commodity Instruments
The company has entered into energy derivative contracts primarily to hedge the sale of generated power. The company 
endeavors to link forward electricity sale derivatives to specific periods in which it expects to generate electricity for sale. All  
energy derivative contracts are recorded at an amount equal to fair value and are reflected in the company’s consolidated 
financial  statements.  The  company  has  financial  contracts  outstanding  on  121,468,000  MMBtu’s  (2019  –  78,364,000 
MMBtu’s) of natural gas as part of its electricity sale price risk mitigation strategy.

26. MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ARISING FROM HOLDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The company is exposed to the following risks as a result of holding financial instruments: market risk (i.e., interest rate risk, 
currency exchange risk and other price risk that impact the fair value of financial instruments), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The following is a description of these risks and how they are managed: 
a)  Market Risk 
Market risk is defined for these purposes as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the 
company will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk includes the risk of changes in interest rates, currency 
exchange rates and changes in market prices due to factors other than interest rates or currency exchange rates, such as changes 
in equity prices, commodity prices or credit spreads. 
The company manages market risk from foreign currency assets and liabilities and the impact of changes in currency exchange 
rates and interest rates by funding assets with financial liabilities in the same currency and with similar interest rate 
characteristics, and by holding financial contracts such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to minimize residual 
exposures. 
Financial instruments held by the company that are subject to market risk include other financial assets, borrowings and 
derivative instruments such as interest rate, currency, equity and commodity contracts. 
i.     Interest Rate Risk 
The observable impacts on the fair values and future cash flows of financial instruments that can be directly attributable to 
interest rate risk include changes in the net income from financial instruments whose cash flows are determined with reference 
to floating interest rates and changes in the value of financial instruments whose cash flows are fixed in nature. 
The company’s assets largely consist of long-duration interest-sensitive physical assets. Accordingly, the company’s financial 
liabilities consist primarily of long-term fixed-rate debt or floating-rate debt that has been swapped with interest rate 
derivatives. These financial liabilities are, with few exceptions, recorded at their amortized cost. The company also holds 
interest rate caps to limit its exposure to increases in interest rates on floating rate debt that has not been swapped, and 
holds interest rate contracts to lock in fixed rates on anticipated future debt issuances and as an economic hedge against the 
changes in value of long duration interest sensitive physical assets that have not been otherwise matched with fixed rate debt. 
The result of a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates on the company’s net floating rate financial assets and liabilities would 
have resulted in a corresponding decrease in net income before tax of $156 million (2019 – $246 million) on a current basis.
Changes in the value of fair value through profit or loss interest rate contracts are recorded in net income and changes in the 
value of contracts that are elected for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income. The impact of a 50 basis-
point parallel increase in the yield curve on the aforementioned financial instruments is estimated to result in a corresponding 
increase in net income before tax of $137 million (2019 – $146 million) and an increase in other comprehensive income of 
$363 million (2019 – $309 million), for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
ii.  Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Changes in currency rates will impact the carrying value of financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the 
U.S. dollar.
The company holds financial instruments with net unmatched exposures in several currencies, changes in the translated value 
of which are recorded in net income. The impact of a 1% increase in the U.S. dollar against these currencies would have 
resulted in a $117 million (2019 – $74 million) increase in the value of these positions on a combined basis. The impact on cash 
flows from financial instruments would be insignificant. The company holds financial instruments to limit its exposure to the 
impact of foreign currencies on its net investments in foreign operations whose functional and reporting currencies are other 
than the U.S. dollar. A 1% increase in the U.S. dollar would increase the value of these hedging instruments by $235 million 
(2019 – $259 million) as at December 31, 2020, which would be recorded in other comprehensive income and offset by 
changes in the U.S. dollar carrying value of the net investment being hedged.
iii.  Other Price Risk
Other price risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity prices or other market prices such as 
commodity prices and credit spreads. 
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    210 
Financial instruments held by the company that are exposed to equity price risk include equity securities and equity derivatives. 
A 5% decrease in the market price of equity securities and equity derivatives held by the company, excluding equity 
derivatives that  hedge compensation arrangements, would have decreased net income by $186 million (2019 – $14 million) 
and decreased other  comprehensive income by $161 million (2019 – $70 million), prior to taxes. The company’s liability in 
respect of equity compensation arrangements is subject to variability based on changes in the company’s underlying common 
share price. The company holds equity derivatives to hedge almost all of the variability. A 5% change in the common equity 
price of the company in respect of compensation agreements would increase the compensation liability and compensation 
expense by $69 million (2019 – $75 million). This increase would be offset by a $78 million (2019 – $80 million) change in 
value of the associated equity derivatives of which $69 million (2019 – $75 million) would offset the above-mentioned increase 
in compensation expense and the remaining $9 million (2019 – $5 million) would be recorded in net income.
The company sells power and generation capacity under long-term agreements and financial contracts to stabilize future 
revenues. Certain of the contracts are considered financial instruments and are recorded at fair value in the consolidated 
financial statements, with changes in value being recorded in either net income or other comprehensive income as applicable. A 
5% increase in energy prices would have decreased net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 by approximately 
$16.2 million (2019 – $5 million) and decreased other comprehensive income by $19.4 million (2019 – $nil), prior to taxes. 
The corresponding increase in the value of the revenue or capacity being contracted, however, is not recorded in net income 
until subsequent periods.
The company held credit default swap contracts with a total notional amount of $nil (2019 – $42 million) at December 31, 
2020. The company is exposed to changes in the credit spread of the contracts’ underlying reference assets. A 50 basis-point 
increase in the credit spread of the underlying reference assets would have increased net income by $nil (2019 – $1 million) for 
the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to taxes.
b)  Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of a borrower or counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations. The 
company’s exposure to credit risk in respect of financial instruments relates primarily to counterparty obligations regarding 
derivative contracts, loans receivable and credit investments such as bonds and preferred shares.
The company assesses the creditworthiness of each counterparty before entering into contracts with a view to ensuring that 
counterparties meet minimum credit quality requirements. Management evaluates and monitors counterparty credit risk for 
derivative  financial  instruments  and  endeavors  to  minimize  counterparty  credit  risk  through  diversification,  collateral 
arrangements, and other credit risk mitigation techniques. The credit risk of derivative financial instruments is generally limited 
to the positive fair value of the instruments, which, in general, tends to be a relatively small proportion of the notional value. 
Substantially all of the company’s derivative financial instruments involve either counterparties that are banks or other financial 
institutions in North America, the U.K. and Australia, or arrangements that have embedded credit risk mitigation features. The 
company does not expect to incur credit losses in respect of any of these counterparties. The maximum exposure in respect of 
loans receivable and credit investments is equal to the carrying value.
c)  Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company cannot meet a demand for cash or fund an obligation as it comes due. Liquidity risk 
also includes the risk of not being able to liquidate assets in a timely manner at a reasonable price. 
To help ensure the company is able to react to contingencies and investment opportunities quickly, the company maintains 
sources of liquidity at the corporate and subsidiary levels. The primary source of liquidity consists of cash and other financial 
assets, net of deposits and other associated liabilities, and undrawn committed credit facilities.
The company is subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the ability to refinance indebtedness at maturity. 
The company believes these risks are mitigated through the use of long-term debt secured by high quality assets, maintaining 
debt levels that are in management’s opinion relatively conservative, and by diversifying maturities over an extended period 
of time. The company also seeks to include in its agreements terms that protect the company from liquidity issues of 
counterparties that might otherwise impact the company’s liquidity.

28. OTHER INFORMATION
a)  Guarantees and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the company enters into contractual obligations which include commitments to provide 
bridge financing, letters of credit, guarantees and reinsurance obligations. As at December 31, 2020, the company had 
$4.1 billion (2019 – $4.1 billion) of such commitments outstanding. 
In addition, the company executes agreements that provide for indemnifications and guarantees to third parties in transactions 
or dealings such as business dispositions, business acquisitions, sales of assets, provision of services, securitization agreements 
and underwriting and agency agreements. The company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and certain of its officers 
and employees. The nature of substantially all of the indemnification undertakings prevents the company from making a 
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount the company could be required to pay third parties, as in most cases, the 
agreements do not specify a maximum amount, and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events, 
the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time. Neither the company nor its consolidated subsidiaries 
have made significant payments in the past nor do they expect at this time to make any significant payments under such 
indemnification agreements in the future.
The company periodically enters into joint ventures, consortium or other arrangements that have contingent liquidity rights in 
favor of the company or its counterparties. These include buy sell arrangements, registration rights and other customary 
arrangements that generally have embedded protective terms that mitigate the risk to us. The amount, timing and likelihood of 
any payments by the company under these arrangements is, in most cases, dependent on either further contingent events or 
circumstances applicable to the counterparty and therefore cannot be determined at this time.
The company is contingently liable with respect to litigation and claims that arise in the normal course of business. It is not 
reasonably possible that any of the ongoing litigation as at December 31, 2020 could result in a material settlement liability.
The company has insurance for damage and business interruption costs sustained as a result of an act of terrorism. The amount 
of coverage is reviewed on an individual basis and can range up to $4 billion. However, a terrorist act could have a material 
effect on the company’s assets to the extent damages exceed coverage.
The company, through its subsidiaries within the residential properties operations, is contingently liable for obligations of its 
associates in its land development joint ventures. In each case, all of the assets of the joint venture are available first for the 
purpose of satisfying these obligations, with the balance shared among the participants in accordance with predetermined joint 
venture arrangements.
The Corporation has entered into arrangements with respect to the $1.8 billion of exchangeable preferred equity units issued by 
BPY discussed in Note 19, which are redeemable in equal tranches of $600 million in 2021, 2024 and 2026, respectively. 
The preferred equity units are exchangeable into equity units of BPY at $25.70 per unit, at the option of the holder, at any time 
up to and including the maturity date. BPY may redeem the preferred equity units after specified periods if the BPY equity unit 
price exceeds predetermined amounts. At maturity, the preferred equity units will be converted into BPY equity units at the 
lower of $25.70 or the then market price of a BPY equity unit. In order to provide the purchaser with enhanced liquidity, 
the Corporation has agreed to purchase the preferred equity units for cash at the option of the holder, for the initial purchase 
price plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In order to decrease dilution risk to BPY, the Corporation has agreed with the holder 
and BPY that if the price of a BPY equity unit is less than 80% of the exchange price of $25.70 at the redemption date of the 
2021 and 2024 tranches, the Corporation will acquire the preferred equity units subject to redemption, at the redemption price, 
and to exchange these preferred equity units for preferred equity units with similar terms and conditions, including redemption 
date, as the 2026 tranche.
b)  Supplemental Cash Flow Information
During the year, the company capitalized $310 million (2019 – $233 million) of interest primarily to investment properties and 
residential inventory under development.
2020 ANNUAL REPORT    214 
29. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 4, 2021, the company announced that it had made a proposal to acquire 100% of the limited partnership units of 
BPY that it did not already own for a price of $16.50 per unit or $5.9 billion in total value. Subject to pro-ration, BPY 
unitholders would have the ability to elect to receive, per BPY unit, $16.50 in cash, 0.40 Brookfield Class A shares, or 0.66 of 
BPY preferred units with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit.
In February 2021, the company completed a secondary public offering of 15,000,000 class A exchangeable subordinate voting 
shares of BEPC at $51.50 per share. Upon the close of the offering, the company generated $750 million of cash proceeds.
