Dividend Policy 
The Company has set a policy of paying a dividend of 70% to 80% of the earnings before interest, depreciation, amortisation, impairment 
expense and tax (EBITDA). Dividends will by unfranked, however may have conduit foreign income credits attached. 
The payment of dividends will be subject to corporate, legal and regulatory considerations. 
The above policy allows the NGI Group to retain a portion of cash generated from operating activities, and to therefore have funds available 
to make additional investments into the Lighthouse Funds where such investments further the overall operating interests of the Group, or to 
act on external investment and/or acquisition opportunities as and when they may arise.

Annual Report 2018 | 2018 Highlights    5 
 
From the Chairman & CEO 
 
2018 has proven to be a transformative year for the Navigator Global Investments Limited 
  Group.   
In recent years we have made investments in our distribution team, our investment team 
A strong end to an 
and our information technology systems which has allowed us to continue to innovate and 
evolve.  This has paved the way for strong growth and performance in 2018, topped off 
exceptional year 
with a 48% increase in AUM from closing a transaction with Mesirow Financial.  This is the 
  most significant growth of AUM that we have seen in the Group’s history, and as at 1 July 
2018 the Group’s AUM stands at a record $16.72 billion. 
 
Change of name 
2018 saw us change our Company name to Navigator 
Global Investments Limited.  This name change was 
overwhelmingly supported by shareholders, and we believe 
has been well received by external stakeholders. 
We chose this name so that it resonated with our existing 
investment brand of Lighthouse Partners, and would have 
relevance and flexibility in the future as we grow. 
 
Acquisition of client assets from Mesirow Financial’s Multi-
Manager Hedge Fund Business 
In early March 2018, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of 
the client assets of Mesirow Advanced Strategies (‘MAS’) the multi-manager hedge fund 
division of Mesirow Financial.  We were very pleased that this transaction closed on 1 July 
2018 with the transition of $5.39 billion of assets under management to Lighthouse on that 
date. 
Aside from the purely financial benefits from such a substantial increase in assets under 
management, we believe the transaction will also provide other benefits.  The transitioned 
assets are largely in credit and other lending strategies, and include some less liquid 
strategies than our existing Lighthouse business. When combined with Lighthouse’s 
proprietary managed account platform, we believe this has the opportunity to create a 
unique offering which will benefit both our new and existing clients. 
The transaction structure is somewhat unusual, in that there is no agreed component to the purchase price, and instead is wholly deferred and 
contingent in nature.  The contingent consideration that may be paid in the future will be determined under an earnout payment over seven 
years, calculated as an agreed percentage of EBITDA generated by the transitioned assets.  The structure reflects both parties’ commitment to 
achieve the best outcomes for the transitioning clients, as well as our intentions to have a close relationship with Mesirow as a partner in the 
future. 
We’re also pleased to welcome many of the talented individuals from MAS, who bring with them an enormous amount of investment and client 
knowledge.  We are confident that they will mesh well with our Lighthouse culture. 
We see this transaction as an important milestone for the Group.  It creates further scale, expands our skill set and enhances our distribution 
opportunities. 
 
Growing global distribution 
We have continued to see additional opportunities present themselves in geographical areas such as Japan and the Middle East, and we are 
pleased to have delivered some key mandate wins from these regions over the year.  We also raised additional assets in North America and 
Europe, evidence that we have a well-rounded distribution team which is working successfully around the globe.  We maintain our focus on 
global distribution opportunities, and hope to gain access to even more market areas over the coming year. 
The MAS transaction also brings us a significant number of new client relationships.  We welcome the opportunity to work with so many new 
clients, and we look forward to ensuring that they continue to receive a high level of service and support, as well as also illustrating the full 
extent of our investment capabilities and services.

From the Chairman & CEO 
 
Investment performance 
After the markets had a relatively quiet first half of the year, the second half of the 2018 financial year brought change to the investment 
landscape. We see indications of frequent shifting of market sentiment as global expansion faced uncertainty in the form of trade tensions 
turning into tariffs, inflation starting to rear its head, and coordinated global growth beginning to diverge. At the same time, some trends persist 
as growth stocks continued to outperform value stocks with technology stocks leading the way, and small-capitalisation stocks dramatically 
outperformed their large-cap counterparts broadly.  How long these trends continue is open for question as we start to consume widely 
divergent fiscal and monetary policies globally. 
Long-term bond rates have fluctuated towards the end of this financial year as markets focused on the potential adverse impact that growing 
trade tensions may have on the path of future global growth. Two U.S. Federal Reserve rate increases and indications that two more may follow 
later this year have boosted the U.S. dollar and led to pressures on emerging markets. The European Central Bank has indicated that it will end 
its bond buying program, although at a later date than initially thought, while the Bank of Japan has kept its existing monetary policy in place.  
Consumer sentiment has varied considerably but weakened at the end of the year, which pushed U.S. gross domestic product projections down 
even as the June 2018 quarter came in at 4.1%. Nevertheless, U.S. economic growth and corporate profitability remain strong even as Europe 
and Asia show signs of slowing. In keeping with that contrast, U.S. equity markets were positive for the June 2018 quarter, driven by large-cap 
technology names, while many markets in Asia and across the emerging markets were down significantly. 
While predicting markets is extremely difficult, it is worthwhile to consider the range of possible outcomes from current levels. This year, the six-
month correlation of daily changes in the S&P and the 10-year Treasury yield, a formal measure of the strength of the relationship, is only 27%, 
which is half the level of a year ago. We think it is quite possible that, at some point, we will see a market where economic cycles, equity 
multiple compression, and the unwinding of global quantitative easing creates a scenario where both stocks and bonds actually lose money at 
the same time. Our multi-strategy funds, built to maintain low correlation to both equity and bond markets, may prove quite beneficial if the 
trusted diversification benefit between stocks and bonds breaks down. 
 
Strategic investments 
The Group holds investments in certain funds managed by Lighthouse.  These investments are made and held for a variety of reasons, 
including creating a more visible alignment of interests between Lighthouse and their clients, as well as providing seed money to commence a 
performance track record for new products.  Whilst we only added a modest $416,000 to these investments during this financial year, we expect 
to invest several more million into the Lighthouse funds over the next few years in order to support strategic goals and operating requirements. 
From time to time the Group also makes strategic investments in external entities.  These usually take the form of small stakes in start-up 
entities where we see innovation and knowledge which might help us further build our own skills, products or processes.  We monitor the 
progress of these entities closely, and while we see promise in the potential for success of these new businesses, we are aware that every new 
business faces challenges and uncertainties in the early stages.  We take this into consideration when assessing the value that these 
investments should be held at on the balance sheet. 
Unfortunately, not every decision can be a successful one.  During 2017 we took a 40% equity stake in a start-up investment manager 
specialising in the commodities space, and we provided funding for their operations over this time.  Whilst we continue to believe in the talent 
and skills of the principals, expected opportunities and mandates have not come to fruition, and hence the business model has not made 
sufficient progress for us to continue our support.  The business has spent the past several months rationalising operations, and we have 
recorded an impairment loss of $1.9 million for the 2018 financial year. 
 
FY18 operating performance 
The Operating and Financial Review on pages 10 to 16 sets out detailed information on the Group’s activities for the 2018 financial year.  We 
take this opportunity to highlight a few key points: 
Results from core operating activities 
The core investment management operating activities of the Group earned $33.6 million for the 2018 financial year, up 10% on 2017.  
Management and platform fee revenue growth came from Customised Solutions, as it is this part of the business which has achieved growth 
over the past year.  The Group also earned higher performance fee revenue this year, which is a result of a higher proportion of our AUM being 
able to earn performance fees than has been the case historically, coupled with positive investment performance in the relevant portfolios 
across the year. 
The first half trend of higher operating expenses continued in the second half of the year, and overall costs were higher by $9.6 million 
compared to 2017.  The largest component of this relates to staff costs, and reflects the fact that we have grown our staff numbers to 90 people 
as at 30 June 2018.  We have also continued to spend to make ongoing enhancements to investment processes and technology platforms 
across the business.  We see positive opportunities to continue to expand our client base. Fundamental to this is ensuring we have skilled staff 
who continue to deliver quality services to our clients, as well as encouraging ideas which lead to innovation and an evolution of our service 
offerings.

5 year historical performance 
The Board considers EBITDA to be the most relevant measure of the Company’s overall financial performance.  Given the nature of our 
operations, and taking into account timing differences arising from trade receivables and payables, EBTIDA is largely consistent with the cash 
flows generated by operating activities.  EBITDA for 2018 grew 15% on the prior year, and the Board is pleased that Navigator has also 
delivered a corresponding increase in the dividend paid to shareholders.  It has been very satisfying to see the Group achieve positive growth in 
both dividends and share price over the past five financial years: 
  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 
EBITDA (USD 000’s)  27,6241  28,8392  29,4901  29,848  34,212

Dividends 
The Directors have determined an unfranked dividend of 
9.0 cents per share (with 100% conduit foreign income 
credits) payable 31 August 2018.  Added to the interim  16.0
dividend of 7.0 cents per share, this brings the total for the  14.0

between rewarding shareholders and ensuring the Group 
can retains sufficient resources to take advantage of any 
 
growth opportunities which may arise. 
 
Outlook 
The MAS transaction is certainly a milestone transaction. Our goal is to see the transitioned assets integrate seamlessly into the existing 
Lighthouse business.   
In the future we will be reporting to shareholders and the market on the new combined AUM base and operations.  Whilst $5.39 billion is a 
substantial increase, we have been cautious in pointing out in our announcements about the transaction that we believe there is likely to be a 
somewhat heightened level of attrition of these transitioned assets in the short term.  This should be taken into consideration when assessing 
the longer term impact on revenue from the transitioned assets, as well as expectations for total Group AUM over the next one to two years. 
We operate in a competitive global industry, competing not only with our direct peers for client assets but against the asset management sector 
as a whole.  One of the key competitive pressures is on management fee rates, and we have felt the effects of this in our business this year.  
The Group’s overall average fee rate is likely to be impacted again next year with the change in proportional allocation of AUM between 
Commingled Funds and Customised Solutions from 1 July 2018 as a result of the MAS transaction, as well as from potential growth in Platform 
Service only client assets. 
 
Annual Report 2018 | From the Chairman & CEO    8 
 
From the Chairman & CEO 
 
At Lighthouse, we believe our managed account platform provides a better model for investing in hedge funds, and that our approach, 
infrastructure, and risk management system together provide us a structural advantage that is rare in the alternative asset management sector. 
This belief has allowed us to build truly differentiated alternative asset portfolios with exclusive exposures, and it spurs our evolution. 
We believe hedge funds, and more specifically portfolios focused on alpha-oriented managers with limited market and factor exposures, prove 
their worth across a range of potential market outcomes. Our focus is to improve the efficiency by which our portfolios seek their objectives by 
proactively finding the best mix of talent globally; improving access to research, data, and analysis; and reducing overall costs. We are focused 
on those objectives across the firm and believe our managed account platform and risk analytics provides an excellent toolkit to achieve them. 
 
We would like to extend the Board’s appreciation to all of our staff across the Group for their efforts in what has been a truly amazing year of 
achievement.  Every part of the business is fundamental in delivering quality investment management services for our clients, and for ensuring 
that Lighthouse maintains a reputation for quality and integrity in the marketplace.  We also consider ourselves fortunate to have employees 
who find it a rewarding to push for ways to evolve and grow our business.  One of our best assets is our organisational culture, and it is 
ultimately this which drives future benefits for both our clients and shareholders. 
We would also like to welcome all our new employees who come to us from MAS.  We are confident that they will be valuable additions to our 
team, and will be an integral part of future successes.

Performance fees 
Fees are a key consideration for investors, and there is pressure to 
reduce fees across the broader asset management industry.  We 
engage with clients and potential clients to ensure that fees are 
structured to provide an alignment of interests. 
We have created share classes in our Commingled Funds to 
provide more optionality for these investors to select a fee 
structure which best suits their requirements. 
Fee arrangements for Customised Solution clients are negotiated 
individually.  Whilst most arrangements involve only a 
management fee, some clients also have a performance fee 
component as part of their fee structure. 
Portfolios within both Commingled Funds and Customised 
Solutions which have the potential to earn a performance fee are 
approximately 12% of AUM as at 30 June 2018 (2017: 12%). This 
percentage can fluctuate within any given annual period. Due to 
improved investment performance in relevant portfolios, 
performance fee income for the 2018 year was $7.7m, up $6.1m or 
388% on the prior year.

must be made in estimating the contingent consideration, including   
but not limited to, the retention level of the assets over the full 
   
earnout period and the operating expenses required to support 
these assets. 
The Group is still in the process of assessing the fair values of the 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities in relation to the 
transaction.  As a result, as at the date of this report the Group is 
not in a position to determine and disclose: 
  the fair value of assets acquired as at acquisition date; 
  the amount of any goodwill or gain from a bargain 
purchase which may arise on the transaction; or 
  the revenue and profit or loss of the combined entity for 
the reporting period ending 30 June 2018 as though the 
acquisition had occurred as at 1 July 2017. 
As at 30 June 2018, approximately $1 million of acquisition costs 
has been incurred in relation to the transaction. 
Line of Credit arrangement 
On 27 July 2018 the Group entered into a $15 million line of credit 
arrangement.  The facility has been put in place to provide the 
Group with access to funding if considered necessary.  This 
arrangement is undrawn. 
There has not arisen in the interval between the end of the 
reporting period and the date of this report, any other item, 
transaction or event of a material nature, likely to affect 
significantly the operations of the Group, the results of those 
operations, or the state of affairs of the Group, in future financial 
years.

Overview of remuneration policy and  Operations are based in the United States 
structure 
NGI is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities 
Exchange, however its Group operations are predominantly based 
The overall objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies 
in the United States.  The Board is cognisant that remuneration

  support the business strategy of the Group by

  properly reflect each individual’s duties and 
These standards and benchmarks may diverge from arrangements 
responsibilities. 
which would be considered industry practice within Australia. 
  Embedding a culture that rewards performance whilst 
 
maintaining integrity, reputation and mitigating risk. 
 
The NGI Group’s approach to setting remuneration is influenced by 
the following key factors: 
Simplicity 
The Board believes that having a simple, direct metric for setting 
annual variable remuneration provides an incentive structure that is 
easily understandable to both staff and shareholders.  An increase 
in operating results and cash flows therefore correlates into both an 
increase in the available bonus pool for Lighthouse staff and a 
higher dividend payment for shareholders.   
This simplicity also translates into the Board and the CEO being 
able to exercise discretion in allocating bonuses to individuals 
based on their performance and contribution, and the overall 
performance of the Group.  Whilst individual results are important, 
we also encourage a culture which is able to reward effort and 
commitment. 
The Board believes the current arrangements are consistent with 
common industry practice in the United States, and allow the 
employees to focus on achieving results for clients, which is 
ultimately in the long-term interests of shareholders. 
Variable remuneration is the major component of 
remuneration 
The remuneration arrangements in place for Lighthouse are 
structured around setting a relatively low fixed remuneration 
amount, and having the opportunity to earn variable remuneration 
as a major component of overall remuneration.  The Board 
believes this provides a dynamic basis to be able to easily adjust 
the Group’s total remuneration expenses, and is also consistent 
with US industry practice. 
This approach to remuneration has been in place at Lighthouse 
since prior to its acquisition in January 2008.  The Lighthouse KMP 
have each earned a $250,000 base salary since that time, and this 
has not been increased in over 10 years.  In addition, select 
Lighthouse KMP have had bonus entitlements specified in their 
employment contracts since Lighthouse joined the NGI Group, and 
these contractual arrangements remain in place (see page 29 for 
additional details).

Remuneration structure   
The remuneration of staff across the Group, including our senior 
 
executives, is comprised of three elements: 
Base salary, as well as leave entitlements and employer 
 
contributions to superannuation and retirement plans. Lighthouse 
  employees are entitled to additional benefits that include 
educational assistance, adoption assistance and health care 
 
benefits.  
 
Fixed remuneration is determined by reference to benchmark 
  information where available, and having regard to responsibilities, 
  performance, qualifications and experience.  For senior Lighthouse 
employees, it is also determined in accordance with the general 
 
principle that fixed remuneration is the smaller component of their 
  overall compensation package. 
  Fixed remuneration is reviewed at least annually, or on promotion, 
Fixed remuneration to ensure that it is competitive and reasonable. There are no 
 
guaranteed increases to the fixed remuneration amount. 
 
The amount of fixed remuneration is not dependent on the 
  satisfaction of a performance condition, or the performance of the 
Group or business unit, the Company's share price, or dividends 
 
paid by the Company. 
 
 
 
The variable component of senior executives’ remuneration is 
  comprised of potential participation in a bonus pool and ability to 
  participate in equity incentive schemes when made available. 
  Variable remuneration The Board believes that short-term incentive arrangements should 
motivate senior executives and other staff to create wealth for both 
 
the Company's shareholders and our investment clients.  The 
  Group seeks to recognise the contributions and achievements of 
individuals towards these goals. 
 
Individual performance appraisals are conducted at least annually 
for all employees, including senior executives, as part of the annual 
remuneration review process. These performance appraisals assist 
the Board and CEO to make appropriate remuneration decisions, 
particularly in relation to short-term incentives.  The Board and CEO 
exercise their discretion when determining the amount of short-term 
Non monetary benefits incentive compensation awarded to an individual employee. 
 
Lighthouse employees are able to make investments into 
Lighthouse managed funds without incurring a management fee.  
There is no incremental cost incurred by the Group in providing fee-
free investment management services via the Lighthouse funds to 
employees.  Having employees invest their own assets into 
Lighthouse managed funds is viewed positively by clients and 
potential clients as it demonstrates an alignment of interest between 
the Lighthouse employee and future investment results for clients.  
Nil fee arrangements for employees is common practice in the 
United States asset management industry.

in macro-economic conditions. 
 
Long term incentive arrangements 
 
The Group does not currently have any equity incentive schemes or 
other long-term incentive arrangements in place. 
The Group’s senior executives hold significant shareholdings in the 
Company due to historical transactions and employee incentive 
plans.  As at 30 June 2018, the CEO owns 12.0% (30 June 2017: 
12.0%) of the Company’s shares on issue, and other Lighthouse 
executives also hold a meaningful number of shares (as disclosed 
on page 30).  
The Board acknowledges that an equity incentive scheme is a 
common component of corporate remuneration structures.  Due to 
the already significant level of senior executive shareholdings, the 
Board considers that there is a clear alignment of interest to 
incentivise them to deliver long term growth for the benefit of all 
shareholders.  The Board will continue to review equity incentive 
schemes going forward as a means to continue to align 
management and shareholders.

Fair value of financial instruments  
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the subjectivity of the inputs used in making the 
measurements.  The different levels of fair value hierarchy are: 
  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
  Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) 
  Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
Fair value measurements

of the transaction. 
The purchase consideration is a contingent consideration 
arrangement.  Under the agreement, there is no upfront 
consideration at acquisition date, other than reimbursement in 
cash of an immaterial amount for transferred prepaid operating

The transaction does not require an issue of equity by the 
Company or for the Company to obtain debt funding. 
The contingent consideration that may be paid in the future will be 
determined under an earnout payment over seven years, 
calculated as an agreed percentage of EBITDA generated by the 
transitioned assets above a floor amount.  Significant assumptions 
must be made in estimating the contingent consideration, including 
but not limited to, the retention level of the assets over the full 
earnout period and the operating expenses required to support 
these assets. 
The Group is still in the process of assessing the fair values of the 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities in relation to the 
transaction.  As a result, as at the date of this report the Group is 
not in a position to determine and disclose: 
  the fair value of assets acquired as at acquisition date; 
  the amount of any goodwill or gain from a bargain 
purchase which may arise on the transaction; or 
  the revenue and profit or loss of the combined entity for 
the reporting period ending 30 June 2018 as though the 
acquisition had occurred as at 1 July 2017. 
As at 30 June 2018, approximately $1 million of acquisition costs 
has been incurred in relation to the transaction.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Navigator Global 
Investments Limited 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Report 
Opinion 
We have audited the financial report of Navigator Global Investments Limited (the Company) and its 
subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 
2018, the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity 
and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies, and the directors' declaration. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations 
Act 2001, including: 
a)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 
2018 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and 
b)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001. 
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor 
independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the 
Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context. 
 
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit 
included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the 
procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying financial report.

Information Other than the Financial Report and Auditor’s Report Thereon
 
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report, but does not include the financial report 
and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report 
and our related assurance opinion. 
In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. 
As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
 
  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. 
  
  Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
to cease to continue as a going concern.  
 
  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the 
disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 
  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion. 
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit. 
 
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
