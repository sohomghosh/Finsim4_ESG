Our integrated corporate report 
combines financial and 
 sustainability reporting to inform 
shareholders, employees and the 
interested public about the 2018 
business year.
Chemistry for a sustainable future
Business success tomorrow means creating value for the environ-
ment, society and business. Our innovations contribute to a sustain-
able future. We support our customers in being more sustainable 
through our solutions and create new business opportunities that 
reinforce our customer relationships and attract new customers. In 
this way, we also contribute to achieving the U.N. Sustainable 
 Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted by the United 
Nations as globally recognized economic, environmental and social 
objectives.
On the cover:
Globally, BASF is conducting research on innovative cathode materials that 
make electromobility a reality. BASF’s innovations for high-performance 
lithium- ion batteries can help double the real range of a mid-size car from 
300 to 600 kilometers by 2025 and significantly reduce the charging time of 
electric vehicles. The photo shows a dry room at the research and 
development center in Ludwigshafen, Germany, where BASF is working on 
cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries and components for next- 
generation batteries such as solid-state batteries.
 For more information on battery materials, see page 33 and from page 74 onward

increase of 2% compared to the previous year. Our EBIT before special items d eclined 
to €6.4 billion, down by 17% compared with 2017. Cash flows from operating activi-
ties amounted to €7.9 billion, down 10% year on year, while free cash flow was €4.0 
billion, compared with €4.8 billion in the prior year. 
What are the reasons for this? Two-thirds of the earnings decline in 2018 can be  
attributed to the Chemicals segment. Prices for isocyanates fell sharply and cracker 
margins were lower than expected in all regions. In the second half of the year, low 
water levels on the Rhine River posed a particular challenge for us. At the Ludwigshafen 
site, at times we were unable to receive any deliveries of raw materials via inland  
waterways. Consequently, we were forced to reduce capacity utilization at our plants. 
This alone reduced our earnings by around €250 million.
Moreover, we noticed a significant cooling in our key markets, especially the auto-
motive industry, in the second half of the year. In addition, demand from our customers 
in China decreased considerably. The trade conflict between the United States and 
China was a factor in this slowdown.
Looking to the stock market, it is clear that the BASF share price was negatively  
impacted by the considerable year-on-year decline in earnings as well as the unfavor-
able macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. At the end of 2018, our share 
price was €60.40. Compared with the closing price at the end of the previous year, 
this represents a decrease of 34%.

has firstly been adjusted for special items. Secondly, amortization 
and valuation allowances (impairments and reversals of impairm  ents) 
on intangible assets were eliminated. Amortization of intangible 
 assets primarily results from the purchase price allocation following 
acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary nature. The effects of 
these adjustments on income taxes and on noncontrolling interests 
are also considered. This makes adjusted earnings per share a 
suitable measure for making comparisons over time and predicting 
future profitability. 
In 2018, adjusted earnings per share amounted to €5.87 compared 
with €6.44 in the previous year.

Net Assets
Investments accounted for using the equity method declined by 
€2,512 million to €2,203 million, largely due to the reclassification of 
oil and gas shareholdings to the disposal group. 
At €570 million, other financial assets were down €36 million from 
the prior-year level. Deferred tax assets increased by €224 million to 
€2,342 million, primarily from higher provisions for pensions and 
similar obligations. Other receivables and miscellaneous assets 
 declined by €446 million year on year to €886 million, mainly due to 
the reclassification of loan receivables to the disposal group for the 
oil and gas business.
Current assets rose by €12,076 million to €43,221 million. This was 
primarily attributable to reclassifications from noncurrent assets to 
the  disposal  groups.  The  assets  of  disposal  groups  totaled 
€14,607 million as of the year-end, of which €14,088 million was 
attributable to the discontinued oil and gas business.
Inventories increased by €1,863 million. Of this figure, €887 million 
resulted from the transaction with Bayer. By contrast, trade accounts 
receivable declined by €136 million and other receivables and mis-
cellaneous assets by €355 million, mainly due to lower bank accept-
ance drafts in China and the reclassification to the disposal group for 
the discontinued oil and gas business. Marketable securities rose by 
€292 million to €344 million following an optimization of current cash 
deposits. By contrast, cash and cash equivalents decreased by 
€4,195 million to €2,300 million, largely as a result of the purchase 
price payment to Bayer.

1 Amounts apply to an ordinary member of the Board of Executive Directors. The amount for the chairman of the Board of Executive Directors is 2 times this value, and 1.33 times this value for the vice chairman.
2 To reach the cap, a Board member must make the maximum individual investment based on the maximum performance bonus and the set limit on the gain from exercising the options granted must be reached.
The annual variable compensation in effect until the end of 2017 
was replaced as of 2018 with a forward-looking performance bonus 
that is geared to sustainable corporate development and has a 
three-year deferral component. The performance bonus is based on 
the performance of the Board of Executive Directors as a whole  
and the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the BASF Group. The 
target ROCE for the variable compensation is one percentage point 
above the cost of capital percentage for the financial year, which  
is determined using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)

the basis of the corporate strategy. They comprise targets for 
growth, portfolio optimization, investment and R&D strategy, digitali-

The achievement of operational and strategic targets is evaluated 
separately. The amount of the performance bonus thus takes into 
account the Board of Executive Directors’ performance for both the 
short-term and long-term success of the company.

Report of the  
The Supervisory Board addressed its tasks with a sense of responsibility. Its aim is to lay 
the best possible foundation for BASF’s continued successful and sustainable growth.
Supervisory Board
Monitoring and consultation in an ongoing dialog with the Board of  
Executive Directors
In 2018, the Supervisory Board of BASF SE exercised its duties as required by law and 
the Statutes with the utmost care. It regularly monitored the management of the Board 
of Executive Directors and provided advice on the company’s strategic development 
and important individual measures, about which the Supervisory Board was regularly 
and thoroughly informed by the Board of Executive Directors. This occurred both during 
and outside of the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the form of 
written and oral reports on, for example, all of the major financial key performance indi-
cators (KPIs) of the BASF Group and its segments, the economic situation in the main 
sales and procurement markets, and on deviations in business developments from 
original plans. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board tackled fundamental questions of 
corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales volumes and personnel plan-
ning, as well as measures for designing the future of research and development. The 
Supervisory Board discussed in detail the reports from the Board of Executive Directors, 
and also deliberated on prospects for the company and its individual business areas 
with the Board of Executive Directors. It was convinced of the lawfulness, expediency 
and propriety of the Board of Executive Director’s company leadership.

1 In general, only significant shareholdings are measured at fair value. All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost. Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings. Level 2 is applied to shareholdings for which 
valuation is based on parameters observable in the market to the greatest extent possible. These may be adjusted to reflect valuation-relevant characteristics of the respective shareholding in the fair value.
2 AC: amortized cost; FVTOCI: fair value through other comprehensive income; FVTPL: fair value through profit or loss; a more detailed description of the categories can be found in Note 1.2 from page 183 onward.
3 Fair value was determined based on quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.
4 Fair value was determined based on parameters for which directly or indirectly quoted prices on active markets were available.
5 Fair value was determined based on parameters for which there was no observable market data.
