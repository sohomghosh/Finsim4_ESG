Common Impact connects State Street 
employees to nonprofit organizations 
with proven models to tackle some of 
the challenges our communities face. 
This partnership has resulted in placing nearly 
400 State Street employees in skills-based 
volunteering projects that delivered solutions 
and support to 89 nonprofits. In 2020, 10 
grantees participated in long-term skills-
based volunteer projects while another five 
grantees performed a day of service, providing 
almost $150,000 social return on investment. 
Looking forward, we plan to expand our 
skills-based volunteer day of service to 
include additional organizations in the 
racial equity and social justice space.

Asset Management and Custody Activities
INTRODUCTION
State Street Corporation is a financial holding company organized 
in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We 
conduct our business primarily through State Street Bank, which 
operates as a specialized bank, referred to as a trust or custody bank, 
that services and manages assets on behalf of institutional clients.
We have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management.
Our Investment Servicing line of business performs core custody and related 
value-added functions, such as providing institutional investors with clearing, 
settlement, and payment services. Our financial services and products allow our 
large institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis 
in markets across the globe. As most institutional investors cannot economically 
or efficiently build their own technology and operational processes necessary 
to facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our role as a global trust 
and custody bank is generally to aid our clients to efficiently perform services 
associated with the clearing, settlement, and execution of securities transactions 
and related payments.
Our Investment Management line of business, through State Street Global 
Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and 
products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products 
span the risk/reward spectrum, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-
asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities, and 
alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to 
indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions,

(ESG) factors in investment and/or wealth management processes and strategies. TA
S
Driven by our 30+ years legacy in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
investing, State Street Global Advisors’ mission — to invest responsibly to enable 
economic prosperity and social progress — reflects our commitment to ESG 
principles. However, we do not take a one-size-fits-all approach to ESG investing. 
Our approach varies between investment teams to reflect the ESG integration 
philosophies of each team and the specific nuances of each investment strategy. 
As such, to achieve better risk-adjusted returns, our investment teams assess 
if and how financially material sustainability risks are integrated into their 
investment analysis and decision-making processes. This approach is detailed in 
our ESG Investment Policy Statement.
Specific approaches to ESG investing by investment area are summarized below.
Equity Index/Smart Beta
Within our equity index strategies, ESG can be integrated in multiple ways — 
either through the index itself (such as an index that either incorporates ESG 
characteristics or has sustainable investment as its objective) or as a custom 
solution via our beta solutions capabilities. 
Our indexing capabilities range from traditional market-cap-weighted index 
portfolios to smart beta and thematic ESG index portfolios. 
Active Quantitive Equity
The Active Quantitative Equity team believes that higher-quality companies, 
as measured by their scores on relevant ESG metrics, will deliver better 
risk-adjusted returns than lower-quality companies over the long term. The 
team has embedded ESG considerations into its investment process through 
the measurement of sustainability risks, through asset stewardship, and by 
integrating ESG metrics into the assessment of expected stock returns.

RE Active Fundamental: Equity — Growth/Core
T
E S Having long used ESG data to help isolate specific issues and assess the quality 
T

S
incorporate R-FactorTM and other ESG data metrics into their investment decision-
making processes. In some cases, they may still invest in companies where the 
team may have a positive view of company fundamentals despite a lack of data 
and/or poor ESG scores; as ESG disclosures by such companies improve and 
availability of data increases, the teams believe that scores will become more 
meaningful. 
Active Fundamental: Equity — Value
The team has long sought to identify and incorporate material ESG issues into 
their investment decision-making processes. Analysts will not typically exclude 
companies on the basis of a low or challenged ESG score. Instead, they seek to 
understand the underlying ESG issues and their potential impact on earnings 
power, balance sheet strength, and the value of the business. Their priority is 
long-term returns, and they seek to focus on the price paid versus the risk taken. 
Fixed Income
State Street Global Advisors manages both fixed-income index strategies, 
including those that seek to minimize costs and tracking error while adding value 
through a stratified sampling approach, as well as active strategies, which can 
be heavily reliant on credit research assessments. ESG factors play a particular 
role in helping to better assess “events” that can impact creditworthiness and 
valuation. In particular, corporate governance plays an overarching role in fixed-
income credit assessments. Governance structures drive risk policies and can 
safeguard proper checks and balances. The same investment considerations may 
also be applicable to environmental and social factors. 
Within our fixed-income indexing capabilities, sustainability risk can be integrated 
in a number of ways — similar to equity, this could be through the index itself 
(such as a third-party index) or by deploying screens, tilts, or stratified sampling 
techniques using ESG factors.

State Street Global Advisor’s Risk team increasingly considers sustainability 
credentials in its counterparty selection and oversight processes.
Cash
Cash management combines short duration and high-quality investments with the 
primary objectives of principal preservation and access to liquidity. Indeed, ESG 
factors are embedded and aligned with cash investment analyses and portfolio 
construction philosophies, which focus on risk mitigation, as well as balancing 
regulatory and rating requirements. The R-Factor score has been integrated into 
our Global Cash systems and investment process. Similar to issuer ratings, the 
R-Factor score is an input to the credit process but is not the driver of the overall 
investment decision. 
Currency
Currency hedging mandates are typically focused on removing the currency 
exposure in an underlying portfolio and so do not take a view on the long-term 
sustainability of the economies underlying the currencies. Where mandates 
allow State Street Global Advisors to take into account the longer-term growth 
potential of economies, we include a measure of the quality of different countries’ 
governance. 
Multiasset, Customized Solutions and Alternatives
Our Investment Solutions Group (ISG) is responsible for building multiasset and 
custom solutions to meet our clients’ specific investment objectives. State Street 
Global Advisors’ strategic asset allocation recommendations for our clients are 
dependent on the long-term assumptions we make about future risks and returns 
of portfolio components. In Q3 2020, we incorporated R-Factor into our long-term 
equity asset class forecasts. As some countries’ R-Factor scores are semi-
permanently higher than others (due to structural differences in culture, law, or 
environment), we focus on how R-Factor scores rise or fall over time, rather than 
on absolute levels.

Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures
Our approach to proxy voting and issuer engagement is premised on the belief 
that companies that adopt robust and progressive governance and sustainability 
practices are better positioned to generate long-term value and manage risk. 
As near-perpetual holders of the constituents of the world’s primary indices, 
the informed exercise of voting rights coupled with targeted and value-driven 
engagement is the most effective mechanism of creating value for our clients.
Therefore, we engage as long-term investors through our asset stewardship 
program on those issues that impact long-term value. Our focus in recent years 
has been on good governance and other practices that affect a company’s ability 
to generate positive returns for investors over the long run. Those issues span 
a variety of ESG topics material to sustainable performance. We approach these 
issues from the perspective of long-term investment value, not from a political or 
social agenda (aka “values”).

are able to leverage our global perspective when developing insights and to share 
best practices across sectors and geographies.
In our voting and engagement activities, we evaluate the range of factors that play 
into the corporate governance framework of a country, including macroeconomic 
conditions, the political environment, the quality of regulatory oversight, 
enforcement of shareholder rights, and the effectiveness of the judiciary. We 
complement our company-specific dialogue with targeted engagements with 
regulators and government agencies to address systemic industry concerns.
Our Asset Stewardship Team has developed an Issuer Engagement Protocol and a 
framework to increase the transparency of our engagement philosophy, approach 
and processes. This protocol is designed to communicate the objectives of our 
engagement activities and to facilitate a better understanding of our preferred 
terms of engagement with our investee companies. A copy of the protocol can be 
found on our website. 
The factors we consider in identifying target companies include:
• The size of absolute and relative holdings
• The top holdings of our commingled/pooled funds
• Systematic input from our active equity and fixed income investment teams
• Companies with poor long-term financial performance within their sector
• Companies identified as lagging market and industry standards on ESG matters
• Outstanding concerns from prior engagement
• Priority themes and sectors based on an assessment of emerging ESG risks

In September 2020, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre 
(AUSTRAC) issued an infringement notice to State Street for failing to report 
certain incoming international fund transfer instructions (IFTI) over a three-
month period from September to November 2019. State Street paid a penalty of 
$1,247,400 AUD (approximately $913,751 USD). The areas on which our remediation 
efforts have been focused are improvement in the governance framework and 
controls process design for IFTI reporting and improving the technological 
systems that support the IFTI reporting program to enable greater automation of 
IFTI reporting and reduction of manual review requirements. Initial remediation 
target dates have been met. State Street has also commissioned an independent 
consultant to conduct a follow-up review post-implementation to confirm that all 
remediation has been completed as planned and that State Street’s IFTI reporting 
program is in full compliance with relevant regulatory obligations. 
The follow-up review will encompass a review of the remediation in a live 
operating environment and is expected to be completed by mid-2021.

Description of whistleblower policies and procedures E S
T
A
T
S
We expect all employees to promptly report any actual, attempted, or suspected 
violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations, or policies. Failing to report a 
violation that one knows about is itself a violation. 
For managers, this means that when one is aware of an issue relating to an 
employee or contingent worker, they must address, escalate, and report the issue 
as necessary. This includes reporting situations outside of their department or 
involving employees or contingent workers outside of their team. 
There are many options for escalating concerns (see pages 53-54 of the State 
Street Standard of Conduct). For example, our Speak Up line is active 24/7 if 
there are concerns about known or suspected violations of laws or regulations, 
questionable business conduct, and breaches of the Standard of Conduct — such 
as breaches pertaining to accounting practices, internal accounting controls, or 
auditing. 
The Speak Up line is operated by an independent third party. An employee can 
report anonymously (except where local law does not permit), although identifying 
oneself allows State Street to act as quickly and appropriately as possible. 
State Street does not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a potential 
violation in good faith. Unlawful retaliation includes negative job consequences 
against any employee or contingent worker for acting upon a reasonable belief to:
• Report a potential violation of company policy or applicable law
• Participate in any internal or external investigation
To report an actual or possible violation of policy or law, an employee can contact:
• Their manager
• The Ethics Office (ethics@statestreet.com)
• Legal

SYSTEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT
FN-AC-550a.1
Percentage of open-end fund assets under management by category of liquidity 
classification
We are declining to respond to this disclosure.
At State Street, liquidity is managed at the fund level and the assets of one open-
end fund cannot be used to meet the redemptions of other funds, as each fund 
is separately managed and a separate legal entity. As a result, it is our opinion 
that aggregate liquidity classifications are not useful nor informative disclosures. 
In addition to this, as of 2018, the SEC no longer requires open-end mutual 
funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to publicly disclose 
aggregate liquidity classification information at the fund level as the data “may 
pose a significant risk of confusing and misleading investors.”
FN-AC-550a.2 
Description of approach to incorporation of liquidity risk management programs 
into portfolio strategy and redemption risk management
State Street’s approach to risk management involves all levels of management, 
from the board of directors and its committees, to each business unit and each 
employee. Responsibility for risk oversight is allocated so that risk/return 
decisions are made at an appropriate level and are subject to robust review 
and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee and is 
implemented through three lines of defense.

The business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their businesses,  E
R
T
are considered the first line of defense. Global Treasury is the first line of defense  E S
T
in, and responsible for management of, SSC’s liquidity. This includes the day-to- TA
S
day management of State Street’s global liquidity position; the development and 
monitoring of key liquidity risk metrics and early warning indicators; the creation 
and execution of stress tests; the evaluation and implementation of regulatory 
requirements; the maintenance and execution of liquidity guidelines and contingency 
funding plans; and reporting to management risk committees and the Board of 
Directors. As part of these responsibilities, Global Treasury calculates the liquidity 
coverage ratio (LCR), consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. For this 
purpose, Global Treasury implements a calculation process designed to include 
appropriate controls to promote accuracy and timeliness of the LCR calculation, 
including sourcing data via automated methods and attribution analysis to 
understand day-over-day variances and drivers. Global Treasury reports into the 
Corporate Treasurer.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and other support functions are considered 
the second line of defense. Global Treasury Risk Management (GTRM), part of 
ERM, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication, and 
management of Global Treasury’s risks in support of State Street’s business 
strategy. GTRM’s responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include 
the development and review of policies and guidelines; the development of risk 
appetite statement limits; and the monitoring of limits related to adherence to 
liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting. As part of these responsibilities, 
GTRM conducts a variety of activities relative to LCR, including: review of the 
liquidity risk management framework and regulations; development of internal 
limits for LCR above the regulatory minimum and internal escalation framework; 
and separate monitoring of the LCR results produced by Global Treasury. GTRM 
reports into the Chief Risk Officer.
Corporate Audit serves as the third line of defense and assesses the effectiveness of 
the first and second lines of defense. Corporate Audit reports into the General Auditor.

State Street also implements Liquidity Risk Management (LRM) oversight across 
all funds and client portfolios for which it serves as fund manager/investment 
advisor. The company monitors liquidity risk associated with a portfolio’s ability 
to meet potential cash outflows related to investor redemptions/withdrawals or 
potential liabilities related to derivative positions and secured funding trades, 
as well as changes in the liquidity of positions within the portfolio. The LRM 
framework focuses on a variety of risk models and metrics, quantitative tools, and 
qualitative methods. 
The ERM team runs regular fund level liquidity risk monitoring and reporting with 
the following key risk measures.
I. Asset Liquidity Risk: 
    a.  Estimated percentage of fund’s assets that could be liquidated in a 
      given time period (based on instrument level time to liquidate  
      assessment)
    b.  Estimated market impact (liquidation cost) when liquidating a given % of  
      fund’s assets (based on instrument level liquidation cost assessment)
II.  Funding Liquidity Risk (commingled funds):
    a.  Estimated % of fund that could be redeemed in a given time period (based  
      on historical redemption patterns and investor concentration)
III. Stress Testing Asset and Funding Liquidity Risk:
    a.  Historical scenarios: estimate relationships and sensitivities to past  
      events (e.g., 2008 Credit Crisis, 2014 Flash Crash, 2020 COVID-19 market  
      turmoil)
    b.  Hypothetical scenarios: measure potential impacts of market liquidity  
      shifts, stress redemptions based on investor concentration, and tail  
      redemption patterns

team sends out regular liquidity risk reports and discusses various aspects of 
liquidity risk with portfolio managers in risk review meetings. If a potential risk 
issue is identified, the ERM discusses the issue, and any potential mitigating 
actions, with the Portfolio Management Team, and escalates any liquidity issues to 
the Liquidity Committee.

this initiative is exploring options such as addressing zombie servers, reducing or 
limiting the energy required by servers, and replacing older servers with newer 
technology that reduces energy demands. We are also exploring options to provide 
energy to data centers that is renewable or non-polluting such as hydrogen fuel 
cell technologies. This provides State Street with not only low carbon electricity 
but also adds redundancy into the electrical system and often provides renewable 
energy credits, that will support our REC trading business.

Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security risks, 
including use of third-party cybersecurity standards
Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal 
and external, to, among other things, record and process a large volume of 
increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily 
basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. In recent years, 
several financial services firms have suffered successful cyberattacks launched 
both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to 
clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data, and reputational 
harm. We also have been subjected to cyberattacks, and although we have not, 
to our knowledge, suffered a material breach or suspension of our systems, 
it is possible that we could suffer such a breach or suspension in the future. 
Cyberthreats are sophisticated and continually evolving. We may not implement 
effective systems and other measures to effectively prevent or mitigate the full 
diversity of cyberthreats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as 
such threats evolve and advance.

We use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help 
us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement 
more effective controls, and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of 
our overall program to help us better align our cybersecurity program with what 
is required of a large financial services organization.
We have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a 
well-coordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks, recover from 
the attack, and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and 
external stakeholders.
The Technology and Operational Risk Committee (TORC) assesses and manages 
the effectiveness of our cyber-security program, which is overseen by the 
Technology and Operations Committee (TOPS) of our board. The TOPS receives 
regular cybersecurity updates throughout the year and is responsible for 
reviewing and approving the program on an annual basis.
TORC oversights include:
• The Operational Risk Committee, along with the support of regional business 
or entity-specific working groups and committees, which is responsible for 
oversight of our operational risk programs, including determining that the 
implementation of those programs is designed to identify, manage, and control 
operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across the firm.

TC-SI-330a.1
Percentage of employees that are (1) foreign nationals and (2) located offshore
Employees are key contributors to value creation in the Software and IT Services 
industry. While the number of job openings in the industry continues to grow, 
companies commonly find it difficult to recruit qualified employees to fill these 
positions. The shortage in technically skilled domestic employees has created 
intense competition to acquire highly skilled employees, contributing to higher 
employee turnover rates. 
To respond to talent shortages, companies often hire foreign nationals and 
offshore operations, creating employee management and sustainability challenges 
and related business risks.

Description of business continuity risks related to disruptions of operations
The core of State Street’s approach to business continuity lies in its commitment 
to redundancy, resiliency, and security and a robust program of stress-testing the 
systems we use. 
Our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business 
continuity, disaster recovery, or other operating, information or technology 
systems, facilities and activities may suffer disruptions or otherwise fail to 
operate properly or become disabled, overloaded, or damaged as a result of 
a number of factors, including, without limitation, events that are wholly or 
partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process 
transactions, provide services, or maintain systems availability, maintain 
compliance and internal controls, or otherwise appropriately conduct our 
business activities.

State Street uses many different platforms to meet its technology needs. 
Open systems (i.e. UNIX, Windows, Linux) make up the largest quantity of our

E INTRODUCTION
R
T
S
E 
T
TA We believe that climate change presents material risks and opportunities that 
S
companies should analyze, prioritize, and ultimately disclose. As the financial 
services industry, including banks, asset managers, and asset owners, continues 
to acknowledge and consider this fact, we are committed to providing additional 
transparency into our own activities regarding how we approach and manage 
issues related to climate change. 
Since 2017, State Street Corporation has supported the mission and objectives 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD was 
set up in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop voluntary and 
consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies to provide to 
their investors and other stakeholders. The TCFD reporting principles cover four 
main areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and reporting. 
This report provides an update on State Street’s progress across these four areas. 
Governance
In 2018, State Street’s board of directors took on responsibility for oversight of 
material ESG issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related 
risks. State Street’s overall corporate responsibility efforts are overseen by 
the Executive Corporate Responsibility Committee, which reports to the board 
of directors at least once per year. The Executive Corporate Responsibility 
Committee (ECRC) is charged with setting our corporate responsibility strategy, 
executing programs and initiatives and monitoring progress of the programs. The 
ECRC has been charged with supporting State Street’s responses to TCFD and 
the European Union’s Directive on Non-financial Reporting. The Global Corporate 
Responsibility Officer at State Street is accountable to the ECRC and provides 
operational leadership for the corporate responsibility activities under the 
committee’s purview.

From the investment side, State Street Global Advisors’ ESG investments team  E
R
T
also regularly reports on their activities, including risk assessments, stewardship  E S
T
efforts, and corporate engagements to State Street Global Advisors’ chief  TA
S
investment officer and chief executive officer as well as State Street’s board of 
directors. The Stewardship Team’s activities are directly overseen by the State 
Street Global Advisors Investment Committee (IC), which is responsible for 
approving our annual stewardship strategy, engagement priorities, and proxy 
voting guidelines in addition to monitoring the delivery of objectives. The Proxy 
Review Committee, a dedicated subcommittee of the IC, provides day-to-day 
oversight of the Stewardship Team, including approving departures from proxy 
voting guidelines and managing conflicts of interest. 
In addition to our own progress incorporating the TCFD principles, our asset 
stewardship team within State Street Global Advisors, State Street’s asset 
management business, engages regularly with their portfolio companies on how 
they are addressing climate change within the framework of the TCFD principles. 
This provides State Street Corporation with insights into best practices when it 
comes to TCFD implementation. 
Decisions regarding operational issues, new investments (outside of our asset 
stewardship activities, which we do on behalf of our clients) and real estate 
projects are always made with ESG — and thus climate — related risks and 
opportunities as important considerations. 
Strategy 
As part of our ongoing efforts to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, 
we engage key stakeholders across our organization to identify where our 
efforts are best focused, to return the most benefit to our internal and external 
stakeholders. 
This has resulted in our incorporating climate change into our business strategy in 
multiple areas:

R
T
E S invest in on our own balance sheet to avoid the negative impacts of 
T
TA climate change and to ensure we are prepared to invest our balance 
S
sheet in assets that align with our climate change goals. 
• Provide our asset management and custody clients with information that 
enables them to assess the climate change risks present in their portfolios 
and thereby enable them to fulfil their own TCFD goals or obligations.
• Protecting the long-term resiliency of our physical infrastructure — our business 
depends upon maintaining a robust and resilient physical infrastructure in 
our global locations that can handle the impacts of a changing climate.
• Manage our own impacts — In 2017, we publicly committed to 
science-based reduction targets for our carbon emissions. As of 
2020, we surpassed our 2025 target of 30% reductions. We have set 
a new goal of 27.5% reduction by 2030, against the 2019 baseline 
year. This is based on SBTI’s “well-below 2⁰ C” methodology. 
Impact on our Business, Strategy, and Financial Planning
We are a large-scale institutional investor in assets, or custodian of others assets, 
whose value may be affected by direct and indirect impacts from climate change 
and by the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe that exposure to these 
risks can have direct impacts on the ability of those assets to generate long-term 
value. This can impact our own financial performance in two ways – the return on 
investment from the assets we directly own may be impacted and the performance 
of assets that we hold in custody on behalf of our clients may be impacted by climate 
change. While our custodial clients ultimately bear the risks of climate change in their 
portfolios, we are committed to help them identify these risks and offer them asset 
management products and services that can reduce these risks.

Risk Management E

As a global financial institution that provides services to clients and  E S

counterparties across the world, climate change has the potential to impact  TA
S
us across many parts of our business, including through the value of the 
investments on our balance sheet, the locations in which we operate, and the 
financial condition of our clients. Based on our analysis, we believe that the risk of 
financial loss from climate change-related impacts to the assets on State Street’s 
balance sheet is currently limited, and is well-managed through our existing risk 
management framework.
Risk Identification 
Because risks evolve over time, risk identification is an ongoing process, which 
includes inputs across the first-, second- and third-line control functions, and also 
focuses on early detection of emerging risks, which are defined as exposures that 
are not necessarily newly identified, but whose manifestation and full implications 
are not entirely known. Outputs from internal processes, including the Material 
and Emerging Risk Identification Processes, are integral in developing risk 
management priorities and supporting stress testing.

State Street’s primary exposures to climate-related risks may manifest across its 
top risks, but can be grouped in three categories: First, there are physical risks 
to our own infrastructure, through the plant and property of our global footprint 
including our own carbon footprint and the impacts of climate risk on our physical 
assets. Second, we face financial risk due to potential climate-related impacts 
on the value of the investments on our own balance sheet. Lastly, we face some 
risks due to potential climate-related impacts on the long-term value of assets 
we manage or hold in custody on behalf of our clients, which may have significant 
repercussions for State Street’s business (Business risk). 
State Street also considers the strategic and reputational risks associated with 
climate change factors, including as they relate to exposure to carbon-intensive 
sectors or to clients or counterparties that may impact our credit profile, 
reputation, or strategic position (Business and Reputational risks).
Risk Assessment
All assets, physical or financial, have some level of inherent risk from the impacts 
of climate change. However, the risks of financial loss from those assets are 
driven by the residual risks that remain after asset-specific characteristics and 
structural protections are taken into account. 
Climate Change Risks to Our Physical Assets 
To stay abreast of any operational vulnerabilities related to environmental factors. 
we regularly evaluate the physical and financial risks of climate change in the 
context of our own activities. This includes assessing the frequency and severity 
of major weather events that may impact our operations, induce damage, disrupt 
our supply chain, or potentially hinder our ability to provide products or services.

operations. In addition. we implement appropriate infrastructure to safeguard 
against any business interruptions that could occur due to climate-related events. 
Some of the steps we have taken, or will consider taking to mitigate climate-
related risks to our infrastructure include:
• Locating critical infrastructure on higher floors of buildings
• Adapting business continuity plans to include 
scenarios of extreme weather incidents
• Innovative approaches to energy efficiency
• Flexible commuting options for employees
We also include the evaluation of climate-related event risks in our CCAR stress 
testing scenarios, where such events are incorporated as part of our evaluation of 
operational risk losses in our internally derived bank holding company scenario.  
We are currently assessing the potential of climate-related scenario analysis as a 
tool to inform our decision-making regarding our own operations.
Climate Change Risks to our Financial Assets
Climate risk-related impacts on financial assets are influenced by a number of key 
factors that provide protection against financial loss. These factors are assessed 
by State Street with regard to the assets on its balance sheet, and include:
With regard to the assets on our balance sheet, we have assessed our portfolios 
against their inherent and residual risk profiles at the asset class levels as shown

Factor Rationale
Asset Class Asset characteristics may increase or decrease inherent climate risk
Initial credit quality is a key determinant of an entity to withstand business fluctuations and 
similarly will provide the same level of ability to withstand impacts from climate change. 
Credit Quality
Conversely, a poorly rated entity may have limited ability to withstand the financial impacts of 
climate change
Many climate risk impacts compound over time. Major impacts are less likely in the near-term 
Tenor than in the medium- or longer-term. Therefore, shorter durations protect us from longer term 
risks and allow us to reposition as we continuously evaluate changing climate conditions
Climate risk impacts can vary broadly, resulting in winners and losers across and within 
Diversification
geographies and industries
Insurance Some assets are insured against some of the physical risks of climate change
Climate Risks by Country-Level Exposure
Based on country-specific risk assessments, the majority of the assets in our 
investment portfolio are in countries of risk that are deemed lower risk against 
key climate risk considerations, which include analysis of exposures against 
key factors such as natural disaster (event) risk, the management of natural 
resources, energy transition risks, and energy security risks. Similarly, direct 
exposure to sovereign entities is concentrated in countries also deemed lower risk 
against these key climate risk considerations.

Carbon Intensity 
For the publicly traded companies in our investment portfolio, we also monitor 
the carbon intensity of our portfolio relative to the index average for the S&P 
500. Overall, the State Street portfolio is slightly more carbon intensive than the 
index. Further analysis shows that, while within sectors, the portfolio is generally 
greener than the index, we overweight some sectors that have high carbon 
intensities due to other beneficial characteristics of those sectors for our risk 
profile. Carbon intensity is measured as tons of CO2 per million dollars of revenue.
We also conduct assessments of second order risks in our portfolio by assessing 
the preparedness of companies to whom we provide credit facilities through our 
Fund Finance business to manage their own climate-related risks.

Investment Risks Related to Climate Change
As long-term investors, State Street Global Advisors recognize that climate 
change presents material risk to a company’s ability to generate long-term value. 
As a result, Global Advisors’ stewardship team has been engaging with portfolio 
companies since 2014 on how they are addressing climate change risks and other 
sustainability issues. 
Since State Street adopted the TCFD principles in 2017, Global Advisors have 
used that framework to organize their stewardship discussions around climate 
change risk and opportunity and using their proxy vote to support climate-related 
shareholder proposals when they support the interests of long-term investors. 
Global Advisors’ have also been engaging with climate change data providers to 
better understand how they are calculating their climate risk metrics.
Engagement with Portfolio Companies
From the investment perspective, we recognize the value in assessing energy, 
greenhouse gas and other climate-related data for the companies in our 
portfolios. The objective is to better understand how the companies we invest 
in manage and work to mitigate climate-related risks, which in many cases may 
materially impact future financial performance. 
Further underscoring our commitment to climate-related issues, in 2020 we 
joined the Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative focusing on reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, largely by targeting some of the world’s largest 
GHG emitters.

We have identified the following long-term challenges and opportunities regarding  E
R
T
climate change.  E S
T
A
T
S
• Strong governance and cross-functional collaboration will 
be necessary to affect change in companies.
• Boards need to approach climate change as a systemic risk
• Boards need to improve their fluency on climate change regarding 
issues such as climate change risks, metrics, and reporting 
To help ensure State Street proactively manages ESG-related investment risks, 
State Street Global Advisors’ Asset Stewardship team uses a climate change risk 
oversight framework that helps us plan for any possible risks we may face due to 
climate change, encompassing all the equities we manage globally. 
We find that most companies are responding to the recommendations of the TCFD, 
which has become a widely accepted framework for companies to assess and 
report on climate risk. We view this as a positive development that will reduce 
climate risk in a significant portion of our portfolio. While progress is being made, 
we feel that it is not happening at a pace commensurate with the challenge. 
Therefore, we continue to encourage companies to disclose how they are 
addressing both climate risks and opportunities through engagement and voting 
on shareholder proposals. 
Our management of climate-related risks for client portfolios is multifaceted, 
including: 
• Climate-focused asset stewardship aimed at ensuring that boards and management 
teams are overseeing and managing their company’s exposure to climate risks. 
• Best-in-class climate data used to develop targeted investment solutions
• Investable solution offerings such as exclusionary screening,

TA • Climate-specific reporting designed to support clients in their understanding 
S
of how their strategies perform against climate-focused objectives. 
When we recognize risks or opportunities for improvement, we typically seek 
information from companies in the following areas: governance processes, 
greenhouse gas reduction goals, internal carbon pricing schemes, and scenario-
based assessments of risks and opportunities. 
In our experience, more accurate and timely information and deeper engagement 
on these topics will help us, the boards and management teams of the companies 
we invest in, and our clients assess climate-related risks more holistically and 
identify opportunities to maximize value creation. 
Since 2014, we have engaged with more than 600 companies across a range of 
industries and markets on climate-related issues. For more information, see  
State Street Global Advisors’ 2020 Annual Asset Stewardship Report.
Metrics and Targets
Transparency and disclosure regarding climate metrics is critical to achieve the 
objectives of the TCFD. We continue to actively work with the TCFD, other asset 
managers, climate data providers, and industry associations to achieve consensus 
on the climate metrics State Street itself and the companies we invest in use, 
according to their sector, how they calculate those metrics, and how they will 
report on those metrics. 
We also believe that further clarity regarding metrics, including warming scenarios 
and carbon pricing scenarios, will significantly accelerate the adoption and 
implementation of the TCFD principles and meaningfully increase transparency 
around the investment risks and opportunities climate change presents.

identify the areas of focus for the report. For the 2019 
materiality assessment, five external stakeholders were 
interviewed regarding their perspective on the materiality of 
each potentially material topic to State Street. These external 
stakeholders were from non-governmental organizations,

S
The State Street material topic “Risk Excellence and Compliance” includes the GRI topics “205 Anti-
Corruption,” “206 Anti-competitive Behavior,” “417 Marketing and Labeling” and “419 Socioeconomic Compliance.” 
It also covers our risk excellence programs.
Disclosure on Management Approach
103-1 Explanation of the Material Topic and Its Boundary
At State Street, our business depends on being a trusted partner. Risk excellence across all 
our operations is essential due to their potential impact on State Street’s reputation with our 
stakeholders and the risk to shareholders in the event of breaches. Ensuring legal and regulatory 
compliance, including anti-corruption, prevention of anti-competitive behavior, and honest and 
transparent marketing, is a top priority. We strive to foster a culture that allows us to identify and 
address potential issues before they become problematic from a compliance perspective. This 
also includes an open and ethical approach to the marketing of our products and services.
103-2 The Management Approach and Its Component
State Street is committed to conducting business in a fair and ethical manner. We manage all 
compliance and risk assessment programs primarily through the work of three management 
committees: the Management Risk and Capital Committee, the Business Conduct Risk Committee, 
and the Technology and Operational Risk Committee. The work of these three committees is 
overseen at the Board of Directors level by the Risk Committee and the Examining and Audit 
Committee. Together, this structure provides comprehensive oversight to the wide range of issues 
related to risk, compliance, and ethics. 
Since 2018, our compliance teams report to our Chief Risk Officer (CRO) rather than our Chief 
Administrative Officer (CAO), who oversees the first line of defense. This consolidated our 
second line under one reporting structure. Prior to this, our CAO oversaw the rationalization of 
compliance and business controls, which is why these functions reported into the same role. 
State Street employs a company-wide three lines of defense structure. The second line of defense 
is guided by the Compliance Risk Management Framework (CRMF). Please see [Risk Excellence 
and Compliance] for more information
Our Standard of Conduct sets forth our ethical priorities. The Standard of Conduct explains the 
core concepts of Ethics, includes a framework for Ethical Decision-Making, and guides employees’ 
decision-making process even when there is not a prescriptive rule for the situation at hand. 
Some of the principal Compliance policies that support our Standard of Conduct are:
• Standard of Conduct
• Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
• Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Procedures for Mergers
• Gifts and Entertainment Policy
• Political Contributions and Activities Policy
• Anti-Bribery Due Diligence on Vendors and Intermediaries
• Reporting on Concerns

E 
T policies to all employees. Ethics, First Line managers, Procurement, Finance & Accounting, 
A
ST Human Resources, Legal and Audit departments are all involved in the management of our 
Anti-Corruption policies. The policies mitigate regulatory and enforcement risk. They require our 
employees to neither offer nor receive anything of value in order to drive a particular outcome 
or benefit. In our procurement procedures, we apply due diligence to our business partners 
to ensure the partner is one we wish to do business with, from a compliance and reputational 
perspective as well as from a capability perspective. This means holding the business partners 
to appropriate standards. In addition, our policies require that employees and interns associated 
with State Street are hired based only on their merit, rather than any association.
Anti-Competitive Behavior
Fair competition is upheld by our policies and the law. Our Standard of Conduct prohibits misusing 
a client’s confidential information or engaging in any unfair dealing with competitors. Advance 
approval must be obtained by our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel before discussing 
pricing strategies with competitors, entering into agreements concerning market opportunities, or 
otherwise engaging in joint action. Competitive information and market data can only be obtained 
from public sources and through lawful means.
Marketing 
Regarding information on the products and services we offer, we have controls in place to 
ensure transparent, material, and consistent product and services disclaimers. We provide 
training within the Compliance team, and Compliance provides training to employees in various 
business roles to make sure appropriate disclaimers are made. Our Standard of Conduct 
prohibits all employees from misrepresenting any facts and requires employees to understand 
the permissible scope of cross-selling and bundling to ensure that products and services are not 
linked in a manner that would violate laws. 
Socioeconomic Compliance
All our business units are responsible for complying with rules and regulations and adhering to 
our ethical requirements.
103-3 Evaluation of the Management Approach
Our Chief Compliance Officer runs an annual compliance risk assessment to determine the 
amount and type of compliance monitoring that is required considering both the strength of our 
compliance internal controls and emerging trends. The evaluation of anti-bribery and corruption 
risk is conducted as part of this annual exercise and is reviewed throughout the year for material 
changes. Our management approach is highly adaptive. Adjustments are constantly made to meet 
emerging trends and needs.
Our “Speak Up/Listen Up” initiative encourages employees as well as business partners to report

Street paid a penalty of $1,247,400 AUD (approximately

governance framework and controls process design for 
IFTI reporting and improving the technological systems 
that support the IFTI reporting program to enable greater 
automation of IFTI reporting and reduction of manual 
review requirements. Initial remediation target dates

independent consultant to conduct a follow-up review 
post-implementation to confirm that all remediation has 
been completed as planned and that State Street’s IFTI 
reporting program is in full compliance with relevant 
regulatory obligations. The follow-up review will

Customer privacy is handled with extreme seriousness at State Street. We do not just hold 
custodial cash and securities, but also data. Our clients’ trust and confidence are the foundation of 
our relationship with them. They rely on us not only to enable them to make the best investment 
decisions, but also to safeguard sensitive information in our care. Keeping data safe is one of our 
core fiduciary responsibilities. Doing so is central to State Street’s reputation in the marketplace. 
This is important across the entire organization.

ensures awareness of client data protection and privacy programs at all levels of management. 
In 2020, we conducted a holistic offsite exercise with an industry leading vendor that simulated 
an actual cyberattack. Our most senior management committee members and senior executives

103-1 Explanation of the Material Topic and Its Boundary T
A
Across all parts of our organization, our diverse, hardworking, and talented employees drive our  ST
success. To be able to create long-term value, we have to ensure we are attracting and retaining 
the best and brightest employees. Our goal is to explain how our company offers opportunities 
that are more interesting and rewarding than positions in other industries and companies. We 
have a targeted approach for attracting interns, and various programs to develop talent internally, 
including our Professional Development Program and Leadership Development Program. 
We focus on specific labor practices that enhance the employee experience and performance. Our 
commitment to providing relevant learning for our employees around the world is a key offering. 
We do this through our newly created central learning organization called State Street Learning. 
Our Learning professionals located around the world create and implement solutions designed to 
meet the needs of our business and the development needs of our employees. 
103-2 The Management Approach and Its Component
At State Street, managers and leaders across the business are responsible for driving employee 
engagement. Our Global Human Resources team is responsible for employee engagement 
within State Street. This team continuously develops professional tools — strategic, conceptual, 
analytical, operational, and interpersonal — so our employees can exceed our clients’ 
expectations. In 2020, we administered status checks to continue gauging employee sentiment, 
allowing us to observe trends in the organization over time while helping leaders track the 
progression and impact of specific initiatives related to engagement in their business units.
Employment
Our focus is on attracting and developing a diverse workforce with the skills and expertise to 
serve our clients and communities. Part of our talent strategy includes offering a variety of 
benefits and flexible working options to meet employee needs, creating engaging employee 
experiences, and providing an inclusive environment. Talent Acquisition and Talent Development 
at State Street are globally managed functions with local executors; we are able to customize and 
tailor our general offerings as needed in each market. 
Training and Education
Through continuous development, we work to give our employees the professional tools — 
strategic, conceptual, analytical, operational, and interpersonal — they need. Career development 
at State Street is employee-driven, manager-enabled, and company-supported. State Street 
offers skills training programs that are developed and delivered by experts in each business 
area. Additionally, we offer professional development workshops and seminars that help 
employees enhance key skills such as communication and project management. We also provide 
a variety of management development programs. Our employees also enjoy the benefit of tuition 
reimbursement for job-related courses taken at accredited institutions.

ST We know that different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences spark creativity and create a

of talented future leaders across the whole organization. A diverse workforce helps us serve our 
clients better.
We recognize that equal remuneration for equal work across our company is material to our 
reputation and the motivation of our employees.
In addition, our flexible work program and global well-being resources create a healthier 
workforce, increase employee morale and enhance sustainable employee engagement.
103-2 The Management Approach and Its Component
Our inclusion and diversity strategy was developed and implemented by GHR’s Global Inclusion 
& Diversity team, with input of key champions and stakeholders, and approved by the company’s 
senior management. 2020 was the third year of our comprehensive five-year strategy that 
includes four key components: Communication, Accountability, Talent Pipeline, and Learning & 
Development. 
The Chief Diversity Officer role oversees the company’s global strategy and programs for diversity 
and inclusion. All business leaders participate in ensuring that our goals are met. 
The following policies cover diversity and equal opportunity:
• Equal Employment Opportunity Policy
• Diversity Policy
• Affirmative Action Policy
• Non-Discrimination & Non-Retaliation Policies
• Sexual Harassment Policy
Additionally, we have a dedicated department for employee relations and a whistleblower hotline 
available to all employees.
State Street continues to takes a strong stand in public policy initiatives focused on equality and 
inclusion such as marriage equality, safety for transgender people, and equal pay for women. 
As a component of our commitment to gender equity, State Street is making steps toward greater 
transparency for its pay structures. One of the steps of this work is our UK Gender Pay Gap 
Report, referenced within [Human and Social Capital: Pay Equity]. However, we do not globally 
report a woman’s basic salary as a percentage to a man’s because a simple across-the-board 
analysis of an organization of State Street’s size and multiple business-line complexity would not 
accurately compare similar positions or capture all elements of a total compensation program.

ST Our environmental impacts reflect our operational efficiency, and good performance helps attract 
and retain clients, save money, and engage employees. As a financial services company, our 
main impacts are indirect and related to the assets we manage and to issues of ESG integration 
into our client offerings (see [Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Products and Services 
Management Approach]). However, when compared to our operations, our products and services 
have minimal direct environmental impact. Hence, our focus lies in our emissions from operations 
and supply chain issues.
Energy and Emissions
We recognize the threat of climate change and are committed to reducing our fossil fuel 
consumption. Therefore, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission management and mitigation is a key 
aspect of environmental sustainability at State Street. Our energy usage in our buildings and data 
centers is responsible for most of our carbon emissions. Other emission sources are business 
travel and commuting.
103-2 The Management Approach and Its Component
In our Environmental Sustainability Committee, Global Realty, Procurement, Information 
Technology (IT), Travel, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) teams are all 
represented. This group manages GHG from operations, with Scope 1 and 2 predominantly arising 
from the Realty and IT functions, and indirect Scope 3 emissions arising from Procurement 
and Travel functions. ESG directly impacts investment emissions within our REC and carbon 
offset strategy. Our broader CR strategy is managed by the Executive CR committee. Our 
global Environmental Sustainability Policy states that we are “committed to being a leader in 
environmental sustainability, both in the way we carry out our operations and in the products and 
services we offer.” By conducting our business in this manner, we align our long-term success 
with the environment and create enduring benefits for our shareholders, clients, employees, 
and the communities in which we live and work. We consider adherence to this policy to be the 
responsibility of all individuals who take part in our activities.
Environmental Targets
As a financial services provider with mainly office-based operations, we are not subject to GHG 
emissions policies or regulations beyond what is typically required for other large companies 
in our markets. However, on a voluntary basis, we are committed to progress with respect to 
emissions. In 2016, the Science-Based Target Initiative officially approved our goal of a 30 percent 
reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions per square meter by 2025 from a 2015 base year. 
We are subject to Article 8 of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive, and the UK Carbon Reduction 
Commitment legislation for our operations in the UK and Europe. State Street follows GHG 
Protocol best practices and dual-report GHG emissions using both the location and market-based 
methods. For market-based figures, RECs are included. Purchased RECs are Green-e (NA) or 
EECS-GO (EMEA) certified. Per GHG Protocol guidance, carbon offsets are not included in market-
based method calculations

ST The range of products and services we offer directly affects our stakeholders and, in particular, 
our customers. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are increasingly used 
to capture intangible, off-balance sheet risks and opportunities. We recognize that firms that 
perform well on material ESG factors may be better positioned to generate sustainable long-term 
returns. As a result, we endeavor to offer our clients a range of products and services that draw 
on best-in-class data and analytics to bring ESG considerations into client portfolios. This is 
especially important for our Asset Management division, State Street Global Advisors. 
State Street Global Advisors currently has more than $464 billion in ESG assets under
management, or 12 percent of State Street’s assets under management. We systematically 
integrate ESG in the investment process for our actively managed strategies and offer a variety 
of ESG investment styles across asset classes: Exclusionary Screening, Best-in-class Investment 
Selection, Thematic, and ESG Integration.
Active Ownership
Our primary fiduciary obligation to our clients is to maximize the long-term returns of their 
investments. It is our view that material ESG issues can both create risk as well as generate 
long-term value in our portfolios. This philosophy provides the foundation for our value-based 
approach to asset stewardship.
103-2 Evaluation of the Management Approach
Product Portfolio
Ultimate responsibility for oversight of State Street Global Advisors’ ESG investing and asset 
stewardship efforts sits with our CEO, Global CIO, and the State Street Global Advisors Investment 
Committee (IC). Each asset class CIO oversees the implementation of ESG investment strategies 
by portfolio managers and research analysts. Nearly all of our global investment teams manage 
ESG portfolios and conduct ongoing research of ESG data and themes, with ESG portfolios being 
managed within each investment team rather than by a dedicated team. This reflects the breadth 
and depth of investment capabilities that we provide, and effective collaboration ensures that 
clients’ assets are managed by professionals with expertise in their asset class and investment 
style with support from subject matter experts. 
State Street Global Advisors’ ESG Investment Strategy and ESG Research teams, together 
with the Asset Stewardship team, lead our firm-wide effort to systemically identify the ESG 
risks and opportunities within State Street Global Advisors’ investment products. They work 
collaboratively with internal and external business partners and provide relevant insights to our 
global investment teams. Internally we focus on investing in innovative research ideas, richer 
information/data sets and focusing on the pricing of ESG factors across the asset classes to find 
new ways to meet our clients’ ESG investing goals.

State Street Global Advisors has an advanced level of engagement in many ESG-related 
organizations such as United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing (UNPRI), the 
Sustainability Account Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk & Sustainability Risk, the Carbon 
Tracker Initiative, and the Climate Bond Initiative. In addition, we play an active role in in the 
Council of Institutional Investors, and members of both the ESG Investment Strategy and Asset 
Stewardship team have contributed to the public dialogue on new and emerging ESG issues. 
Additionally, as an original member of the Corporate Governance Advisory Council, State Street 
Global Advisors has advised on the organization’s policies and priorities. As a global investor, 
we have been an active member of the International Corporate Governance network (ICGN), 
contributing to policy discussions and development. Our membership allows us to stay abreast 
of regulatory, policy, and other developments across the globe. As a signatory to the Japanese 
Stewardship Code, State Street Global Advisors has committed to being an active participant 
in the Japanese market and the advancement of corporate governance practices. We are also 
a founding member of the OnePlanet Initiative, an initiative founded by France’s president 
Emmanuel Macron to accelerate the integration of climate change issues into the management of 
large, long-term asset pools.
We have region-specific proxy voting and engagement guidelines that are disclosed on our 
website, and we are developing our ESG Policy based on our five core principles on ESG investing. 
Active Ownership
State Street Global Advisors’ approach toward proxy voting and issuer engagement is predicated 
on the belief that companies that adopt robust and progressive governance and sustainability 
practices should be better positioned to generate long-term value and manage risk. As near 
perpetual holders of the constituents of the world’s primary indices, the informed exercise 
of voting rights coupled with targeted and value-driven engagement is the most effective 
mechanism of creating value for our clients.

A
ST and harmonizing our voting decisions and engagement efforts, we leverage the full power of our 
institutional discretionary holdings and exert greater influence with management and boards. 
In conducting our voting and engagement activities, SSGA evaluates the various factors that play 
into the corporate governance framework of a country, including macroeconomic conditions, 
political environment and quality of regulatory oversight, enforcement of shareholder rights, and 
the effectiveness of the judiciary. SSGA complements its company-specific dialogue with targeted 
engagements with regulators and government agencies to address systemic market-wide 
concerns.
SSGA has a dedicated team of ESG analysts, based in Boston, Kraków, London, and Tokyo, 
who are charged with implementing its proxy voting guidelines and engagement activities on a 
global basis. The activities of the Stewardship team are directly overseen by SSGA’s Investment 
Committee. The IC is responsible for approving the annual stewardship strategy, engagement 
priorities, and proxy voting guidelines, and monitoring the delivery of objectives. Furthermore, 
the Proxy Review Committee, a dedicated subcommittee of the IC, provides day-to-day oversight 
of the Stewardship team, including approving departures from proxy voting guidelines and 
management of conflicts of interest.
The Stewardship team is supported by several specialists within SSGA in executing their 
stewardship responsibilities. These include members of SSGA’s proxy operations team who are 
responsible for managing fund set-up, vote execution, vote reconciliation, share recall and class 
action lawsuits, and members of SSGA’s client reporting and compliance teams.
103-3 Product Portfolio 
We regularly evaluate our ESG product portfolio management approach through Global
Investment Committee reviews and a Quarterly Business Review delivered to the Executive 
Management Group. In addition, we also use a formal employee evaluation process as part of the 
annual performance planning and review cycle, and client feedback for evaluation.
Active Ownership
SSGA conducts real-time and quarterly audits to review the accuracy of application of proxy 
voting guidelines to agenda items. In addition, SSGA’s Proxy Operations team conducts vote 
audits on firm-wide accounts to look for anything out of the ordinary. For example, more than the 
usual number of ballots rejected due to ballots received after vote cutoff. These cases are then 
investigated to understand the reason for ballot rejection.
Real-Time Audits:
During the first two calendar quarters (Q1 and Q2), the Asset Stewardship team performs a real-
time audit on a daily basis of voting decisions by SSGA’s proxy voting agent. Under this process, 
a company under review is identified as an audit company through a random process and is 
assigned to an analyst on the Asset Stewardship team. The analyst reviews the votes input by the 
proxy agent for each item on the ballot to ensure that SSGA’s voting guidelines are implemented 
accurately.

Material Topic: Board Governance
The State Street material topic “Board Governance” refers to our efforts to improve the diversity of the board of directors, their

the GRI Indicator “405-1 Diversity of Governance Bodies and Employees.”

103-1 Explanation of the Material Topic and Its Boundary
Governance, including structures, processes, and policies is material to State Street. As business 
conditions change, our highest level of decision-makers, the board of directors, must stay 
vigilant in monitoring and managing emerging risks. The board recognizes that for State Street 
to continue creating long-term value for its stakeholders, it must actively manage environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) factors. This encompasses the board’s oversight of sustainability, 
its diversity, and its effectiveness at deciding what is in the company’s best long-term interests. 
This topic is most material to State Street’s own operations but is also relevant to the company’s 
interactions with stakeholders of all types. 
103-2 The Management Approach and Its Component
As part of their duties outlined in the corporate governance guidelines, the board monitors 
State Street’s material activities and practices regarding environmental, social and governance 
matters. State Street also has a Nominating and Corporate Governance committee, which meets 
regularly and consists entirely of members who are independent under criteria established by the 
SEC and New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the chief investment officer periodically presents 
to the board on ESG matters in relation to State Street’s goals and the activities of the executive 
corporate responsibility committee.

Street recognizes the importance of diversity with regard to the composition of the board and 
strives to have a board that provides diversity of thought and a broad range of perspectives. 
In an effort to achieve these objectives, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
and the board consider a wide range of attributes when determining and assessing director 
nominees and new candidates, including personal and professional backgrounds, independence 
and tenure of board service, and other demographics such as gender identity, race and ethnicity, 
sexual orientation, and national origin. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is

TA As a leading global financial services institution, State Street became a signatory

to the United Nations Global Compact in December 2014. We have taken a leadership 
role in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as an early adopter. 
State Street is well positioned to drive significant progress on many SDGs and has 
identified five goals on which it has the greatest potential for impact. 
SDG4: Quality Education  
SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth 
State Street Foundation’s mission is to promote economic opportunity in the 
communities where we have a business presence. We invest in high-performing 
nonprofit organizations that support education, employability and employment 
opportunities for disadvantaged individuals, helping them gain the skills and 
educational qualifications needed to secure sustainable employment in today’s 
knowledge-based, global economy. 
State Street Foundation’s Impact Framework outlines a vision to contribute to 
the community health and well-being by promoting economic self-sufficiency 
among disadvantaged populations. Reaffirming our commitment to addressing 
socioeconomic and racial inequities in education — a long-standing focus of the 
Foundation — in 2020, we engaged a third party to assess the efficacy of our 
grant-making on communities of color and identify organizations that are doing 
meaningful work to address racial injustice. As we update our grant-making 
guidelines to explicitly include our racial equity and social justice goals, we will be 
positioned to build on our record of investing in communities of color.

GENDER DIVERSITY ON BOARDS  T
S
Through our Asset Stewardship team, we are using our voice and our vote to 
encourage portfolio companies to take ESG objectives seriously, including greater 
gender diversity on boards. State Street Global Advisors believes that board 
quality is foundational to good governance and positive investment outcomes. 
We have a responsibility as a fiduciary to engage on this issue and use our proxy 
voting power as stewards of our clients’ assets.
This focus on gender diversity came to life with our Fearless Girl campaign, where 
we informed hundreds of companies with no women on their boards that we were 
prepared to vote against the chair of their Nominating Committees if we didn’t 
see action. Since 2017, we have seen 862 companies out of the 1,486 we identified 
respond by adding a female director to their Board. In the US, 612 boards of 
directors added a female member, while 39 and 15 made this change in Canada 
and the UK, respectively. In Japan, 140 boards added a female director, and 44 
added a female director in Australia.
SHE IMPACTS 
As part of our dedication to furthering gender diversity, the SSGA Gender Diversity 
Index ETF (SHE), created in 2016, is an exchange-traded fund designed to measure 
the performance of US large capitalization companies that are “gender diverse,” 
exhibiting gender diversity in their senior leadership positions. 
SHE includes a charitable component — SHE Impacts, a donor-advised fund 
administered by National Philanthropic Trust, a 501(c)(3) public charity. SHE 
Impacts provides grants to organizations that prepare and encourage girls from 
kindergarten through grade 12 to take their place in STEM industries (science, 
technology, engineering, and math) where women have low representation today. 
SHE Impacts also supports programs that promote gender diverse leadership in 
the workplace.

To be a responsible corporate citizen, State Street continuously works to minimize

to reduce the environmental footprint of our business. Our commitment to 
environmental responsibility can be addressed in four main areas. 
As an asset servicing provider, helping clients better understand the carbon 
profile of their portfolio holdings so they can take action. 
As an asset manager, helping asset owners reduce climate risk in their portfolios 
and embrace the growth opportunities in green innovation, and engage with 
portfolio companies and boards to understand how they are managing the 
opportunities and risks of climate change.
As a responsible corporation, focused on the long term, continuing to reduce our 
carbon footprint by reducing energy use, greenhouse gases, and water usage and 
discharge, as well as improving waste recycling.
As an engaged industry and community partner, working with policymakers, 
industry initiatives like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, as 
well as local stakeholders like the One Waterfront project in Boston to maximize 
effort and impact on the problem of climate change.
OUR PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY 
We are proud to have achieved carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions (direct emissions as well as indirect emissions from electricity) in 2020 
through infrastructure retrofitting, purchasing renewable energy certificates 
(RECs) and carbon offsets, and by utilizing renewable energy sources wherever 
possible.

INVESTMENT CLIMATE ACTION
Investment activities related to climate are regularly reported to the State Street 
Global Advisors board as well as our CIO and CEO, including risk assessments, 
stewardship efforts, and corporate engagements. Our climate change risk 
oversight framework allows us to prepare and plan for potential climate-related 
risks that our business may be facing, including our globally managed equities.
State Street Global Advisors, one of the world’s largest asset managers, plays 
a key role in influencing the climate-related policies of the companies we invest 
in, which includes climate-centered asset stewardship that ensures boards 
and executives are implementing proper management and oversight of their 
company’s climate risk exposure; leveraging climate data to innovate investment 
solutions; investment-worthy solutions that include exclusionary screening, 
mitigation and adaptation; as well as climate-focused reporting that improves clients’ 
understanding of their strategy performance against climate goals and targets.

TA State Street is reissuing its 2018 EEO-1 report in this ESG Report, as the date for 
S
reporting on 2019 was postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
opening date to file both the 2019 and 2020 EEO-1 data collection was moved 
to April 2021, and therefore a complete EEO-1 report for those years will not be 
available until later this year. We will post those reports on our public website 
when they become available.

  the Report includes information required by the European Union Directive on Non-Financial Reporting, 
  as well as information for the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the United 
Nations Global Compact (UNGC). 
 
Our assurance activities   
We planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations that we believed were 
necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusions. A multi-disciplinary team of corporate responsibility 
and assurance specialists performed the following activities:   
  A review of external media reporting relating to State Street to identify relevant sustainability issues in 
the reporting period. 
  Attendance at regular teleconference meetings with the reporting team and report writers throughout the 
writing process to understand the development of the Report and issues raised during the process.  
  Virtual interviews with management representatives responsible for the sustainability strategy 
implementation.  
  Virtual interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and 
processes (including IT systems and internal review processes) used for collecting and reporting the 
2020 performance data and related disclosures for the topics covered in the Report. 
  A review of a sample of corporate level qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting the reported 
information. 
  For the 2020 data on GHG emissions, water usage and waste, virtual interviews with the external 
company responsible for collecting and consolidating utility data across State Street’s operations as well 
as a review of the completeness and accuracy of the data including unit and emission conversion 
factors for GHG emissions, the reasonableness of estimations and extrapolations and the accuracy of 
the data consolidation.  
  A check on whether the Report is in accordance with the GRI Standards (‘Core’ option) and includes 
relevant information for the European Union Directive on Non-Financial Reporting, TCFD and the 
UNGC.   
  A check of the consistency of the financial performance data disclosed in the Report with State Street’s 
2020 Form 10-K, where relevant. 
 
The limitations of our engagement 
Due to travel restrictions relating to COVID-19, our assurance activities consisted of desktop reviews of data 
and related information, and virtual meetings and interviews with State Street personnel responsible for the 
content of the Report. 
 
For the financial performance data disclosed in the Report, we have restricted our work to checking the 
consistency of those data with the audited State Street Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending 31 
December 2020. We have not assured the personal views expressed in the CEO Statement or the Letter 
included in the Report.  
 
While we have confirmed that the Report is ‘in accordance’ with the GRI Standards (‘Core’ option), we have not 
assured the additional information in the GRI Table in the Appendix.   
 
The reliability of the assured information is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for 
determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. It is important to understand our assurance 
conclusions in this context. 
 
Our observations  
We have provided State Street with a separate Management Report with our detailed (non-material) findings 
and recommendations. Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following key 
observation: 
  The Report includes disclosures based on a range of reporting frameworks and guidelines, including 
GRI, SASB and TCFD; each of these emphasizes a focus on issues and topics that are material. In 
addition to material topics, the Report also includes information regarding topics which have been 
assessed as not material but deemed important to State Street’s corporate culture. Structuring the 
Report to differentiate between disclosures relating to material topics and to other, non-material topics 
would enhance the relevance and accessibility of the Report for State Street’s stakeholders.
