Corporate Responsibility 2016 Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We continued to face a great deal of public scrutiny during the past year. In particular,
thenumerouslegaldisputesthathadalreadycostusbillionsofeurosunsettledinvestors,
employees, and clients.
Can a company in this situation still credibly report on its corporate responsibility? My
answer is an unequivocal yes. Now, more than at any other time, this is especially
important.Wemustandwewillshowthatwearedrawingtherightconclusionsfromour
past mistakes.
Since my term as Chairman of the Management Board began in the summer of 2015,
we have launched many initiatives to address our failings. We have simplified our struc-
tures, made many new management appointments, and resolved a number of our most
importantlegaldisputes.Towinbacktrustwealsoembracednewapproachesincommu-
nicating with our numerous stakeholders – our clients, shareholders and employees as
well as regulators.
The path we are taking towards becoming a better bank, as I described it at last year’s
Annual General Meeting, continues to be the right one for us. This includes accepting
ourcorporateresponsibilityandlivingaccordingtothevalueswewholeheartedlybelieve
in. We have demonstrated this clearly in several instances. When, for example, the US
state of North Carolina suspended the protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender (LGBT) communities in some cities in April 2016, we shelved our plans
to create new jobs in Cary. In doing so, our intention was to make absolutely clear our
commitmenttodiversity,toleranceandequality–oneofseveralreasonswhymanyofour
employees choose to work for Deutsche Bank.
At last year’s Annual General Meeting we also announced that we will not be expanding
our coal financing business, even if market opportunities present themselves. But we
wanttobeevenmoreambitiousandscalebackouractivitiesinthissectorbyupto20%
by 2020.
In addition, we want to provide transparency about how we manage the ecological and
social risks related to our activities. We published a policy framework on this issue in
May 2016 and are now using it as the basis for evaluating clients and transactions. We
havedeclinedseveralinitiallyappealingtransactionsbecauseoftheirassociatedenviron-
mental, social, and reputational risks, while we approved other transactions only subject
to certain conditions.
As the Management Board of Deutsche Bank, we are acutely aware that acting respon-
sibly is not just about one-off measures, projects, or initiatives. Our intention is to live up
to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact as the globally recognized
cornerstones of corporate responsibility across the entire bank.

Corporate Responsibility 2016 Ladies and Gentlemen,
We are creating new functions and structures to give a higher priority to sustainability
issues.WehaveappointedanewheadofourSustainabilityteamandarenowreinforcing
thefunction.Furthermore,ourDeutscheAssetManagementbusinessdivisionappointed
a chief strategist for responsible investments in December 2016. As a trustee for third-
party assets and one of the signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible
Investment (UNPRI), we aim to consider both financial and non-financial criteria when
making investment decisions. The new chief strategist will ensure precisely that.
Sowearedoingmuchthatisnewaswestrivetobecomeabetterbank.Weare,however,
alsokeepingsomethingsunchangedwherewearealreadywell-regarded.Weareoneof
the leading DAX-listed companies in terms of our social commitment. We contribute to
every society in which we have business operations. In 2016, we were able to reach 4.9
millionpeopleworldwidewithourcorporatecitizenshipprojects.We–andIpersonally–
are very proud of this.
All of this represents the better Deutsche Bank on which we have set our sights. I am
convincedthatwebestserveourclients,investors,employees,andsocietybyupholding
the immutable virtues and values of diligence, honesty, trust, and thoroughness. These
are the virtues with which all of us at Deutsche Bank would wish to be associated once
more.

Financial targets
»To reach our goals, we are now placing Deutsche Bank on three 
strong pillars […] At the same time, we need to control our costs 
even more tightly. Last year, we achieved a lot. However, in this 
tough environment, further reductions are unavoidable. We aim to 
reduce adjusted costs from 24.1 billion euros last year to around 
21 billion euros by 2021. Given our recent successes, I am all the 
more confident that we will reach these goals.«

Digitalization and data security
The dynamic landscape of technology(seepage42), along with changes in customer behavior and preferences, is
driving a trend of digitalization across the economy, with a marked impact on financial services. Digitalization
opens up opportunities for product, service, and business model innovations, as well as an enhanced customer
experience.Italsofacilitatesmoreefficientinternalprocessesinthatmoreactivitiescanbecarriedoutelectronically,
with banking transactions faster and more streamlined. With new emerging players such as FinTechs (financial
technology firms) challenging established financial institutions and their business models, it is evident that
successful digital transformation will be a key source of competitive advantage.

Our operating activities
In 2016, we organized ourbusinesses along four key client segments (see page0): Global Markets; Corporate &
Investment Banking; Private, Wealth & Commercial Clients; and Deutsche Asset Management. We provide
commercial and investment banking, retail banking, transaction banking, and asset and wealth management
products and services to corporations, governments, institutional investors such as insurers, pension funds and
foundations, small and medium-sized businesses, and private individuals.
Through our business activities, we help to circulate money, enable access to financial capital, deliver financial
security, and manage assets and risk. Our clients benefit from our services by realizing their own targets and
ambitions. We can only be successful if we meet and exceed the expectations of our clients. In doing so, we
generate income from our products and services, including net interest margins and fees.

Review and identification
To inform the choice of topics and global megatrends we present to our stakeholders to prioritize, we conduct
a thorough desk research. We applied a rigorous process supported by tools from the Sustainability Accounting
StandardsBoard(SASB)andtheGlobalReportingInitiative(GRI),whichwedisclosedinourCRReport2015.Weaim

the topics from our 2015 materiality assessment. The desk research included the screening of Annual General
Meeting(AGM)focustopics,sustainabilityratings,internalnews,mediaanalysis,andpeeranalysis.Theevaluation
showed that the previous assessment remained valid.
Prioritization and validation
The next stage is to present the topics, alongside the megatrends, to our stakeholders to corroborate our own
perceptionoftheoperatingenvironment(seepage8)thatshapedourbusinessduringtheyear.In2016,wedidthis
via a market research agency, which reached out to three groups:
Clients in Germany (business-facing and customer-facing)—a key stakeholder given Deutsche Bankclient-
centricity(see page38)
Sustainability professionals (working globally in companies, non-governmental organizations, and academia)
Deutsche Bank management-level employees globally (this was the first time we had targeted this group at this
scale)

a systematic approach to energy reduction in the US.
At an asset level, we continue to strive to reduce our energy and carbon footprint and further improve the ESG
performance of our assets. For example, we:
grew green label assets under management globally to €9.25billion;
achieved a goal of 3% in energy reduction across our US office portfolio6and

1Total emissions are based on actual, estimated, or extrapolated data. All assumptions and calculation methodologies are in line with the ISO14064 Standard
Guidelines with supporting documentation. The most appropriate emission factors have been used for each activity data type, from internationally recognized
sources, e.g. DEFRA (2015 and 2016), GHG Protocol, eGRID, and IEA (2015), RE-DISS (2015) or if more relevant, from country or contract specific sources. The
factors include all GHGs where possible and the gases' Global Warming Potential as per the IPCC assessments.
2Emissions from liquid fossil fuels decreased in 2016, largely driven by a reduction in diesel use in the Americas.
3Emissions from HFCs increased in 2016. The increase is in the expected range of the installed volume of cooling plants.
4Emission factors from IEA for electricity were used for the countries where DB operates (except for the US where the eGRID factors were used). The former set
of factors is only available in tonnes of CO2, while eGRID factors are specified in CO2e. However, as the proportion of non-CO2greenhouse gas emissions is
minute compared to CO2, we are reporting all emissions from electricity in CO2e.
5Air travel emissions continued to decrease due to an even stricter travel policy and increased demand for audio visual conferencing
6For 2016, carbon neutrality was accomplished by the purchase and retirement of verified emissions reduction units.
7Calculated electricity and heating intensities are used to estimate electricity and heating demand where data is not available. Calculated intensities from
refrigerant gas loss are also used to extrapolate where data is not available.
8Total energy consumption in gigawatt hours comprises all sources used in Scope1 and 2: natural gas, liquid fossil fuels (mobile and stationary), renewable and
grid electricity, district heating, cooling, and steam. Standard joule to kWh conversion factors were used. There is no sale of electricity, heating, cooling or
steam.
Energy consumption reductions achieved in offices total 7.0GWh from 114 initiatives (these saves are in-year, i.e. a save completed in June only gets 6 months
of saves towards 2016). In branches the reduction was 0.6GWh from 18 initiatives (these saves are annualised, i.e. a save completed in June counts for the
entire 12months of 2016). The types of energy included in the reductions are electricity, district cooling, district heat, natural gas. These totals exclude saves
made in the Postbank portfolio.
9Energy from primary fuel sources has decreased in 2016 due to a combination of decreases in natural gas use, owned/leased vehicles use and liquid fossil fuels
use.

1Waste data including the disposal method and hazardous /non-hazardous split has been determined by information provided by the waste contractor. Waste
data is extrapolated based on FTEs from Germany, the UK, the US and from eleven other countries, covering 72% of FTEs. Waste data does not include project
waste, e.g. from refurbishments.
2Waste composted in 2016 now includes data for Germany that previously was not possible to separate from recycled waste data. If this composted data for
Germany was included in recycled, the total recycled would have increased 4%. In addition, as composted waste is accounted for in the waste disposed total,
reported total waste disposed has increased accordingly.
3Waste incinerated (without energy recovery) has increased in 2016 largely driven by an increase in waste generation from Postbank sites.
4Waste landfilled decreased in 2016 as waste in Germany is no longer landfilled.
5Hazardous waste has decreased in 2016 driven by a reduction in hazardous WEEE waste from Germany.
6Copier paper data (“materials used” in GRI G4 reporting terminology) is extrapolated based on consumption per FTE from 17countries covering 89% of FTEs.
7A reduction in the number of printers, print pooling and behavioural change amongst staff has contributed to a reduction in paper use. A lower percentage of
paper purchased in 2016 was from recycled paper. We continue to purchase paper originating from sustainably managed forests.
