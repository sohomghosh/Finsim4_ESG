overlooking the park. The collaboration and efficiency already 
experienced by this investment has begun to catapult the bank to 
new heights. We have plenty of room to expand with bank growth, 
as the facility was designed to house 250 associates. Special thanks 
to Ashley Trout, SVP, Director of Distribution Strategies, for leading 
the design and build team, and delivering an enormous amount of 
value to the company. I encourage you to attend a function at the

4 PERFORMANCE & EXCELLENCE
Another Year of Achievement
2018 was a remarkable year of achievement for Heartland BancCorp, which is supported by exceptional financial performance results. Net income 
for 2018 increased 29% to $11.4 million or $6.68 per diluted share. This compares to earnings of $8.9 million or $5.40 per diluted share in 2017, 
which included additional tax expense of $541,000 or $0.29 per diluted share from a one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and liabilities as 
a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Return on average assets and equity were 1.16% and 13.15% respectively for 2018, compared to 1.05% and 
11.82% for 2017. Operating results were driven by double digit loan and deposit growth, net interest margin expansion, higher noninterest income 
and the lower, 18.1%, blended effective federal income tax rate in 2018. Growth of 16% in loan balances and 19% in demand deposit balances 
drove a $4.9 million, or 16% increase in net interest income. A favorable shift in earning asset mix, including higher loans-to-deposits, along with 
strong growth in noninterest DDA balances lead to an increase in net interest margin to 3.90% for 2018 compared to 3.87% in 2017. Loan loss 
provision expense increased by $405 thousand to $1.5 million, compared to $1.095 million in 2017 due to strong and consistent year-over-year 
loan growth. Noninterest income growth was fueled by an increase in loan sales and servicing revenue from agricultural loans and participation 
lending, up $391 thousand or 39% compared to 2017. Finally, Heartland’s efficiency ratio of 62.44% for 2018, reflects the company’s investment 
in talent acquisition and branch expansion to support continued solid and consistent growth. Heartland’s performance reflects the strength and 
commitment of our board of directors, and quality of the Heartland team.

2018 at a Glance
#BillionDollarBank  
Over the last several years, Heartland Bank 
has been growing at a robust rate and in 
the second quarter of 2018 reached the one 
billion dollar asset mark.  In the community 
banking world, this is a major milestone, and 
achieving this mark was a highlight to the 
midway point of another successful year. 
Heartland treated its associates to a Billion 
Dollar Bash to thank them for a job-well-
done with an evening of food, family and 
fun!
Best Bank
Heartland Bank was voted a 2018 CBUS 
Top Pick in the third annual Columbus 
Dispatch poll and topped the list of financial 
institutions in Central Ohio to be named 
Best Bank!  Nearly 250,000 votes were cast 
online this year and category winners were 
honored at the Winners Gala at St. Charles 
Preparatory School’s Walters Commons.
CEO Roadshow
Heartland’s CEO, Scott McComb, spent 
the summer visiting branches and 
rubbing elbows with the Heartland retail 
staff. He traded lunch for learning. The 
comradery, conversations and suggestions 
were exceptional. The takeaways from 
the encounters provided insight and 
understanding. The staff was appreciative, 
and more are planned for 2019. Direct 
communications and honest feedback 
resulted in a perfect way to end the summer!
Launch of ‘Driving the Cbus’ Podcast
Driving the Cbus is Heartland’s new 
podcast series featuring Scott McComb in a 
conversational, laid-back interview format as 
he probes the evolving and eclectic minds 
of several influential and interesting VIPs in 
the Central Ohio region. The podcast series 
was created to showcase different opinions 
about how and why Columbus became 
the great metropolis that it is and who the 
people are that helped make it happen.

12 A FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE
Home Sweet 
Home
Cramped quarters, inefficient associate 
arrangements, very little green space – great 
reasons to build new and a great way to 
start off 2018! Looking to the future became 
reality as the Heartland Bank Corporate Center 
was completed and occupied with thankful 
associates.
With an ideation space, fully-equipped gym, 
huddle areas and an array of conference rooms 
  Smiling faces of associates, board members, past board members and 
of all sizes, the HBCC was definitely something to  ▲

bottle with memorable label and a cookie decorated to commemorate the 
opening of the HBCC.
There were many learning curves: open work 
environments, updated technology and security 
badges. All have been embraced and melded 
into a new way of life. This new home for the 
Heartland family has become base camp for 
inspiration and imagination. 
  With flexibility of 
◀
meeting spaces in mind, 
the HBCC was designed 
to accommodate events 
of various sizes. One 
of the first events held 
in the new space was 
Breakfast with Business 
First. 
To hold any kind of large associate gathering, Heartland was tasked with 
searching for an event space twice a year for the All Employee Meetings. After 
completion of the HBCC, the event is held semi-annually in the Ideation/
Scarlet/Gray meeting rooms on the first floor where movable panels allow for 
room sizes to be altered as needed.
Looking back over 2018, the move into the HBCC ultimately takes center stage 
regarding quality of work life for the associates in the building and those 
visiting for training and meetings. It represents a foundation for the future, a 
place to drive success and a home for all those who are part of the Heartland 
family!
