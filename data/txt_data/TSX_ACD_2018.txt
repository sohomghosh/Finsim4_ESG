The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Company uses a number of other financial measures to monitor its performance and
believes that these measures may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financial position. These measures may not have standardized
meanings or computations as prescribed by IFRS that would ensure consistency between companies using these measures and are, therefore, considered to be non-IFRS 
measures. The non-IFRS measures presented in the Three Year Financial Highlight Summary, Letter to Our Shareholders, Management’s Roundtable Discussion and A Brief 
History of Accord are summarized on pages 10 and 11 of this Annual Report in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Such non-IFRS measures include adjusted net earnings,
