Relative Total Shareholder Return Aegon's position relative to 7 US and 7 non-US peers when looking at Total Shareholder Return for a 
1-year's performance period. These peers are selected for being the most similar to Aegon based on 
their index listing, industry classification, 5-year monthly Beta, Market Capitalization and Total 
Revenue1). The target was position 5, while the threshold was set at the median position. C
re
Return on Equity Return on equity indicates how good the company is in generating returns on the investment it  at
received from its shareholders. Aegon’s Return on Equity is calculated by dividing underlying earnings  ing
after tax and after cost of leverage by average shareholders' equity excluding revaluation reserve.  s
u
s
Fees and Premium based Revenues Fee and Premium Based Revenues represent the income from Aegon’s fee businesses as well as the  ta
fees charged and the actual premium collected less the benefit premium, expense loadings and profit  in
a
margins included in premiums for its life insurance and pensions business. b

Normalized Capital Generation   The movement in our capital position (on a Solvency II basis) during a retrospective 2-year period in the   va

e
returns) and one-time effects. Impacts from dividends and capital injections that do not generate 
capital but do affect Own Funds are excluded from capital generation.
Market Consistent Value of New Business Represents how much value the sale of new insurance policies is generating for the company. This 
value represents the present value of our best estimate of incoming premiums and outgoing claims, 
benefits and expenses related to these new sales.
Relational Net Promoter Score The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty metric based on the percentage of customers that 
would likely recommend our products and services to friends and family (scores 9 and 10) minus the  F

2.1.2 Voluntary change in accounting policy effective in 2020
A
Effective January 1, 2020, Aegon adopted a voluntary accounting policy change related to the deferred cost of reinsurance, which  t a
 g
is applied retrospectively for all periods presented.  la
n
  c
e
Reinsurance accounting  
As of January 1, 2020, Aegon has voluntarily changed its accounting policy for the deferred cost of reinsurance. A deferred cost 
of reinsurance is established when Aegon enters into a reinsurance transaction, except for reinsurance transactions that are entered 
into as part of a plan to exit a business. 
 
Under the previous accounting policy, the amortization of the deferred cost of reinsurance is based solely on assumptions 
relating to the underlying insurance contracts. Under the new accounting policy, for products sold in the Americas and Asia where 
the amortization is based on expected gross profit margins (EGPs), these EGPs are net of reinsurance (i.e., net of actual reinsurance 
cash flows that exceed expected reinsurance cash flows). Additionally, the reinsurance cash flows used to calculate the amortization  V
a
rate are unlocked prospectively. The accounting policy on the amortization of similar intangibles, such as deferred policy acquisition  lue
 c
costs, are updated accordingly.  re
a
  tio
n
The new policy was adopted because it better reflects the economics of Aegon’s reinsurance transactions and aligns to current market 
practice. The previous accounting policy would have resulted in significant income volatility in the event of incurred claims with large 
sums insured, despite the fact that a significant part of the losses is reinsured. 
 
Impact of the adjustment on previous periods is provided in the following tables, including references to the notes that are impacted 
by the change in accounting policy.

1  The amendments to IFRS 4, Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, issued in September 2016, allow entities that issue 
insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 to defer the implementation of IFRS 9 (and linked amendments ‘Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial instruments on 
prepayment features with negative compensation’). The amendments to IFRS 4 are further explained below.
C
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments rea
t
The IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, which was endorsed by the European Union  in
g
in November 2016. IFRS 9 combines classification and measurement, the expected credit loss impairment model and hedge   su
s
accounting. The standard replaces IAS 39 and all previous versions of IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9 Classification and Measurement, financial  ta
in
assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, based  ab
le
on both the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics.   v
a
The classification and measurement of financial liabilities is unchanged from existing requirements apart from own credit risk. For  lu
e
financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss, the changes which are attributable to the change in an 
entity’s own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income, unless doing so would enlarge or create an accounting mismatch. 
For the impairment component, the IASB included requirements for a credit loss allowance or provision which should be based 
on expected losses rather than incurred losses.
Application of IFRS 9 is required for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. However, on May 18, 2017, the IASB  F
in
published the final version of the IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts standard. Prior to its finalization, the IASB issued an amendment  an
c
to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (the predecessor standard to IFRS 17) that provides for a qualifying insurer a temporary exemption  ia
that permits, but does not require, the insurer to apply IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement rather than IFRS  l inf
o
9 for annual periods beginning before January 1, 2021 (i.e., a temporary exemption of IFRS 9). The objective of the amendment is to  rm
a
address the temporary accounting consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. This amendment was endorsed  tio
n
by the European Union in November 2017. 
On June 25, 2020, the IASB decided, next to a number of significant amendments to the Standard and subject to EU endorsement 
process, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As a consequence 
of the IFRS 17 deferral, the IASB also agreed to revise the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to allow 
O
entities to continue applying the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023. th
e
r n
o
An entity is eligible to apply the temporary exemption if the carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance activities is n
-
	Greater than 90% of the total carrying value of all liabilities; or fin
a
	Between 80% and 90% of the total carrying value of all its liabilities, and the insurer does not have significant activities unrelated  nc
ia
to insurance. l in
f
o
rm
Aegon performed this analysis at December 31, 2015, and concluded that it meets the requirements for the temporary exception  a
t
as 94% of its liabilities are connected with insurance activities. As a result, Aegon elected to make use of the temporary  ion
exemption of IFRS 9.
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
162 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  163
As Aegon defers the application of IFRS 9 (including linked amendments as included in above table), the full impact of the standard 
A A
t a in combination with IFRS 17 is not yet clear, however an initial impact assessment resulted in the expectation that it will have  t a
 g  g
la a significant impact on shareholders’ equity, income and/or other comprehensive income and disclosures. An implementation project  la
n n
c was started in 2017 and is combined with the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. c
e e
By qualifying for and electing the temporary exemption, the IFRS 4 amendment requires certain additional disclosures; specifically, 
Aegon is required to disclose information to enable users of financial statements to compare insurers applying the temporary 
exemption with entities applying IFRS 9. This information is presented below: 
Fair value changes 
The table below presents an overview of the fair value of the classes of financial assets as of December 31, 2020, as well as the 
change in fair value during the reporting period. The asset classes are divided into two categories:
V 	SPPI: assets of which cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on an outstanding principal amount,  V

tio IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts tio
n n
The IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017. The Standard will replace IFRS 4, which was intended as an interim 
solution and allowed insurers to continue to use accounting principles that they had applied prior to the initial adoption of IFRS. IFRS 
17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued, reinsurance 
contracts held and investment contracts with discretionary participating features issued. The objective of the Standard is to ensure 
that entities provide relevant information in a way that faithfully represents those contracts. This information should provide users 
O O
th of financial statements with a basis to assess the effects that the contracts have on the financial position, financial performance and  th
e e
r n cash flows of the insurer. The Standard also specifies presentation and disclosure requirements to enhance comparability between  r n
o o

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  166
The Standard represents a fundamental change to current financial reporting and the implementation effort is significant. Early 
A
adoption of the standard is therefore not expected. An implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new  t a
 g
Standard. Based on the final amendments of June 2020 quantitative assessments are performed and expected to continue during  la
n
2021. The outcome of these quantitative assessments will form the basis for final methodology and policy choices. The impact  c
e
of the initial application on Aegon’s financial statements is expected to be significant.
Interest rate benchmark reform
In 2019, Aegon elected to early adopt the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 1 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)’ 
issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the Phase 1 amendments have been adopted retrospectively 
to hedging relationships that existed on January 1, 2019 or were designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from 
applying specific hedge accounting requirements, thereby ensuring that uncertainty on the outcome of the Interest Rate Benchmark 
Reform (IBOR reform) does not result in early termination of hedge accounting, notably because the retrospective effectiveness may 
fall outside of the required range due to the IBOR reform. V
a
lu
e
 c
Please refer to note 24 Derivatives for the required disclosures of the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform for hedging relationships  re
a
for which the Group applied the reliefs. tio
n
In August 2020, the IASB issued the ‘Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 
4 and IFRS 16)’, which address issues that might affect financial reporting during the IBOR reform, including the effects of changes 
to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative 
benchmark rate. The Phase 2 amendments have no impact for the Group in 2020. Aegon continues to follow the developments of IBOR 
reform, and will assess the impact for the Group when further information becomes available.
C
2.2 Basis of consolidation rea
t
Subsidiaries in
g
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Aegon N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries (including   su
s
consolidated structured entities) are entities over which Aegon has control. Aegon controls an entity when Aegon is exposed, or has  ta
in
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over  ab
le
the entity. The assessment of control is based on the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity and, among   v
a
other things, considers existing and potential voting rights that are substantive. For a right to be substantive, the holder must have  lu
e
the practical ability to exercise that right.
The subsidiary’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on the acquisition date and are subsequently 
accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, which is consistent with IFRS-EU. Intra-group transactions, including 
Aegon N.V. shares held by subsidiaries, which are recognized as treasury shares in equity, are eliminated. Intra-group losses may 
indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests are initially stated  F
in
at their share in the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date and subsequently adjusted for the non-controlling share  an
c
in changes in the subsidiary’s equity. ia
l in
f
o
The excess of the consideration paid to acquire the interest and the fair value of any interest already owned, over the Group’s share  rm
a
in the net fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill. Negative goodwill is recognized  tio
n
directly in the income statement. If the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in the business combination 
has been determined provisionally, adjustments to these values resulting from the emergence of new evidence within 12 months 
after the acquisition date are made against goodwill. Aegon recognized contingent considerations either as provision or as financial 
liability depending on the characteristics. Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. 
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, 
O
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement. th
e
r n
o
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are stated at fair value when control is obtained. n
-
f
in
a
n
Subsidiaries are deconsolidated when control ceases to exist. Any difference between the net proceeds plus the fair value of any  c
ia
retained interest and the carrying amount of the subsidiary including non-controlling interests is recognized in the income statement.  l in
f
o
rm
Transactions with non-controlling interests a
t
Transactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners. Therefore disposals to non-controlling  ion
interests and acquisitions from non-controlling interests, not resulting in losing or gaining control of the subsidiary are recorded

n n
c Investment funds  c
e e
Investment funds managed by the Group in which the Group holds an interest are consolidated in the financial statements if the Group 
has power over that investment fund and it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. In assessing control, all interests held by the Group in the fund 
are considered, regardless of whether the financial risk related to the investment is borne by the Group or by the policyholders (unless 
a direct link between the policyholder and the fund can be assumed).
In determining whether Aegon has power over an investment fund all facts and circumstances are considered, including the following:
	Control structure of the asset manager (i.e. whether an Aegon subsidiary);
V 	The investment constraints posed by investment mandate; V
a a
lue 	Legal rights held by the policyholder to the separate assets in the investment vehicle (e.g. policyholders could have the voting rights  lue
 c  c
re related to these investments); re
atio 	The governance structure, such as an independent board of directors, representing the policyholders, which has substantive rights  atio
n n
(e.g. to elect or remove the asset manager); and
	Rights held by other parties (e.g. voting rights of policyholders that are substantive or not).
Exposure or rights to variability of returns can be the result of, for example:
	General account investment of Aegon;
	Aegon's investments held for policyholder; 
C 	Guarantees provided by Aegon on return of policyholders in specific investment vehicles;  C
rea 	Fees dependent on fund value (including, but not limited to, asset management fees); and  rea
t t
in 	Fees dependent on performance of the fund (including, but not limited to, performance fees). in
g g
 s  s
u u
s s
ta Investment funds where Aegon acts as an agent are not consolidated due to lack of control of the funds. In particular, for some  ta
in in
ab separate accounts, the independent board of directors has substantive rights and therefore Aegon does not have power over these  ab
le le
 v separate accounts but acts as an agent.  v
a a
lu lu
e e
For limited partnerships, the assessment takes into account Aegon’s legal position (i.e. limited partner or general partner) and any 
substantive removal rights held by other parties. Professional judgment is applied concerning the substantiveness of the removal rights 
and the magnitude of the exposure to variable returns, leading to the conclusion that Aegon controls some, but not all, of the limited 
partnerships in which it participates.
F Upon consolidation of an investment fund, a liability is recognized to the extent that the Group is legally obliged to buy back  F
in in
an participations held by third parties. The liability is presented in the consolidated financial statements as investment contracts for  an
c c
ia account of policyholders. Where no repurchase obligation exists, the participations held by third parties are presented as non- ia
l inf controlling interests in equity. The assets allocated to participations held by third parties or by the Group on behalf of policyholders are  l inf
o o
rm presented in the consolidated financial statements as investments for account of policyholders.  rm
a a
t t
io io
n n
Equity instruments issued by the Group that are held by investment funds are eliminated on consolidation. However, the elimination 
is reflected in equity and not in the measurement of the related financial liabilities towards policyholders or other third parties.
Structured entities
A structured entity is defined in IFRS 12 as “An entity that has been designed so that voting rights are not the dominant factor 
O O
th in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities  th
e e
r n are directed by means of contractual arrangements.” In these instances the tests and indicators to assess control provided by IFRS  r n
o o
n 10 have more focus on the purpose and design of the investee (with relation to the relevant activities that most significantly affect  n
- -
f f
in the structured entity) and the exposure to variable returns, which for structured entities lies in interests through e.g. derivatives, and  in
a a
n n
c will not be focused on entities that are controlled by voting rights. c

l in l in
f f
o Structured entities that are consolidated include certain mortgage backed securitization deals, where Aegon was involved in the design  o
rm rm
a of the structured entities and also has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the investee’s returns. Other factors that  a

Structured entities that are not consolidated include general account investments in non-affiliated structured entities that are used for  c

investment purposes.
Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups
Disposal groups are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only 
to the customary sales terms of such assets and disposal groups and their sale is considered highly probable. Management must 
be committed to the sale, which is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.
Upon classification as held for sale, the carrying amount of the disposal group (or group of assets) is compared to their fair value 
less cost to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is lower than the carrying value, this expected loss is recognized through a reduction  V
a
of the carrying value of any goodwill related to the disposal group or the carrying value of certain other non-current, non-financial  lue
 c
assets to the extent that the carrying value of those assets exceeds their fair value. Any excess of the expected loss over the reduction  re
a
of the carrying amount of these relevant assets is not recognized upon classification as held for sale, but is recognized as part  tio
n
of the result on disposal if and when a divestment transaction occurs.
Classification into or out of held for sale does not result in restating comparative amounts in the statement of financial position.
2.3 Foreign exchange translation
a. Translation of foreign currency transactions 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Items included in the financial statements of individual group  C
companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each  rea
t
entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. in
g
 s
u
s
At the reporting date, monetary assets and monetary liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency  ta
in
at the closing rate of exchange prevailing on that date, except for own equity instruments in foreign currencies which are  ab
le
translated using historical exchange rates. Non-monetary items carried at cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date   v
a
of the transaction, while assets carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. lu
e
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in the income statement when they arise, except when they are deferred 
in other comprehensive income as a result of a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge. Exchange differences on non-monetary 
items carried at fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income or the income statement, consistently with other gains and 
losses on these items.
F
in
b. Translation of foreign currency operations  an
c
On consolidation, the financial statements of group entities with a foreign functional currency are translated to euro, the currency  ia
in which the consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rates on the reporting  l inf
o
date. Income, expenses and capital transactions (such as dividends) are translated at average exchange rates or at the prevailing rates  rm
a
on the transaction date, if more appropriate. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are  tio
n
translated at the closing rates on the reporting date.
The resulting exchange differences are recognized in the 'foreign currency translation reserve', which is part of shareholders’ 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity the related cumulative exchange differences included in the reserve are recognized 
in the income statement.

2.5 Offsetting of assets and liabilities c
ia
Financial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right  l in
f
to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis or simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must  o
rm
not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency  a
t
or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterpart. ion

2.6 Intangible assets
A A
t a a. Goodwill t a
 g  g
la Goodwill is recognized as an intangible asset for interests in subsidiaries and is measured as the positive difference between  la
n n
c the acquisition cost and the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.  c
e e
Subsequently, goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges. It is derecognized when the interest in the subsidiary 
is disposed.
b. Value of business acquired 
When a portfolio of insurance contracts is acquired, whether directly from another insurance company or as part of a business 
combination, the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities is recognized as value 
of business acquired (VOBA). The Group also recognizes VOBA when it acquires a portfolio of investment contracts with discretionary 
participation features. 
V V
a a
lue VOBA is amortized over the useful life of the acquired contracts, based on either the expected future premiums, revenues  lue
 c  c
re or the expected gross profit margins. The amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date; any change in estimates  re
a a
tio is recorded in the income statement. For all products, VOBA, in conjunction with deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where  tio
n n
appropriate, is assessed for recoverability using aggregation levels on a geographical jurisdiction basis or at the level of portfolio 
of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a single portfolio. The portion determined not to be 
recoverable is charged to the income statement. VOBA is considered in the liability adequacy test for each reporting period, for more 
details refer to 2.19.f Liability adequacy testing. 
When unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing the insurance liabilities, VOBA is adjusted to equal the effect 
C that the realization of the gains or losses (through a sale or impairment) would have had on VOBA. The adjustment is recognized  C
rea in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders’ equity. VOBA is derecognized when  rea
t t
in the related contracts are settled or disposed.  in

u u
s s
ta c. Future servicing rights ta
in in
ab On the acquisition of a portfolio of investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render  ab
le le
 v investment management services, the present value of future servicing rights is recognized as an intangible asset. Future servicing   v
a a
lu rights can also be recognized on the sale of a loan portfolio or the acquisition of insurance agency activities. lu
e e
The present value of the future servicing rights is amortized over the servicing period and is subject to impairment testing. It is 
derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.
Where applicable, Aegon recognizes other intangibles on the acquisition of a business combination such as those related to customer 
F relationships. This can include customer contracts, distribution agreements and client portfolios. For these intangibles the present  F
in in
an value of future cash flows are recognized and amortized in the period when future economic benefits arise from these intangibles.  an
c c
ia These intangible assets are also presented under future servicing rights. ia

o o
rm d. Software and other intangible assets rm
a a
tio Software and other intangible assets are recognized to the extent that the assets can be identified, are controlled by the Group,  tio

are expected to provide future economic benefits and can be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize internally generated 
intangible assets arising from research or internally generated goodwill, brands, customer lists and similar items.
Software and other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation 
of the asset is over its useful life as the future economic benefits emerge and is recognized in the income statement as an expense.

2.7 Investments
A
General account investments comprise financial assets, excluding derivatives, as well as investments in real estate. t a
 g
la
n
a. Financial assets, excluding derivatives c
e
Financial assets are recognized at trade date (except for Private placements that are recognized at settlement date) when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. All financial assets are classified for accounting purposes depending 
on the characteristics of the instruments and the purpose for which they were purchased.
Classification
The following financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss: financial assets held for trading, financial assets 
managed on a fair value basis in accordance with the Group’s investment strategy and financial assets containing an embedded 
derivative that is not closely related and that cannot be reliably bifurcated. In addition, in certain instances the Group designates 
financial assets to this category when by doing so a potential accounting mismatch in the financial statements is eliminated  V
a
or significantly reduced. lue
 c
re
a
Financial assets with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend  tio
n
to sell in the near future are classified as loans. Those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, 
other than because of credit deterioration, are accounted for as available-for-sale.
All remaining non-derivative financial assets are classified as available-for-sale. 
Measurement
Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, any  C
directly attributable incremental transaction costs. rea
t
in
g
Loans and financial assets held-to-maturity are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.   su
s
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognized in the income  ta
in
statement as incurred. Available-for-sale assets are recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value recognized in other  ab
le
comprehensive income. Financial assets that are designated as hedged items are measured in accordance with the requirements for   v
a
hedge accounting. lu
e
Amortized cost
The amortized cost of a debt instrument is the amount at which it is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus 
or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction 
for impairment. The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortized cost and of allocating the interest income 
or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments  F
in
or receipts through the expected life of the debt instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount  an
c
of the instrument. When calculating the effective interest rate, all contractual terms are considered. Possible future credit losses are  ia
not taken into account. Charges and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective  l inf
o
interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts are included in the calculation. rm
a
t
io
n
Fair value
The consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial assets, including those carried at amortized 
cost where the values are provided in the notes to the financial statements.
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
O
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price  th
e
at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). For quoted financial  r n
o
assets for which there is an active market, the fair value is the bid price at the reporting date. In the absence of an active market, fair  n
-
f
value is estimated by using present value based or other valuation techniques. Where discounting techniques are applied, the discount  in
a
n
rate is based on current market rates applicable to financial instruments with similar characteristics. The valuation techniques that  c
ia
include unobservable inputs can result in a different outcome than the actual transaction price at which the asset was acquired. Such  l in
f
differences are not recognized in the income statement immediately but are deferred. They are released over time to the income  o
rm
statement in line with the change in factors (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price for the asset.  a
t
Interest accrued to date is not included in the fair value of the financial asset. ion

Derecognition
A A
t a A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the asset’s cash flows expire or when the Group retains the right  t a
 g  g
la to receive cash flows from the asset but has an obligation to pay any received cash flows in full without delay to a third party and  la
n n
c either: has transferred the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or has neither transferred nor retained  c
e e
all the risks and rewards but has transferred control of the asset. Financial assets of which the Group has neither transferred nor 
retained significantly all the risk and rewards and retained control are recognized to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. 
If significantly all risks are retained, the assets are not derecognized.
On derecognition, the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement as a 
realized gain or loss. Any cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in the revaluation reserve in shareholders’ equity 
is also recognized in the income statement.
V Security lending and repurchase agreements V
a a
lue Financial assets that are lent to a third party or that are transferred subject to a repurchase agreement at a fixed price are not  lue
 c  c
re derecognized as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. A liability is recognized for cash (collateral)  re
a a
tio received, on which interest is accrued.  tio
n n
A security that has been received under a borrowing or reverse repurchase agreement is not recognized as an asset. A receivable 
is recognized for any related cash (collateral) paid by Aegon. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as investment 
income. If the Group subsequently sells that security, a liability to repurchase the asset is recognized and initially measured 
at fair value.
C Collateral C
rea With the exception of cash collateral, assets received as collateral are not separately recognized as an asset until the financial asset  rea
t t
in they secure defaults. When cash collateral is recognized, a liability is recorded for the same amount. in

ta b. Real estate ta
in in
ab Investments in real estate include property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. Investments in real estate are  ab
le le
 v presented as 'Investments'. Property that is occupied by the Group and that is not intended to be sold in the near future is classified   v
a a
lu as real estate held for own use and is presented in 'Other assets and receivables'. lu
e e
All property is initially recognized at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the real estate and borrowing cost for long-
term construction projects if recognition criteria are met. Subsequently, investments in real estate are measured at fair value with 
the changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Real estate held for own use is carried at its revalued amount, which 
is the fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated 
F on a straight line basis over the useful life of a building. Land is not depreciated. Revaluation of real estate for own use is recognized  F
in in
an in other comprehensive income and accumulated in revaluation reserve in equity. On revaluation the accumulated depreciation  an
c c
ia is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount. ia
l in l in
f f
o o

n n
Maintenance costs and other subsequent expenditure
Expenditure incurred after initial recognition of the asset is capitalized to the extent that the level of future economic benefits 
of the asset is increased. Costs that restore or maintain the level of future economic benefits are recognized in the income statement

2.9 Derivatives
A
a. Definition t a
 g
Derivatives are financial instruments of which the value changes in response to an underlying variable, that often require little or no net  la
n
initial investment and are settled at a future date. c
e
Assets and liabilities may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of features embedded in contracts held 
at fair value through profit or loss, embedded derivatives that are not considered closely related to the host contract are bifurcated, 
carried at fair value and presented as derivatives. In assessing whether a derivative-like feature is closely related to the contract 
in which it is embedded, the Group considers the similarity of the characteristics of the embedded derivative and the host contract. 
Embedded derivatives that transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as insurance contracts.
Derivatives with positive values are reported as assets and derivatives with negative values are reported as liabilities. Derivatives for 
which the contractual obligation can only be settled by exchanging a fixed amount of cash for a fixed amount of Aegon N.V. equity  V
a
instruments are accounted for in shareholders’ equity. lue
 c
re
a
b. Measurement tio
n
All derivatives recognized on the statement of financial position are carried at fair value.
The fair value is calculated net of the interest accrued to date and is based on market prices, when available. When market prices 
are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied. The valuation techniques 
incorporate all factors that market participants would consider and are based on observable market data, to the extent possible.
c. Hedge accounting
C
As part of its asset liability management, the Group enters into economic hedges to limit its risk exposure. These transactions are  rea
t
assessed to determine whether hedge accounting can and should be applied. in
g
 s
u
s
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk  ta
in
management objective and strategy for the hedge (which includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being  ab
le
used and how hedge effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be highly effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting   v
a
either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated on a  lu
e
prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include 
comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a comparison of the changes in the fair 
value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to the hedged item. A hedging relationship is considered highly effective 
if the results of the hedging instrument are within a ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.
For hedge accounting purposes, a distinction is made between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a  F
in
foreign operation. an
c
ia
Following the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other interbank offered rates  l inf
o
(‘IBORs’) has become a priority for global regulators. There is currently uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these  rm
a
changes, in light of which the following assumptions have been made with respect to hedge accounting: tio
	When considering the ‘highly probable’ requirement, it is assumed that the current benchmark interest rate on which the hedged  n
positions is based will not change as a result of IBOR reform.
	In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be ‘highly effective’ on a forward-looking basis, it is assumed that the current 
benchmark interest rate on which the cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative that hedges it are based is not altered as a 
result of the IBOR reform.
O
	Hedge accounting is not discontinued during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness  th
e
falls outside the required 80-125% range. r n
	For macro hedging the assessment whether the hedged risk component is a separately identifiable, is performed only when  on
-
f
a hedged item is first included in the hedge and not on an ongoing basis. in
a
	The cash flows hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect, is not recycled solely because  nc
ia
cash flows are expected to change. l in
f
o
rm
Fair value hedges a
t
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in the profit and loss  ion
account, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
172 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  173
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is, in the case of interest bearing instruments, 
A A
t a amortized through the profit and loss account over the remaining term of the original hedge or recognized directly when the hedged  t a
 g  g
la item is derecognized. la
n n
c c
e e
Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedging) under the EU ‘carve out’ 
of IFRS-EU. The EU ‘carve out’ macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions thereof) to be viewed in combination 
and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting. Under the EU 
‘carve out’, ineffectiveness in fair value hedge accounting only arises when the revised projection of the amount of cash flows 
in scheduled time buckets falls below the designated amount of that bucket. Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio 
hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the EU ‘carve out’ to mortgage loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
are recognized in the profit and loss account, together with the fair value adjustment on the mortgages (hedged items) insofar 
as attributable to interest rate risk (the hedged risk). 
V V
a a
lue Cash flow hedges lue
 c  c
re Cash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk of a forecasted  re
a a
tio transaction or a recognized asset or liability and could affect profit or loss. To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change  tio
n n
in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders’ equity. Any ineffectiveness 
is recognized directly in the income statement. The amount recorded in shareholders’ equity is released to the income statement 
to coincide with the hedged transaction, except when the hedged transaction is an acquisition of a non-financial asset or liability. In this 
case, the amount in shareholders’ equity is included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
Net investment hedges
C Net investment hedges are hedges of currency exposures on a net investment in a foreign operation. To the extent that the hedge  C
rea is effective, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in the net foreign investment hedging reserve  rea
t t
in in shareholders’ equity. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement. The amount in shareholders’ equity is released  in
g g
 su to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for hedges that are no longer considered effective. When hedge accounting  ab
le le
 v is discontinued for a fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the statement of financial position with changes in its   v
a a
lu fair value recognized in the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued for a cash flow hedge because the cash flow  lu
e e
is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss in shareholders’ equity is recognized immediately in the income statement. 
In other situations where hedge accounting is discontinued for a cash flow hedge, including those where the derivative is sold, 
terminated or exercised, accumulated gains or losses in shareholders’ equity are amortized into the income statement when the income 
statement is impacted by the variability of the cash flow from the hedged item.
F d. Brexit F
in in
an Since January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) is no longer a member of the European Union. Just before the Brexit transition period  an
c c
ia ended after December 31, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on a new “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”  ia
l inf outlining their post-Brexit relationship. Overall, the deal is light on financial services. Aegon no longer enters into new derivatives  l inf
o o
rm transactions with UK counterparties, repapered with EU 27 counterparties and clearing members and transferred a large majority of its  rm
a a
tio derivatives that were cleared at the London Clearing House to EU 27 clearing members and to Eurex in Frankfurt. tio

2.10 Investments in joint arrangements
In general, joint arrangements are contractual agreements whereby the Group undertakes, with other parties, an economic activity that 
is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when it is contractually agreed to share control over an economic activity. Joint control 
exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
O O
t t
h h
e e
r n Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and  r n
o o
n obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Aegon has assessed the nature of its joint  n
- -
f f
in arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. in
a a
n n
c c
ia ia
l in Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill  l in

rm rm
a in successive share purchases, each significant transaction is accounted for separately. a

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  174
The carrying amount is subsequently adjusted to reflect the change in the Group’s share in the net assets of the joint venture and 
A
is subject to impairment testing. The net assets are determined based on the Group’s accounting policies. Any gains and losses recorded  t a
 g
in other comprehensive income by the joint venture are recognized in other comprehensive income and reflected in other reserves  la
n
in shareholders’ equity, while the share in the joint ventures net income is recognized as a separate line item in the consolidated income  c
e
statement. The Group’s share in losses is recognized until the investment in the joint ventures' equity and any other long-term interest 
that are part of the net investment are reduced to nil, unless guarantees exist.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and the joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the entity, with the exception of losses that are evidence of impairment which are recognized immediately. Own equity instruments 
of Aegon N.V. that are held by the joint venture are not eliminated.
On disposal of an interest in a joint venture, the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized 
in the income statement and gains and losses previously recorded directly in the revaluation reserve are reversed and recorded through  V
a
the income statement. lue
 c
re
a
2.11 Investments in associates tio
n
Entities over which the Group has significant influence through power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions, but 
which do not meet the definition of a subsidiary, are accounted for using the equity method. Interests held by venture capital entities, 
mutual funds and investment funds that qualify as an associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value through profit 
or loss. Interests held by the Group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds that are managed on a fair value 
basis, are also accounted for as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Interests in associates are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill arising on acquisition. Negative goodwill  C
is recognized in the income statement on the acquisition date. If associates are obtained in successive share purchases, each significant  rea
t
transaction is accounted for separately. in

2.12 Reinsurance assets
Reinsurance contracts are contracts entered into by the Group in order to receive compensation for claims/benefits incurred 
on contracts written by the Group (outgoing reinsurance). Reinsurance assets are also held as part of exiting the business. For 
contracts transferring sufficient insurance risk, a reinsurance asset is recognized for the expected future benefits, less expected future 
reinsurance premiums. Reinsurance contracts with insufficient insurance risk transfer are accounted for as investment or service 
O
contracts, depending on the nature of the agreement. th
e
r n
o
Reinsurance assets are measured consistently with the assumptions associated with the underlying insurance contracts and  n
-
f
in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract. They are subject to impairment testing and are derecognized when  in
a
n
the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract is transferred to another party. c
ia
l in
f
Aegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities when entering into reinsurance transactions, therefore the reserves relating to the underlying  o
rm
insurance contracts will continue to be reported on the consolidated statement of financial position during the contractual term  a
t
of the underlying contracts. ion

Reinsurance premiums, commissions and claim settlements are accounted for in the same way as the original contracts for which 
A A

c 2.13 Deferred expenses c
e e
a. Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC)
DPAC relates to all insurance contracts as well as investment contracts with discretionary participation features and represents directly 
attributable costs that are related to the selling, underwriting and initiating of these insurance contracts.
DPAC are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable and are subsequently amortized based on factors such as expected gross 
profit margins. For products sold in the United States and Asia with amortization based on expected gross profit margins or revenues, 
the amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date and any change in estimates is recognized in the income 
statement. Estimates include, but are not limited to: an economic perspective in terms of future returns on bond and equity 
V instruments, mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions, maintenance expenses and expected inflation rates.  V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re For all products, DPAC, in conjunction with VOBA where appropriate, is assessed for recoverability at least annually as part  re
a a
tio of the liability adequacy test for each reporting period. If appropriate, the assumptions included in the determination of estimated gross  tio
n n
profits or revenues are adjusted. The portion of DPAC that is determined not to be recoverable is charged to the income statement.
For products sold in the United States and Asia, when unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing 
the insurance liabilities, DPAC is adjusted to equal the effect that the realization of the gains or losses (through sale or impairment) 
would have had on its measurement. This is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation 
reserve in shareholders’ equity.
C C
rea DPAC is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed. rea

g g
 su b. Deferred cost of reinsurance  su
s s
ta A deferred cost of reinsurance is established when Aegon enters into a reinsurance transaction, except for reinsurance transactions  ta
in in
ab that are entered into as part of a plan to exit a business. When Aegon enters into a reinsurance contract as part of a plan to exit  ab
le le
 v a business, an immediate loss is recognized in the income statement. Upon reinsurance, Aegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities,   v
a a
lu so the reserves relating to the underlying reinsured contracts will continue to be reported in the consolidated statement of financial  lu
e e
position during the contractual term of the underlying contracts.
The difference, if any, between amounts paid in a reinsurance transaction and the amount of the liabilities relating to the underlying 
reinsured contracts is part of the deferred cost of reinsurance.
F When losses on buying reinsurance are deferred, the amortization is based on the assumptions of the underlying insurance contracts.  F
in in
an In the Netherlands, the amortization is based on the percentage of premium paid on the reinsurance contract. For products  an
c c
ia sold in the Americas and Asia where the amortization is based on expected gross profit margins (EGPs), these EGPs will be net  ia
l inf of reinsurance (i.e., net of actual reinsurance cash flows that exceed expected reinsurance cash flows). The amortization is recognized  l inf
o o
rm in the income statement. rm

c. Deferred transaction costs
Deferred transaction costs relate to investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render 
investment management services. Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing these investment management contracts 
are recognized as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and if it is probable that they will be recovered.
O O
th For contracts involving both the origination of a financial liability and the provision of investment management services, only  th
e e
r n the transaction costs allocated to the servicing component are deferred. The other transaction costs are included in the carrying  r n
o o

a a
n n
c The deferred transaction costs are amortized in line with fee income, unless there is evidence that another method better represents  c

2.14 Other assets and receivables
A
Other assets include trade and other receivables, prepaid expenses, equipment and real estate held for own use. Trade and other  t a
 g
receivables are initially recognized at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Equipment is initially carried at cost,  la
n
depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful life to its residual value and is subject to impairment testing. The accounting for real  c
e
estate held for own use is described in note 2.7 Investments.
2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at banks and in-hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments generally with original maturities 
of three months or less that are readily convertible to known cash amounts, are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value and 
are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements. Money market investments that are held for investment purposes 
(backing insurance liabilities, investment liabilities or equity based on asset liability management considerations) are not included 
in cash and cash equivalents but are presented as investments or investments for account of policyholders. 
V
a
2.16 Impairment of assets lu
e
 c
An asset is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the amount that would be recovered through its use or sale. For tangible and  re
a
intangible assets, financial assets and reinsurance assets, if not held at fair value through profit or loss, the recoverable amount  tio
n
of the asset is estimated when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. Irrespective of the indications, goodwill and other 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that are not amortized, are tested at least annually. 
There are a number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring investments and determining 
if impairment exists. These risks and uncertainties include the risk that the Group’s assessment of an issuer’s ability to meet all of its 
contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer and the risk that the economic outlook 
will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated. Any of these situations could result in a charge  C
against the income statement to the extent of the impairment charge recorded. rea
t
in
g
a. Impairment of non-financial assets  su
s
Assets are tested individually for impairment when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. For goodwill and intangible  ta
in
assets with an undefined life, an impairment test is performed at least once a year or more frequently as a result of an event or change  ab
le
in circumstances that would indicate an impairment charge may be necessary. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference   v
a
between the carrying and the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of an asset’s value in use and its fair value less  lu
e
cost of disposal. The value in use represents the discounted future net cash flows from the continuing use and ultimate disposal 
of the asset and reflects its known inherent risks and uncertainties. The valuation utilizes the best available information, including 
assumptions and projections considered reasonable and supportable by management. The assumptions used in the valuation involve 
significant judgments and estimates. Refer to note 29 Intangible assets for more details.
Impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income to the extent that they offset a previously recorded revaluation reserve  F
in
relating to the same item. Any further losses are recognized directly in the income statement. Impairment of deferred policy acquisition  an
c
costs is included in note 15 Impairment charges/(reversals). ia
l in
f
o
With the exception of goodwill, impairment losses are reversed when there is evidence that there has been a change in the estimates  rm
a
used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the recognition of the last impairment loss. The reversal is recognized  tio
n
in the income statement to the extent that it reverses impairment losses previously recognized in the income statement. The carrying 
amount after reversal cannot exceed the amount that would have been recognized had no impairment taken place. 
Non-financial assets that only generate cash flows in combination with other assets and liabilities are tested for impairment 
at the level of the cash-generating unit. The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, 
O
is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies  th
e
of the combination. The allocation is based on the level at which goodwill is monitored internally and cannot be larger than  r n
o
an operating segment. When impairing a cash-generating unit, any goodwill allocated to the unit is first written-off and recognized  n
-
f
in the income statement. The remaining impairment loss is allocated on a pro rata basis among the other assets, on condition that  in
a
n
the resulting carrying amounts do not fall below the individual assets’ recoverable amounts.  c
ia
l in
f
b. Impairment of debt instruments o
rm
Debt instruments are impaired if there is objective evidence that a credit event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset  a
t
that has a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows. Individually significant loans and other receivables are first assessed  ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
176 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  177
separately. All non-impaired assets measured at amortized cost are then grouped by credit risk characteristics and collectively tested 
A A
t a for impairment.  t a
 g  g
la la
n n
c For debt instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced through an allowance  c
e e
account. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying and recoverable amount of the investment. 
The recoverable amount is determined by discounting the estimated probable future cash flows at the original effective interest rate 
of the asset. For variable interest debt instruments, the current effective interest rate under the contract is applied. 
For debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, the asset is impaired to its fair value. Any unrealized loss previously recognized 
in other comprehensive income is taken to the income statement in the impairment loss. After impairment the interest accretion 
on debt instruments is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring 
the impairment loss.
V V
a a
lue Impairment losses recognized for debt instruments can be reversed if in subsequent periods the amount of the impairment loss  lue
 c  c
re decreases and that decrease can be objectively related to a credit event occurring after the impairment was recognized. For debt  re
a a
tio instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount after reversal cannot exceed what the amortized cost would have been  tio
n n
at the reversal date, had the impairment not been recognized.
c. Impairment of equity instruments
For equity instruments, objective evidence of impairment of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale 
includes information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic 
or legal environment in which the issuer operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity instrument may not 
C be recovered. A significant or prolonged decline in fair value below initial cost is also considered objective evidence of impairment and  C
rea always results in a loss being recognized in the income statement. Significant or prolonged decline is defined as an unrealized loss  rea
t t
in position for generally more than six months or a fair value of less than 80% of the cost price of the investment. Equity investments are  in
g g
 su impaired to the asset’s fair value and any unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in shareholders’ equity is taken to the income   su
s s
ta statement as an impairment loss. The amount exceeding the balance of previously recognized unrealized gains or losses is recognized  ta
in in
ab in the income statement. If an available-for- sale equity security is impaired based upon Aegon’s qualitative or quantitative impairment  ab
le le
 v criteria, any further declines in the fair value at subsequent reporting dates are recognized as impairments. Therefore, at each reporting   v
a a
lu period, for an equity security that is determined to be impaired based upon Aegon’s impairment criteria, an impairment is recognized for  lu
e e
the difference between the fair value and the original cost basis, less any previously recognized impairments.
Impairment losses on equity instruments cannot be reversed.
d. Impairment of reinsurance assets
F Reinsurance assets are impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition  F
in in
an of the reinsurance asset, that not all amounts due under the terms of the contract may be received. In such a case, the value  an
c c
ia of the reinsurance asset recoverable is determined based on the best estimate of future cash flows, taking into consideration  ia
l inf the reinsurer’s current and expected future financial conditions plus any collateral held in trust for Aegon’s benefit. The carrying value  l inf
o o
rm is reduced to this calculated recoverable value, and the impairment loss recognized in the income statement.  rm

2.17 Equity
Financial instruments that are issued by the Group are classified as equity if they represent a residual interest in the assets of the Group 
after deducting all of its liabilities and the Group has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle 
its contractual obligation. In addition to common shares, the Group has issued perpetual securities. Perpetual securities have no final 
maturity date, repayment is at the discretion of Aegon and for junior perpetual capital securities, Aegon has the option to defer coupon 
O O
th payments at its discretion. The perpetual capital securities are classified as equity rather than debt, are measured at par and those that  th
e e
r n are denominated in US dollars are translated into euro using historical exchange rates. r n
o o
n n
- -
f f
in Non-cumulative subordinated notes were identified as a compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. For  in
a a
n n
c these non-cumulative subordinated notes, Aegon had an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset  c
ia ia
l in to settle the coupon payments. The redemption of the principal was however not at the discretion of Aegon and therefore Aegon had  l in
f f
o a contractual obligation to settle the redemption in cash or another financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and  o
rm rm
a liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for Aegon. Compound instruments were separated into liability components and equity  a
t t
ion components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes was equal to the present value of the redemption  ion
amount and carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The unwinding of the discount of this component was 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  178
recognized in the income statement. At initial recognition the equity component was assigned the residual amount after deducting 
A
the liability component from the fair value of the instrument as a whole. The equity component in US dollars was translated into euro  t a
 g
using historical exchange rates. With effect on May 15, 2018, Aegon has exercised its right to redeem USD 525 million non-cumulative  la
n
subordinated notes, subsequently leading to their redemption. As the Group's obligation under the contract has expired, the liability  c
e
and equity components of the non-cumulative subordinated notes have been derecognized. 
Incremental external costs that are directly attributable to the issuing or buying back of own equity instruments are recognized 
in equity, net of tax. For compound instruments incremental external costs that were directly attributable to the issuing or buying back 
of the compound instruments were recognized proportionate to the equity component and liability component, net of tax.
The Group recognizes the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according 
to where it originally recognized the past transactions or events that generated the distributable profits. A liability for non-cumulative 
dividends payable is not recognized until the dividends have been declared and approved. V
a
lu
e
 c
Treasury shares are shares issued by Aegon N.V. that are held by Aegon, one of its subsidiaries or by another entity controlled  re
a
by Aegon. Treasury shares are deducted from Group equity, regardless of the objective of the transaction. No gain or loss is recognized  tio
n
in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the instruments. If sold, the difference between the carrying 
amount and the proceeds is reflected in retained earnings. The consideration paid or received is recognized directly in shareholders’ 
equity. All treasury shares are eliminated in the calculation of earnings per share and dividend per common share.
2.18 Trust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings 
A financial instrument issued by the Group is classified as a liability if the contractual obligation must be settled in cash or another 
financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for the Group.  C
re
a
t
Trust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings are initially recognized at their fair value including directly attributable  in
g
transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, with the exception of specific   su
s
borrowings that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate, or significantly reduce, an accounting mismatch,  ta
in
or specific borrowings which are carried as at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.  ab
le
The liability is derecognized when the Group’s obligation under the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.  v
a
lu
e
Subordinated borrowings include the liability component of non-cumulative subordinated notes. These notes are identified as a 
compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. Compound instruments are separated into equity components 
and liability components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes is related to the redemption amount. For 
further information on the accounting policy of the non-cumulative subordinated notes refer to note 2.17 Equity.
2.19 Insurance contracts F
in
Insurance contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. In accordance with this standard, Aegon continues to apply  an
c
the existing accounting policies that were applied prior to the adoption of IFRS-EU with certain modifications allowed by IFRS 4 for  ia
standards effective subsequent to adoption. Aegon applies, in general, non-uniform accounting policies for insurance liabilities  l inf
o
and insurance related intangible assets to the extent that it was allowed under Dutch Accounting Principles. As a result, specific  rm
a
methodologies applied may differ between Aegon’s operations as they may reflect local regulatory requirements and local practices for  tio
n
specific product features in these local markets. At the time of IFRS-EU adoption, Aegon was applying US GAAP for its United States 
operations whereas in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, Aegon was applying Dutch Accounting Principles. Since adoption 
of IFRS-EU, Aegon has considered new and amended standards in those GAAPs which have become effective subsequent to the date 
of transition to IFRS-EU. If any changes are made to current accounting policies for insurance contracts, these will be in accordance 
with IFRS 4.
O

Insurance contracts are contracts under which the Group accepts a significant risk – other than a financial risk – from a policyholder  r n
o
by agreeing to compensate the beneficiary on the occurrence of an uncertain future event by which he or she will be adversely  n
-
f
affected. Contracts that do not meet this definition are accounted for as investment contracts. The Group reviews homogeneous books  in
a
n
of contracts to assess whether the underlying contracts transfer significant insurance risk on an individual basis. This is considered  c
ia
the case when at least one scenario with commercial substance can be identified in which the Group has to pay significant additional  l in
f
benefits to the policyholder. Contracts that have been classified as insurance are not reclassified subsequently. o

A A

e e
Insurance assets and liabilities are valued in accordance with the accounting principles that were applied by the Group prior 
to the transition to IFRS-EU and with consideration of standards effective subsequent to the date of transition to IFRS-EU, as further 
described in the following paragraphs. In order to reflect the specific nature of the products written, subsidiaries are allowed to apply 
local accounting principles to the measurement of insurance contracts. All valuation methods used by the subsidiaries are based 
on the general principle that the carrying amount of the net liability must be sufficient to meet any reasonably foreseeable obligation 
resulting from the insurance contracts. 
a. Life insurance contracts
V Life insurance contracts are insurance contracts with life-contingent benefits. The measurement of the liability for life insurance  V
a a
lue contracts varies depending on the nature of the product.  lue
 c  c
re re
a a
tio Liabilities arising from traditional life insurance products that are offered by Aegon, particularly those with fixed and guaranteed  tio
n n
account terms, are typically measured using the net premium method. Under this method the liability is determined as the sum 
of the discounted value of the expected benefits and future administration expenses directly related to the contract, less 
the discounted value of the expected theoretical premiums that would be required to meet the future cash outflows based 
on the valuation assumptions used. The liability is either based on current assumptions or calculated using the assumptions established 
at the time the contract was issued, in which case a margin for risk and adverse deviation is generally included. Furthermore, the liability 
for life insurance comprises reserves for unearned premiums and accrued annuity benefits payable.
C C
rea Depending on local accounting principles, the liability may include amounts for future services on contracts where the policy  rea
t t
in administration charges are higher in the initial years than in subsequent years.  in
g g
 s  s
u u
s s
ta Terms and conditions, including participation features, are considered when establishing the insurance liabilities. Where the Group has  ta
in in
ab discretion over the amount or timing of the bonuses distributed resulting from participation features, a liability is recognized equal  ab
le le
 v to the amount that is available at the reporting date for future distribution to policyholders.  v
a a
lu lu
e e
In establishing the liability, guaranteed minimum benefits issued to the policyholder are measured as described 
in note 2.19.c Embedded derivatives or, if bifurcated from the host contract, as described in note 2.9 Derivatives.
b. Life insurance contracts for account of policyholders
Life insurance contracts under which the policyholder bears the risks associated with the underlying investments are classified 
F as insurance contracts for account of policyholders.  F
in in
a a
n n
c c
ia The liability for the insurance contracts for account of policyholders is measured at the policyholder account balance. Contracts with  ia
l inf unit-denominated payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund. If applicable,  l inf
o o
rm the liability representing the nominal value of the policyholder unit account is amortized over the term of the contract so that interest  rm
a a
tio on actuarial funding is at an expected rate of return. tio
n n
c. Embedded derivatives
Life insurance contracts may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of policyholder options to surrender 
the contract at a fixed amount, contractual features that are not closely related to the insurance contract and that do not themselves 
meet the definition of insurance contracts are accounted for as derivatives.
O O
t t
h h
e e
r n Guaranteed minimum benefits r n
o o
n Certain life insurance contracts, issued by the Group, contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Bifurcated guaranteed minimum benefits  n
- -
f f
in are classified as derivatives. in
a a
n n
c c
ia ia
l in In the United States, the additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated is determined each period  l in
f f
o by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over  o
rm rm
a the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment  a
t t
ion to the additional liability is recognized in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are commonly based  ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  180
on the average benefits payable over a range of stochastic scenarios. Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates 
A
a percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contract holder. t a
 g
la
n
In the Netherlands, an additional liability is established for guaranteed minimum investment returns on group pension plans with profit  c
e
sharing and on traditional insurance contracts, with profit sharing based on an external interest index, that are not bifurcated. These 
guarantees are measured at fair value.
d. Shadow accounting
Shadow accounting allows that all gains and losses on investments affect the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities 
in the same way, regardless of whether they are realized or unrealized and regardless of whether the unrealized gains and losses are 
recognized in the income statement or through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve. In some instances, realized 
gains or losses on investments have a direct effect on the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities. For example, some 
insurance contracts include benefits that are contractually based on the investment returns realized by the insurer. In addition,  V
a
realization of gains or losses on available-for-sale investments can lead to unlocking of VOBA or DPAC and can also affect the outcome  lue
 c
of the liability adequacy test to the extent that it considers actual future investment returns. For similar changes in unrealized gains  re
a
and losses, shadow accounting is applied. If an unrealized gain or loss triggers a shadow accounting adjustment to VOBA, DPAC  tio
n
or the insurance liabilities, the corresponding adjustment is recognized through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve, 
together with the unrealized gain or loss. 
Some profit sharing schemes issued by the Group entitle the policyholder to a bonus which is based on the actual total return 
on specific assets held. To the extent that the bonus relates to gains or losses on available-for-sale investments for which 
the unrealized gains or losses are recognized through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve in shareholders' 
equity, shadow accounting is applied. This means that the increase in the liability is also charged through other comprehensive  C
income to shareholders' equity to offset the unrealized gains rather than to the income statement. rea
t
in
g
e. Non-life insurance contracts   su
s
Non-life insurance contracts are insurance contracts where the insured event is not life-contingent. For non-life products the insurance  ta
in
liability generally includes reserves for unearned premiums, unexpired risk, inadequate premium levels and outstanding claims and  ab
le
benefits. No catastrophe or equalization reserves are included in the measurement of the liability.   v
a
lu
e
The reserve for unearned premiums includes premiums received for risks that have not yet expired. Generally, the reserve is released 
over the coverage period of the premium and is recognized as premium income. 
The liability for outstanding claims and benefits is established for claims that have not been settled and any related cash flows, such 
as claims handling costs. It includes claims that have been incurred but have not been reported to the Group. The liability is calculated 
at the reporting date using statistical methods based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a margin for adverse  F
in
deviation. Liabilities for claims subject to periodic payment are calculated using actuarial methods consistent with those applied to life  an
c
insurance contracts. Discounting is applied if allowed by the local accounting principles used to measure the insurance liabilities.  ia
Discounting of liabilities is generally applied when there is a high level of certainty concerning the amount and settlement term  l inf
o
of the cash outflows. rm
a
t
io
n
f. Liability adequacy testing
At each reporting date, the adequacy of the life insurance liabilities (including life insurance contracts for account of policyholders), net 
of VOBA and DPAC, is assessed using a liability adequacy test.
All tests performed within the Group are based on current estimates of all contractual future cash flows, including related cash flows 
O
from policyholder options and guarantees. A number of valuation methods are applied, including discounted cash flow methods,  th
e
option pricing models and stochastic modeling. Aggregation levels are set either on geographical jurisdiction or at the level of portfolio  r n
o
of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a single portfolio. Specifically, in the Netherlands  n
-
f
the liability adequacy test is performed on a consolidated basis for all life and non-life business, whereas in the Americas and the UK it  in
a
n
is performed at the level of the portfolio of contracts. To the extent that the tests involve discounting of future cash flows, the interest  c
ia
rate applied is based on market rates or is based on management’s expectation of the future return on investments. These future  l in
f
returns on investments take into account management’s best estimate related to the actual investments and, where applicable,  o
rm
reinvestments of these investments at maturity. Aegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability  a
t
adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost  ion
in the statement of financial position. For details on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
180 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 2  181
to note 44 Fair value. Only differences between the fair value and the book value build up during the period when the assets were 
A A
t a allocated to the insurance portfolio are included in the LAT. t a
 g  g
la la
n n
c To the extent that the account balances are insufficient to meet future benefits and expenses, any resulting deficiency is recognized  c
e e
in the income statement, initially by impairing the DPAC and VOBA and subsequently by establishing an insurance liability for 
the remaining loss, unless shadow loss recognition has taken place. In the Netherlands, in situations where market interest rates 
for the valuation of debt securities lead to a change in the revaluation reserve, and where the result of using the same assumptions 
for the liabilities could lead to a deficiency in the liability adequacy test that should be recognized in the income statement, shadow 
loss recognition is applied. Shadow loss recognition is applied to the extent that the deficiency of the insurance liabilities relates 
to the revaluation of debt securities as a result of movements in interest rates, the addition to the insurance liabilities is then offset 
against the revaluation reserve. If in subsequent periods such a deficiency of the insurance liability is no longer applicable, shadow loss 
recognition is reversed via the revaluation reserve.

tio is increased to the extent that the future claims and expenses in respect of current insurance contracts exceed the future premiums  tio
n n
plus the current unearned premium reserve.
2.20 Investment contracts
Aegon conducts its operations through the following type of investment contracts:
Contracts issued by the Group that do not transfer significant insurance risk, but do transfer financial risk from the policyholder 
C to the Group are accounted for as investment contracts. Depending on whether the Group or the policyholder runs the risks associated  C
rea with the investments allocated to the contract, the liabilities are classified as investment contracts or as investment contracts for  rea
t t
in account of policyholders. Investment contract liabilities are recognized when the contract is entered into and are derecognized when  in
g g
 su the contract expires, is discharged, cancelled or substantially modified.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab a. Investment contracts with discretionary participation features ab
le le
 v Some investment contracts have participation features whereby the policyholder has the right to receive potentially significant   v
a a
lu additional benefits which are based on the performance of a specified pool of investment contracts, specific investments held  lu
e e
by the Group or on the issuer’s net income. If the Group has discretion over the amount or timing of the distribution of the returns 
to policyholders, the investment contract liability is measured based on the accounting principles that apply to insurance contracts with 
similar features.
Some unitized investment contracts provide policyholders with the option to switch between funds with and without discretionary 
F participation features. The entire contract is accounted for as an investment contract with discretionary participation features  F
in in
an if there is evidence of actual switching resulting in discretionary participation benefits that are a significant part of the total  an
c c
ia contractual benefits. ia
l in l in
f f
o o
rm b. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features rm
a a
tio At inception, investment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost.  tio
n n
Investment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost based on the expected cash flows and 
using the effective interest rate method. The expected future cash flows are re-estimated at each reporting date and the carrying 
amount of the financial liability is recalculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using the financial liability’s original 
effective interest rate. Any adjustment is immediately recognized in the income statement. For these investment contracts deposit 
O O
th accounting is applied, meaning that deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability. th
e e
r n r n
o o
n The consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial liabilities, including those carried  n

f f
in at amortized cost. As these contracts are not quoted in active markets, their value is determined by using valuation techniques, such  in
a a

c as discounted cash flow methods and stochastic modeling. For investment contracts without discretionary participation features that  c
ia ia
l in can be cancelled by the policyholder, the fair value cannot be less than the surrender value. l in

c. Investment contracts for account of policyholders
A
Investment contracts for account of policyholders are investment contracts for which the actual return on investments allocated  t a
 g
to the contract is passed on to the policyholder. Also included are participations held by third parties in consolidated investment funds  la
n
that meet the definition of a financial liability. c
e
Investment contracts for account of policyholders are designated at fair value through profit or loss. Contracts with unit-denominated 
payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund. 
For unit-linked contracts without discretionary participation features and subject to actuarial funding, the Group recognizes 
a liability at the funded amount of the units. The difference between the gross value of the units and the funded value is treated 
as an initial fee paid by the policyholder for future asset management services and recognized as a deferred revenue liability, refer 
to note 2.23 Deferred gains.
V
a
2.21 Provisions lu
e
 c
A provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will  re
a
result in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. Management exercises judgment in evaluating  tio
n
the probability that a loss will be incurred.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date, considering all its inherent risks and uncertainties, as well as the time value of money. The estimate of the amount of a loss 
requires management judgment in the selection of a proper calculation model and the specific assumptions related to the particular 
exposure. The unwinding of the effect of discounting is recorded in the income statement as an interest expense.
C
Onerous contracts rea
t
With the exception of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features for which potential future  in
g
losses are already considered in establishing the liability, a provision is recognized for onerous contracts in which the unavoidable costs   su
s
of meeting the resulting obligations exceed the expected future economic benefits. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect  ta
in
the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising  ab
le
from failure to fulfill it.  v

lu
e
2.22 Assets and liabilities relating to employee benefits
a. Short-term employee benefits
A liability is recognized for the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be settled within one year after 
the end of the period in which the service was rendered. Accumulating short-term absences are recognized over the period in which 
the service is provided. Benefits that are not service-related are recognized when the event that gives rise to the obligation occurs.
F
in
b. Post-employment benefits  an
c
The Group has issued defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. A plan is classified as a defined contribution plan when  ia
the Group has no further obligation than the payment of a fixed contribution. All other plans are classified as defined benefit plans. l inf
o
rm
a
Defined contribution plans tio
n
The contribution payable to a defined contribution plan for services provided is recognized as an expense in the income statement. 
An asset is recognized to the extent that the contribution paid exceeds the amount due for services provided.
Defined benefit plans
Measurement
O
The defined benefit obligation is based on the terms and conditions of the plan applicable on the reporting date. In measuring  th
e
the defined benefit obligation the Group uses the projected unit credit method and actuarial assumptions that represent  r n
o
the management's best estimates. The benefits are discounted using an interest rate based on the market yield for high-quality  n
-
f
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity that  in
a
n
approximate the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the liability include  c
ia
the discount rate, estimated future salary increases, mortality rates and price inflation. To the extent that actual experience deviates  l in
f
from these assumptions, the valuation of defined benefit plans and the level of pension expenses recognized in the future may  o
rm
be affected. Plan improvements (either vested or unvested) are recognized in the income statement at the date when the plan  a
t
improvement occurs. ion

Plan assets are qualifying insurance policies and assets held by long-term employee benefit funds that can only be used to pay 
A A
t a the employee benefits under the plan and are not available to the Group’s creditors. They are measured at fair value and are deducted  t a
 g  g
la from the defined benefit obligation in determining the amount recognized on the statement of financial position. la

Profit or loss recognition
The cost of the defined benefit plans are determined at the beginning of the year and comprise the following components:
	Current year service cost which is recognized in profit or loss; and
	Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in profit or loss. 
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in other comprehensive income are revisited quarterly 
and are not allowed to be reclassified to profit or loss in a subsequent period.
V Deducted from current year service cost are discretionary employee contributions and employee contributions that are linked to service  V
a a
lue (those which are independent of the number of years of service). Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is determined  lue
 c  c
re by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the applicable discount rate. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability  re
a a
tio (asset) comprises interest income on plan assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation. Whereby interest income on plan  tio
n n
assets is a component of the return on plan assets and is determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the applicable 
discount rate. The difference between the interest income on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets is included 
in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset).
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise of:
	Actuarial gains and losses;
C 	The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset); and C
rea 	Any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). rea

ia c. Share-based payments  ia
l inf The Group has issued share-based plans that entitle selected employees to receive Aegon N.V. common shares, subject to pre-defined  l inf
o o
rm conditions such as the grant price of the shares and (business and personal) performance criteria. The number of shares that will vest  rm
a a
tio partly depends on Aegon’s relative total shareholder return in comparison with a peer group.  tio
n n
The expenses recognized for these plans are based on the fair value on the grant date of the shares. The fair value is measured 
at the market price of Aegon N.V. common shares, adjusted to take into account the non-vesting and market conditions upon which 
the shares were granted. For example, where the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor 
is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. For the determination of factors such as expected dividends, 
O O
th market observable data has been considered. In addition, where the relative total shareholder return is included in the performance  th
e e
r n criteria, this factor represents a market condition and hence is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. r n

a The withholding of shares to fund the payment to the tax authority in respect of the employee’s withholding tax obligation associated  a

the payment exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity instruments withheld.

2.23 Deferred gains

2.24 Tax assets and liabilities
a. Current tax receivables and payables
Tax receivables and payables for current and prior periods are measured at the amount that is expected to be received from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax treatment of transactions or events requires judgment and is often complex and may lead 
to discussions with tax authorities. Consequently, in a number of jurisdictions, prior year tax returns remain open and subject to tax 
authority approval or pending litigation for a number of years. The tax assets and liabilities reported are based on the best available 
information, supported by external advice if necessary, and are reflecting uncertainties. Differences between the final outcome and 
the estimates originally made are accounted for in the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which reasonable  V
a
certainty is obtained. Measurement is done using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. lue
 c
re
a
b. Deferred tax assets and liabilities tio
n
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying 
value of an item and its tax value, with the exception of differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill and of assets and 
liabilities that do not impact taxable or accounting profits. A tax asset is recognized for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is 
probable at the reporting date that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits 
can be utilized. 
Deferred tax liabilities relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are not recognized if the Group  C
is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the difference will not be reversed  rea
t
in the foreseeable future. in
g
 s
u
s
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed at each reporting period and are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply  ta
in
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Since there is no absolute assurance that these assets will ultimately be realized,  ab
le
management reviews Aegon’s deferred tax positions at each reporting period to determine if it is probable that the assets will   v
a
be realized. These reviews include, among other things, the nature and amount of the taxable income and deductible expenses,  lu
e
the expected timing when certain assets will be used or liabilities will be required to be reported and the reliability of historical 
profitability of businesses expected to provide future earnings. Furthermore, management considers tax-planning opportunities 
it can utilize to increase the likelihood that the tax assets will be realized. The carrying amount is not discounted and reflects 
the Group’s expectations concerning the manner of recovery or settlement.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in relation to the underlying transaction either in profit and loss, other comprehensive  F
in
income or directly in equity. an
c
ia
2.25 Contingent assets and liabilities l inf
o
Contingent assets are disclosed in the notes if the inflow of economic benefits is probable, but not virtually certain. When the inflow  rm
a
of economic benefits becomes virtually certain, the asset is no longer contingent and its recognition is appropriate.  tio
n
A provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will result 
in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the outflow of economic benefits is not probable, 
a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.
O
2.26 Premium income th
e
Gross premiums, including recurring and single premiums, from life and non-life insurance and investment contracts with discretionary  r n
o
participation features are recognized as revenue when they become receivable. For products where deposit accounting is required,  n
-
f
the deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability. For these products the surrender  in
a
n
charges and charges assessed have been included in gross premiums.  c
ia
l in
f
Premium loadings for installment payments and additional payments by the policyholder towards costs borne by the insurer are  o
rm
included in the gross premiums. Rebates that form part of the premium rate, such as no-claim rebates, are deducted from the gross  a
t
premium, others are recognized as an expense. Depending on the applicable local accounting principles, bonuses that are used  ion

c 2.27 Investment income c
e e
For interest-bearing assets, interest is recognized as it accrues and is calculated using the effective interest rate method. Fees and 
commissions that are an integral part of the effective yield of the financial assets or liabilities are recognized as an adjustment 
to the effective interest rate of the instrument. Investment income includes the interest income and dividend income on financial assets 
carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Investment income also includes rental income due.
2.28 Fee and commission income
V Fees and commissions from investment management services and mutual funds are performed on an ongoing basis evenly throughout  V
a a
lue the year and are accounted for monthly (1/12 of the contractual agreement). Performance fees may be charged to policyholders  lue
 c  c
re in the event of outperformance in the investments compared to predefined benchmark levels. They are accounted for only when  re
a a
tio specified hurdles for generating performance fees are achieved i.e. when the full performance obligation is met. tio
n n
Aegon acts also as an insurance broker selling insurance contracts of other insurance companies to policyholders and receiving direct 
sales commission as well as commissions over time when the same policyholders renew their contracts. These commissions are 
recognized only when received as policyholders’ renewals are not certain enough to be recorded upfront.
2.29 Policyholder claims and benefits

2.33 Leases

information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. V
a
lu
e
Policy applicable from January 1, 2019  cre
a
As a lessee tio
n
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially 
measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying 
asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset 
is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life 
of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same 
basis as those of real estate and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses (using  C
the same rate to measure the lease liability), if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. rea
t
in
g
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date,   su
s
discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing  ta
in
rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost  ab
le
using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an   v
a
index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if  lu
e
the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. The Group presents right-
of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘Other assets and receivables’ and lease liabilities in ‘Other 
liabilities’ in the statement of financial position.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities 
for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including small office equipment.  F
in
The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. an

3  Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies
Application of the accounting policies in the preparation of the financial statements requires management to apply judgment involving 
V assumptions and estimates concerning future results or other developments, including the likelihood, timing or amount of future  V
a a
lue transactions or events. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. Included  lue
 c  c
re among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are: fair value  re
a a
tio of certain invested assets and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (please refer to paragraph 2.13), value of business acquired  tio
n n
and other purchased intangible assets (please refer to paragraph 2.6), goodwill (please refer to paragraph 2.6), policyholder claims 
and benefits (please refer to paragraph 2.29), insurance guarantees (please refer to paragraph 2.19), pension plans (please refer 
to paragraph 2.22), income taxes (please refer to paragraph 2.24) and the potential effects of resolving litigation matters (please refer 
to paragraph 2.25). Accounting policies that are critical to the financial statement presentation and that require complex estimates 
or significant judgment are described in the following sections.
Uncertainty resulting from COVID-19
C C
rea During 2020 the world saw substantial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside related market volatility and impacts  rea
t t
in on mortality and morbidity, there continued to be general uncertainty with respect to how the pandemic would play out and what  in
g g
 su the resulting economic consequences might be.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab While some lines of business saw lower premiums and deposits and higher incurred claims over the course of 2020, Aegon currently  ab
le le
 v believes there is insufficient credible experience with which to update actuarial assumptions for COVID-19 specifically. In certain   v
a a
lu businesses, Aegon has incurred losses related to COVID-19. In the Americas, Aegon recorded unfavorable life mortality results  lu
e e
of EUR 110 million which can be specifically attributed to COVID-19 based on the cause of death reported on the death certificate. 
However, actual COVID-19 related deaths were likely higher as not all of the deceased were tested for COVID-19 and/or were reported 
as COVID-19 deaths.
Aegon experienced positive morbidity results in its Long Term Care (LTC) block during 2020, a portion of which is believed to have been 
F driven by COVID-19. Elevated claim terminations among customers in LTC facilities, some of which was likely caused by COVID-19, led  F
in in
an to greater releases of reserves than expected. At the same time, there was a material decrease in the number of new LTC claims which  an
c c
ia may have been driven by the fear of COVID-19. However, there is a likelihood that as the COVID-19 pandemic situation improves, there  ia
l inf may be an increase in these eligible, but currently deferred claims. As a result, Aegon has established an additional, Incurred But Not  l inf
o o

a a
t t
io io
n n
Impairment losses were higher than in previous reporting periods which was mainly driven by COVID-19 impacts. Impairment 
assessments were performed, and as a result of the uncertainty in the market and adverse impact of COVID-19, Aegon recorded 
impairments primarily in the energy, energy maintenance technologies, and communications sectors (refer to note 15 Impairment 
charges/(reversals) for more details). Allowance for credit losses on consumer loan portfolios and other asset classes remained 
low. In certain cases, customers could defer payments for three to six months. Throughout 2020 there were no significant contract

The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the Group Solvency II ratio as a result of negative market and underwriting impacts.  c
e
Negative market impacts are mainly caused by a sharp decrease in interest rates, compounded by negative credit variances partly 
caused by widening of mortgage spreads. The higher mortality related to COVID-19 in Americas resulted in a negative underwriting 
result partly offset by better results on LTC. As part of its normal process, Aegon has updated its sensitivity analysis for the impact 
of economic and non-economic assumptions on its Solvency II ratio included in the Capital and liquidity management section.
Management's assessment of going concern
The consolidated financial statements of Aegon have been set up assuming a going concern basis of accounting based 
on the reasonable assumption that the Company is, and will be, able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable 
future. Relevant facts and circumstances relating to the consolidated financial position on December 31, 2020, were assessed in order  V
a
to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed are the financial performance, capital adequacy, financial position  lue
 c
and flexibility, liquidity, ability to access capital markets, leverage ratios and the level of cash capital in the holding. Considering  re
a
all these areas management concluded that the going concern assumption for Aegon is appropriate in preparing the consolidated  tio
n
financial statements.
Valuation of assets and liabilities arising from life insurance contracts
The valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts is developed using complex valuation models. The liability 
for life insurance contracts with guaranteed or fixed account terms is either based on current assumptions, on the assumptions 
established at inception of the contract, reflecting the best estimates at the time increased with a margin for adverse deviation, or on 
the valuation assumptions (historical cost), without risk margin. All contracts are subject to liability adequacy testing which reflects  C
management’s current estimates of future cash flows (including investment returns). To the extent that the liability is based on current  rea
t
assumptions, a change in assumptions will have an immediate impact on the income statement. Also, if a change in assumption  in
g
results in not passing the liability adequacy test, the entire deficiency is recognized in the income statement. To the extent that   su
s
the deficiency relates to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, the additional liability is recognized through  ta
in
other comprehensive income in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. ab
le
 v
a
Aegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair  lu
e
value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. Mortgage loans 
is the primary asset class for which the difference between the fair value and the book value of assets impacts the LAT. For details 
on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer to note 44 Fair value.
Some insurance contracts without a guaranteed or fixed contractual term contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Depending 
on the nature of the guarantee, it may either be bifurcated and presented as a derivative, or be reflected in the value of the insurance  F
in
liability in accordance with local accounting principles. Given the dynamic and complex nature of these guarantees, stochastic  an
c
techniques under a variety of market return scenarios are often used for measurement purposes. Such models require management  ia
to make numerous estimates based on historical experience and market expectations. Changes in these estimates will immediately  l inf
o
affect the income statement. rm
a
t
io
n
In addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force are recorded 
as DPAC and VOBA assets respectively, and are amortized to the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future 
profitability of these policies are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated and may require write-offs due 
to unrecoverability.
O
Actuarial and economic assumptions th

Mortality tables applied are generally developed based on a blend of company experience and industry wide studies, taking into  l in

rm
through regular studies, the results of which are fed into the pricing cycle for new products and reflected in the liability calculation  a

when appropriate. For contracts insuring survivorship or mortality, allowance may be made for further longevity or mortality  ion

n n
c Investment assumptions are prescribed by the local regulator, market observable or based on management’s future expectations.  c
e e
In the latter case, the anticipated future investment returns are set by management on a countrywide basis, considering available 
market information and economic indicators. A significant assumption related to estimated gross profits on variable annuities 
and variable life insurance products in the United States and some of the smaller countries, is the annual long-term growth rate 
of the underlying assets. The reconsideration of this assumption may affect the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule, referred 
to as DPAC or VOBA unlocking. The difference between the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule and the revised schedule, 
which is based on actual and estimates of future gross profits, is recognized in the income statement as an expense or a benefit 
in the period of determination.
V Assumptions on future expenses are based on the current level of expenses, adjusted for expected expense inflation if appropriate.  V
a a
lue In Aegon the Netherlands, the expense basis makes an allowance for planned future cost savings, which are included in the liability  lue

t t
io io
n n
Surrender and lapse rates depend on product features, policy duration and external circumstances such as the interest rate 
environment and competitor behavior. For policies with account value guarantees based on equity market movements, a dynamic 
lapse assumption is utilized to reflect policyholder behavior based on whether the guarantee is in the money. Own experience, as well 
as industry published data, are used in establishing assumptions. Lapse experience is correlated to mortality and morbidity levels, 
as higher or lower levels of surrenders may indicate future claims will be higher or lower than anticipated. Such correlations are 
accounted for in the mortality and morbidity assumptions based on the emerging analysis of experience.

lu During 2020, Aegon implemented actuarial assumption and model updates resulting in a net EUR 580 million charge to income before  lu
e e
tax (2019: EUR 196 million charge). This is mainly related to Aegon’s businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption 
changes and model updates in the Americas led to a net negative impact of EUR 805 million. This reflects a charge of EUR 460 million 
related to the lowering the long-term interest rate assumption and the corresponding adjustment of the separate account bond 
return assumptions. During 2020, the long-term interest assumption was assumed to have a grading over 10 years to 2.75%, which 
was a change from the previous assumption during 2018 and 2019 of a grading over 10 years to 4.25%. Non-economic assumption

EUR 108 million (2019: EUR 111 million). The DPAC and VOBA balances for these products in the United States amounted  c
e
to EUR 2.4 billion at December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 2.7 billion).
A relative increase of 10% to the mortality assumption, dependent on product and characteristics of the block of business, would 
reduce net income by approximately EUR 124 million (2019: EUR 204 million). A relative 20% increase in the lapse rate assumption 
would increase net income by approximately EUR 89 million (2019: EUR 126 million).
Any reasonably possible changes in the other assumptions Aegon uses to determine EGP margins (i.e. maintenance expenses) would 
reduce net income by less than EUR 11 million (2019: EUR 13 million).

Sensitivity on liability adequacy test (LAT) in the Netherlands
At December 31, 2020 the liability adequacy test (LAT) of Aegon the Netherlands resulted in a deficiency. The LAT assesses 
the adequacy of the insurance liabilities by comparing them to their fair value. Aegon the Netherlands adjusts the outcome of the LAT 
for certain unrealized gains in the bond portfolio (shadow loss recognition) and certain differences between the fair value and the book 
value of assets measured at amortized cost, mainly residential mortgages. Please also refer to Note 2.19f Liability adequacy testing for  F

The LAT deficit per December 31, 2020 in Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR 7.0 billion (2019: EUR 5.1 billion), which was  l inf

(2019: EUR 1.7 billion). tio
n
During 2020, the LAT deficit of Aegon the Netherlands worsened from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 2.5 billion, which led to the recognition 
of additional insurance contracts liabilities per December 31, 2020 of EUR 0.8 billion. The LAT deficit was negatively impacted 
by the impact of lower interest rate of EUR 1.5 billion (2019: EUR 1.3 billion) and adverse credit spread movements (widening 
mortgage spreads, tightened liquidity premium) of EUR 0.3 billion (2019: EUR 0.8 billion). This was partly offset by other favorable

lu Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy  lu
e e
 c  c
re The following is a description of Aegon’s methods of determining fair value, and a quantification of its exposure to assets and liabilities  re
a a
tio measured at fair value. tio
n n
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the 
measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). A fair value measurement 
assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
	In the principal market for the asset or liability; or 
C 	In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.  C
re re
a a
t t
in Aegon uses the following hierarchy for measuring and disclosing of the fair value of assets and liabilities: in
g g
 su 	Level I: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Aegon can access at the   su
s s
ta measurement date; ta
in in
ab 	Level II: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,  ab
le le
 v as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices of identical or similar assets and liabilities) using valuation techniques for which   v
a a
lu all significant inputs are based on observable market data; and lu
e e
	Level III: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) using valuation 
techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market. In the event that the market for a financial instrument 
is not active or quoted market prices are not available, a valuation technique is used.
F F
in in
an The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally inversely correlates with the level  an
c c
ia of observable valuation inputs. Aegon maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable valuation  ia
l inf inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments, for example, with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing  l inf
o o
rm observability and therefore less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices  rm
a a
tio are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require  tio
n n
more judgment.
The assets and liabilities categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement.
O O
th An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing  th
e e
r n information on an ongoing basis. The judgment as to whether a market is active may include, although not necessarily determinative,  r n
o o
n lower transaction volumes, reduced transaction sizes and, in some cases, no observable trading activity for short periods. In inactive  n

in markets, assurance is obtained that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or it is determined that adjustments  in
a a

ia ia
l in l in
f f
o The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data, and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.  o
rm rm
a However, certain assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market  a
t t
ion inputs that are unobservable and, for such assets and liabilities, the derivation of fair value is more judgmental. An instrument  ion
is classified in its entirety as valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level III) if, in the opinion of management, a significant 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  192
proportion of the instrument’s carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs. 'Unobservable' in this context means that there 
A
is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an at arm’s length transaction would be likely  t a
 g
to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value.  la
n
Additional information is provided in the table headed 'Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonably  c
e
possible alternatives' in note 44 Fair Value. While Aegon believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other 
market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain instruments (both 
financial and non-financial) could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
The valuation techniques applied to financial instrument affected by IBOR reforms remain consistent with those of other market 
participants, and the uncertainty on the outcome of the reforms has not affected the classification of the instruments.
To operationalize Aegon’s fair value hierarchy, individual instruments (both financial and non-financial) are assigned a fair value level 
based primarily on the type of instrument and the source of the prices (e.g. index, third-party pricing service, broker, internally modeled).  V
a
Periodically, this logic for assigning fair value levels is reviewed to determine if any modifications are necessary in the context  lue
 c
of the current market environment. re

4 Financial risks n
General
As an insurance group, Aegon is exposed to a variety of risks. Aegon's largest exposures are to changes in financial markets (e.g. 
foreign currency, interest rate, credit and equity market risks) that affect the value of the investments, liabilities from products that 
Aegon sells, deferred expenses and value of business acquired. Other risks include insurance related risks, such as changes in mortality, 
morbidity, bond credit spread and liquidity premium, which are discussed in note 34 Insurance contracts. Aegon manages risk at local 
level where business is transacted, based on principles and policies established at the Group level. Aegon's integrated approach to risk  C
management involves similar measurement of risk and scope of risk coverage to allow for aggregation of the Group's risk position. rea
t
in
g
To manage its risk exposure, Aegon has risk policies in place. Many of these policies are group-wide while others are specific   su
s
to the unique situation of local businesses. The Group level policies limit the Group's exposure to major risks such as equity,  ta
in
interest rates, credit, and currency. The limits in these policies in aggregate remain within the Group's overall tolerance for risk and  ab
le
the Group's financial resources. Operating within this policy framework, Aegon employs risk management programs including asset   v
a
liability management (ALM) processes and models and hedging programs (which are largely conducted via the use of financial derivative  lu
e
instruments). These risk management programs are in place in each country unit and are not only used to manage risk in each unit, but 
are also part of the Group's overall risk strategy.
Aegon operates a Derivative Use Policy to govern its usage of derivatives. This policy establishes the control, authorization, execution 
and monitoring requirements of the usage of such instruments. In addition, the policy stipulates necessary mitigation of credit risk 
created through derivatives management tools. For derivatives, counterparty credit risk is normally mitigated by requirements to post  F
in
collateral via credit support annex agreements or through a central clearing house. an
c
ia
As part of its risk management programs, Aegon takes inventory of its current risk position across risk categories. Aegon also measures  l inf
o
the sensitivity of net income and shareholders' equity under both deterministic and stochastic scenarios. Management uses the insight  rm
a
gained through these 'what if?' scenarios to manage the Group's risk exposure and capital position. The models, scenarios and  tio
n
assumptions used are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.
Results of Aegon's sensitivity analyses are presented throughout this section to show the estimated sensitivity of net income and 
shareholders' equity to various scenarios. For each type of market risk, the analysis shows how net income and shareholders' equity 
would have been affected by changes in the relevant risk variable that were reasonably possible at the reporting date. For each 
O
sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown. Management action is taken into account  th
e
to the extent that it is part of Aegon's regular policies and procedures, such as established hedging programs. However, incidental  r n
o
management actions that would require a change in policies and procedures are not considered.  n
-
f
in
a
n
Each sensitivity analysis reflects the extent to which the shock tested would affect management's critical accounting estimates and  c
ia
judgment in applying Aegon's accounting policies. Market-consistent assumptions underlying the measurement of non-listed assets  l in
f
and liabilities are adjusted to reflect the shock tested. The shock may also affect the measurement of assets and liabilities based  o
rm
on assumptions that are not observable in the market. For example, a shock in interest rates may lead to changes in the amortization  a
t
schedule of DPAC or to increased impairment losses on equity investments. Although management's short-term assumptions may  ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
192 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  193
change if there is a reasonably possible change in a risk factor, long-term assumptions will generally not be revised unless there 
A A
t a is evidence that the movement is permanent. This fact is reflected in the sensitivity analyses. t a
 g  g
la la
n n
c The accounting mismatch inherent in IFRS-EU is also apparent in the reported sensitivities. A change in interest rates has an immediate  c
e e
impact on the carrying amount of assets measured at fair value. However, the shock will not have a similar effect on the carrying 
amount of the related insurance liabilities that are measured based on locked-in assumptions or on management's long-term 
expectations. Consequently, the different measurement bases for assets and liabilities lead to increased volatility in IFRS-EU net 
income and shareholders' equity. Aegon has classified a significant part of its investment portfolio as 'available-for-sale', which 
is one of the main reasons why the economic shocks tested have a different impact on net income than on shareholders' equity. 
Unrealized gains and losses on these assets are not recognized in the income statement but are booked through other comprehensive 
income to the revaluation reserves in shareholders' equity, unless impaired. As a result, economic sensitivities predominantly impact 
shareholders' equity but leave net income unaffected. The effect of movements of the revaluation reserve on capitalization ratios and 
V capital adequacy are minimal. Aegon's target ratio for the composition of its capital base is based on shareholders' equity excluding  V
a a
lue the revaluation reserve. lue
 c  c
re re
a a
tio The sensitivities do not reflect what the net income for the period would have been if risk variables had been different because  tio
n n
the analysis is based on the exposures in existence at the reporting date rather than on those that actually occurred during the year. 
Nor are the results of the sensitivities intended to be an accurate prediction of Aegon's future shareholders' equity or earnings. 
The analysis does not take into account the impact of future new business, which is an important component of Aegon's future 
earnings. It also does not consider all methods available to management to respond to changes in the financial environment, such 
as changing investment portfolio allocations or adjusting premiums and crediting rates. Furthermore, the results of the analyses cannot 
be extrapolated for wider variations since effects do not tend to be linear.

alu 	Concentration per sector, geography and asset class: Aegon’s investment strategy is translated in investment mandates for its  alu
e e
internal and external asset managers. Through these investment mandates limits on sector, geography and asset class are set. 
Compliance monitoring of the investment mandates is done by the insurance operating companies.
Moreover, concentration of financial risks are measured in Aegon business planning cycle. As part of business planning, the resilience 
of Aegon's business strategy is tested in several extreme event scenarios. In the Adverse Financial scenario, financial markets are 
F stressed without assuming diversification across different market factors. Within the projection certain management actions may  F

Money market and short-term investments
A A
t a The collateral reported for the money market and short-term investments are related to tri-party repurchase agreements (repos).  t a
 g  g
la Within tri-party repos Aegon invests under short-term reverse repurchase agreements and the counterparty posts collateral to a third  la
n n
c party custodian. The collateral posted is typically high-quality, short-term securities and is only accessible for or available to Aegon  c
e e
in the event the counterparty defaults.
Mortgage loans
The real estate collateral for mortgages includes both residential and commercial properties. The collateral for commercial mortgage 
loans in Aegon Americas is measured at fair value. At a minimum on an annual basis, a fair value is estimated for each individual real 
estate property that has been pledged as collateral. When a loan is originally provided, an external appraisal is obtained to estimate 
the value of the property. In subsequent years, the value is typically estimated internally using various professionally accepted valuation 
methodologies. Internal appraisals are performed by qualified, professionally accredited personnel. International valuation standards 
V are used and the most significant assumptions made during the valuation of real estate are the current cost of reproducing or replacing  V
a a
lue the property, the value that the property's net earning power will support, and the value indicated by recent sales of comparable  lue
 c  c
re properties. Valuations are primarily supported by market evidence. For Aegon the Netherlands, collateral for the residential mortgages  re
a a
tio is measured as the foreclosure value which is indexed periodically.  tio
n n
Cash collateral for mortgage loans includes the savings that have been received to redeem the underlying mortgage loans 
at redemption date. These savings are part of the credit side of the statement of financial position, but reduce the credit risk for 
the mortgage loan as a whole. 
A substantial part of Aegon's Dutch residential mortgage loan portfolio benefits from guarantees by a Dutch government-backed 
C trust (Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woning) through the Dutch Mortgage loan Guarantee program (NHG). With exception of NHG- C
rea backed mortgage loans originated after January 1, 2014, for which a 10% lender-incurred haircut applies on realized losses on each  rea
t t
in defaulted loan, these guarantees cover all principal losses, missed interest payments and foreclosure costs incurred upon termination  in
g g
 su and settlement of defaulted mortgage loans when lender-specific terms and conditions of the guarantee are met. When not fully   su
s s
ta met, the trust may pay claims in part or in full, depending on the severity of the breach of terms and conditions. For each specific loan,  ta
in in
ab the guarantee amortizes in line with an equivalent annuity mortgage loan. When the remaining loan balance at default does not exceed  ab
le le
 v the amortized guarantee, it covers the full loss under its terms and conditions. Any loan balance in excess of this decreasing guarantee   v
a a
lu profile serves as a first loss position for the lender.  lu
e e
Derivatives
The master netting agreements column in the table relates to derivative liability positions which are used in Aegon's credit risk 
management. The offset in the master netting agreements column includes balances where there is a legally enforceable right 
of offset, but no intention to settle these balances on a net basis under normal circumstances. As a result, there is a net exposure for 
F credit risk management purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis, they do not qualify for net  F

a a
tio The assets in trust can be accessed to pay policyholder benefits in the event the reinsurers fail to perform under the terms of their  tio
n n
contract. Further information on the related reinsurance transactions is included in note 26 Reinsurance assets. 
Other loans

a mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into credit support agreement, where practical, and in ISDA master netting  a

ion agreements for most of Aegon's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. Main counterparties to these  ion
transactions are investment banks which are typically rated 'A' or higher. The credit support agreement will normally dictate 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  196
the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aegon or its counterparty. Transactions requiring Aegon or its counterparty 
A
to post collateral are typically the result of derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, equity swaps, currency swaps  t a
 g
and credit swaps. Collateral received is mainly cash (USD and EUR). The credit support agreements that outline the acceptable  la
n
collateral require high-quality instruments to be posted. Over the last three years, there was no default with any derivatives  c
e
counterparty. The credit risk associated with financial assets subject to a master netting agreement is eliminated only to the extent 
that financial liabilities due to the same counterparty will be settled after the assets are realized. Eligible derivative transactions are 
traded via Central Clearing Houses as required by EMIR and the Dodd-Frank act. Credit risk in these transactions is mitigated through 
posting of initial and variation margins.
Aegon may also mitigate credit risk in reinsurance contracts by including downgrade clauses that allow the recapture of business, 
retaining ownership of assets required to support liabilities ceded or by requiring the reinsurer to hold assets in trust. For the resulting 
net credit risk exposure, Aegon employs deterministic and stochastic credit risk modeling in order to assess the Group's credit risk 
profile, associated earnings and capital implications due to various credit loss scenarios. V
a
lu
e
 c
Aegon operates a Credit Name Limit Policy (CNLP) under which limits are placed on the aggregate exposure that it has to any one  re
a
counterparty. Limits are placed on the exposure at both group level and individual country units. The limits also vary by a rating system,  tio
n
which is a composite of the main rating agencies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch) and Aegon's internal rating of the counterparty. If an 
exposure exceeds the stated limit, then the exposure must be reduced to the limit for the country unit and rating category as soon 
as possible. Exceptions to these limits can only be made after explicit approval from Aegon's Group Risk and Capital Committee (GRCC). 
The policy is reviewed regularly.
At December 31, 2020, there was one violation of the Credit Name Limit Policy at Group level (2019: two). This related to the Republic 
of Turkey and is being closely monitored. The breach will be resolved by the disposal of Aegon Turkey, which is expected to close  C
in the course of 2021. rea

At December 31, 2020, Aegon's largest corporate credit exposures are to Wilton Re Holdings Ltd, American United Mutual   su
s
Insurance, SCOR and Reinsurance Group of America and Munich Re. Aegon had large government exposures, the largest being  ta
in
in the Americas, the Netherlands and Germany. Highly rated government bonds and government exposure domestically issued and  ab

owned in local currency are excluded from the Credit Name Limit Policy.  v

 v 2020 was a tale of two regimes: fear and contraction followed by optimism and growth. Both the economy and markets fell   v
a a
lu precipitously in the first quarter with the global spread of COVID-19. In the US, Stay-at-home orders started in mid-March and auto  lu
e e
production ceased at the same time. Furthermore, in markets the Federal Reserve (FED) eased the Federal Funds Target Rate by 100 
bps, the U.S. 10-year treasury rate fell 120 bps to 70 bps, oil prices dropped from $70 a barrel to $20, the S&P 500 fell 34% and 
credit spreads widened. In the economy, nonfarm payrolls fell by 22 million jobs or 14% in the first couple of months of 2020, while 
nominal GDP contracted by 10% in the first half of 2020.
F Around the end of April markets and the economy began to turn. This was fueled by optimism that by following safety procedures  F
in in
an outlined by epidemiologists the economy would normalize. The US started easing stay-at-home orders and businesses began  an
c c
ia reopening. Ford and GM resumed Auto production in mid-May. The result was that by June the S&P 500 was down only 8%, corporate  ia
l inf bond spreads, which had widened from 125 to 366, had tightened back to 175 and employment had increased by 8 million jobs  l inf
o o
rm since earlier in the year. As the summer progressed, optimism grew that vaccines would be available as early as the US presidential  rm
a a
tio election and life would become close to normal in the second half of 2020. As summer turned to fall, however, the recovery slowed  tio
n n
with certain sectors recovering while others struggled. Although durable and non-durable goods consumption exceeded pre-pandemic 
levels by the third quarter, service related consumption lagged. Durables were up 13% and non-durables 4% while the larger services 
segment contracted by 8%. This reflected the ongoing pressure on businesses in dining, travel, leisure, and retail. Capital investment 
was also still down for the year by the end of the third quarter.

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  204
By November 2020 the S&P 500 was up 14% for the corporate bond spreads at 117 are tighter than in February, oil was over 
A
$50 a barrel and in total 13 million jobs were added from the employment low. In the second half of December, a second wave  t a
 g
of COVID-19 virus infection was sweeping Europe and the US, and the economy started to slow as lockdowns were reinstituted in many  la
n
locations. Some vaccines were approved, people were being inoculated and the US congress approved USD 900 million of fiscal  c
e
stimulus to hopefully bridge the gap to normalization. Although the next six months is expected to be difficult, the market expects 
strong earnings and GDP growth in the second half of 2021. The market also expects to see the FED on hold for several years, due 
to low inflation concerns, long-term economic damage and full recovery in employment and aggregate consumer demand. Rates are 
priced to remain low and inflation subdued. 
The European economy contracted sharply during 2020. The lockdowns implemented in the first half of the year led to an 
unprecedented large fall in GDP. Activity did rebound sharply in summer when restrictions were, for a large part, lifted. However, a sharp 
rise in COVID-19 infections in the autumn again led to lockdowns and restrictions being implemented. These were less detrimental 
compared to those in the first half, but nonetheless resulted in a second fall in output.  V
a
lu
e
 c
Governments intervened to limit the economic fallout. Fiscal authorities implemented employment and business support schemes, such  re
a
that sectors most impacted would suffer less permanent damage. This resulted in large deficits and another jump in government debt  tio
n
levels. The ECB ensured a proper functioning financial market by implementing a new QE program, which was several times enlarged 
during the year. At the same time, the introduction of Pandemic Emergency Long Term Refinancing Operations (PELTRO) provided 
commercial banks with sufficient liquidity at favorable rates, to support the bank lending channel. The European Union eventually 
approved the formation of a EUR 750bln “recovery fund” after disagreements about the size and the conditionalities attached. This 
was perceived positively by financial markets as it reduces the risk of European disintegration and supports countries most impacted.
Since January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. Just before the Brexit transition period  C
ended after December 31, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed on a new “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”  rea
t
outlining their post-Brexit relationship. in

Impairment of financial assets ta
in
Aegon regularly monitors industry sectors and individual debt securities for indicators of impairment. These indicators may include one  ab
le
or more of the following: 1) deteriorating market to book ratio, 2) increasing industry risk factors, 3) deteriorating financial condition   v
a
of the issuer, 4) covenant violations by the issuer, 5) high probability of bankruptcy of the issuer, or 6) downgrades by internationally  lu
e
recognized credit rating agency. Additionally, for asset-backed securities, cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral are 
monitored. A security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset 
that has a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows.
In the sections below a description is provided on the composition of the categories of debt securities and money market investments. 
Individual issuers rated below investment grade in any sector which have unrealized loss positions greater than EUR 25 million are  F
in
disclosed separately. Furthermore, quality ratings of investment portfolios are based on a composite of the main rating agencies  an
c
(S&P and Moody's) and Aegon's internal rating of the counterparty. ia

A significant part of Aegon Americas RMBS holdings are rated below BBB, as the issuance took place before the United States housing 
downturn that started in 2007.
Additionally, Aegon Americas has investments in RMBS of EUR 69 million (2019: EUR 67 million), which are classified as fair value 
through profit or loss.
F F
in in
an RMBS of Aegon Americas are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. Detailed cash flow models using the current collateral  an
c c
ia pool and capital structure on the portfolio are updated and reviewed quarterly. Model output is generated under base and stress- ia
l inf case scenarios. Aegon's RMBS asset specialists utilize widely recognized industry modeling software to perform a loan-by-loan,  l inf
o o
rm bottom-up approach to modeling. Key assumptions used in the models are projected defaults, loss severities, and prepayments. Each  rm
a a
tio of these key assumptions varies greatly based on the significantly diverse characteristics of the current collateral pool for each security.  tio
n n
Loan-to-value, loan size, and borrower credit history are some of the key characteristics used to determine the level of assumption that 
is utilized. Defaults were estimated by identifying the loans that are in various delinquency buckets and defaulting a certain percentage 
of them over the near-term and long-term. Assumed defaults on delinquent loans are dependent on the specific security's collateral 
attributes and historical performance.
O O
th Prepayments and loss severity assumptions were determined by obtaining historical rates from broader market data and by adjusting  th
e e
r n those rates for vintage, specific pool performance, collateral type, mortgage insurance and estimated loan modifications. Prepayments  r n
o o
n were estimated by examining historical averages of prepayment activity on the underlying collateral. Quantitative ranges of significant  n
- -
f f
in assumptions within Aegon’s modeling process for Prime Jumbo, Alt-A, Negative Amortization and subprime RMBS are as follows:  in
a a
n n
c prepayment assumptions range from approximately 0% to 73% with a weighted average of approximately 10% (2019: 8%),  c
ia ia
l in the increase compared to prior year is related to a change in the model from using 'delinquent' loans to using 'defaulted' loans.  l in
f f
o Assumed loan defaults range from 0% to 39% with a weighted average of approximately 20% (2019: 20%) and are dependent  o
rm rm
a on the specific security's collateral attributes and historical performance, while loss severity assumptions range from approximately  a
t t
ion -150% to 105%, with a weighted average of approximately 49% (2019: 50%). ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  206
Once the entire pool is modeled, the results are closely analyzed by Aegon's asset specialists to determine whether or not 
A
Aegon's particular tranche or holding is at risk for not collecting all contractual cash flows taking into account the seniority and other  t a
 g
terms of the tranches held. la
n
c
e
Aegon the Netherlands has mandated Aegon Asset Management to invest in RMBS transactions. Aegon Asset Management uses its 
own proprietary cash flow tools to analyze and stress test RMBS transactions. The key input parameters are default rates and loss 
given default assumptions, which are established based on historical pool characteristics and current loan level data. Cash flows for 
each bond are modelled in 225 scenarios of varying severity, ranging from our base case to extreme stress to even unrealistic scenarios 
to establish breaking points of the tranche. The model takes all deal characteristics, such as waterfall or reserve funds, into account 
and gives us detailed insight in the risk of principal loss or deferral of contractual cash flows.
The total gross unrealized loss on available-for-sale RMBS of Aegon Americas and Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR 17 million 
(2019: EUR 18 million), of which EUR 17 million (2019: EUR 18 million) relates to positions of Aegon Americas. The total  V
a
net unrealized gain on available-for-sale RMBS was EUR 232 million (2019: EUR 288 million), including a EUR 228 million  lue
 c
(2019: EUR 284 million) net unrealized gain relating to positions of Aegon Americas. re
a
t
io
n
The United States’ non-agency RMBS saw significant spread widening across deal types during the first quarter of 2020 primarily 
driven by pandemic-induced economic contraction, broad market volatility and mortgage Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) 
liquidations. Spreads have tightened substantially to near pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2020, facilitated by unprecedented 
monetary and fiscal stimulus. Government fiscal stimulus, temporary loan forbearance programs and accumulated home equity have 
moderated collateral performance deterioration. Approximately 40% of COVID-19 related delinquencies have cured and another round 
of government assistance as well as enhanced unemployment benefits should further support recovery in the mortgage market. 
C
In general, the European housing market was strong at the start of the year against solid economic fundamentals. The shutdowns that  rea
t
followed the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a sharp negative impact on these economic fundamentals. Most financial assets  in
g
weakened considerably in March, after which an improvement followed. This also holds for asset backed securities. Spreads on these   su
s
assets rose significantly in March, after which a gradual spread normalization followed. This recovery was helped by the ECB which  ta
in
increased its asset purchase program, including ABS. This means that spreads have fallen from their March peaks, but spreads are still  ab
le
slightly higher than at the beginning of 2020, leading to a marginally positive total return over 2020.  v

The COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate impact on commercial real estate and the CMBS sector, especially in the hospitality and  in
a
n
retail segments where shelter-in-place orders had a profound impact on property cash flows. CMBS hospitality and retail delinquency  c
ia
rates experienced a dramatic increase in the second quarter; however, have found stabilization and improvement in the second  l in
f
half of 2020 driven by debt service relief and the reopening of the economy. Despite forced selling and uncertainty driving spread  o
rm
volatility at the onset of the crisis, CMBS spreads in the senior part of the capital structure have retraced and found support. Although  a
t
subordinated and lower quality spreads have also retraced some of their widening, they remain wide from a historical perspective due  ion
to credit uncertainty and elevated risk of ratings migration.

re CMBS of Aegon Americas are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. Detailed cash flow models using the current collateral  re
a a
tio pool and capital structure on the portfolio are updated and reviewed quarterly. Model output is generated under base and several  tio
n n
stress-case scenarios by Aegon's internal CMBS asset specialists. For conduit securities, a widely recognized industry modeling 
software is used to perform a loan-by-loan, bottom-up approach. For non-conduit securities, CMBS asset specialists works closely 
with Aegon's real estate valuation group to determine underlying asset valuation and risk. Both methodologies incorporate external 
estimates on the property market, capital markets, property cash flows, and loan structure. Results are then closely analyzed 
by the asset specialist to determine whether or not a principal or interest loss is expected to occur.

In the United States, spreads of asset-backed securities widened in March and April upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic

rm rm
a in spreads across all ABS sectors in line with the strong sentiment in the broader financial markets. The strong sentiment was  a
t t
ion supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary support, slowly re-opening of the economy and the abating fear of a second wave  ion

Net (impairments) and recoveries
Net impairments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, totaled EUR 130 million (2019: EUR 17 million net recoveries).
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, Aegon recognized impairments of EUR 156 million (2019: EUR 49 million) mostly 
related to impairments on public fixed income holdings.
C For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, Aegon recognized EUR 26 million (2019: EUR 66 million) in recoveries on previously  C
rea impaired securities. In each case where a recovery was taken on structured securities, improvements in underlying cash flows for  rea
t t
in the security were documented and modeling results improved significantly. Recoveries on non-structured securities were supported  in

le le
 v The tables that follow provide information on past due and individually impaired financial assets for the whole Aegon Group. An asset   v
a a
lu is past due when a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due. Assets are impaired when an impairment loss  lu
e e
has been charged to the income statement relating to this asset. After the impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods, the asset 
is no longer considered to be impaired. When the terms and conditions of financial assets have been renegotiated, the terms and 
conditions of the new agreement apply in determining whether the financial assets are past due.
Aegon's policy is to pursue realization of the collateral in an orderly manner as and when liquidity permits. Aegon generally does not

Equity instruments classified as available-for-sale
A
Objective evidence of impairment of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale includes information  t a
 g
about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment  la
n
in which the issuer operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity instrument may not be recovered. A significant  c
e
or prolonged decline in the fair value of an investment in an equity instrument below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment. 
Significant or prolonged decline is generally defined within Aegon as an unrealized loss position for more than six months or a fair 
value of less than 80% of the cost price of the investment. Additionally, as part of an ongoing process, internal equity analysts actively 
monitor earnings releases, company fundamentals, new developments and industry trends for any signs of possible impairment.
These factors typically require significant management judgment. The impairment review process has resulted in EUR 21 million 
of impairment charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 7 million) for Aegon Americas and Aegon 
the Netherlands.
V
a
As of December 31, 2020, there are EUR 58 million of gross unrealized gains and EUR 14 million of gross unrealized losses  lue

Fluctuations in the equity, real estate and capital markets have affected Aegon's profitability, capital position and sales of equity  n

f
related products in the past and may continue to do so. Exposure to equity, real estate and capital markets exists in both assets  in
a
n
and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment, where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility in returns and  c
ia
investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in insurance and investment contracts for policyholders where  l in
f
funds are invested in equities, backing variable annuities, unit-linked products and mutual funds. Although most of the risk remains  o
rm
with the policyholder, lower investment returns can reduce the asset management fee earned by Aegon on the asset balance in these  a
t
products. In addition, some of this business has minimum return or accumulation guarantees.  ion

The sensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders' equity to changes in equity prices is presented in the table below. 
The sensitivity of shareholders' equity and net income to changes in equity markets reflects changes in the market value 
of Aegon's portfolio, changes in DPAC amortization, contributions to pension plans for Aegon's employees and the strengthening 
of the guaranteed minimum benefits, when applicable. Aegon generally has positive income benefits from equity market increases and 
negative impacts from equity market declines as it earns fees on policyholder account balances and provides minimum guarantees for  V
a
account values. Aegon uses options and other equity derivatives to provide protection against the negative impact of equity market  lue
 c
declines. Net income and shareholders' equity in 2020 are generally less sensitive compared to 2019 mainly reflecting the new  re
a

Interest rate risk
Aegon bears interest rate risk with many of its products. In cases where cash flows are highly predictable, investing in assets that 
closely match the cash flow profile of the liabilities can offset this risk. For some Aegon country units, local capital markets are not  F
in
well developed, which prevents the complete matching of assets and liabilities for those businesses. For some products, cash flows are  an
c
less predictable as a result of policyholder actions that can be affected by the level of interest rates. ia
l in
f
o
In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase. Premiums in flexible premium  rm
a
policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This activity may result in cash payments  tio
n
by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase 
in market interest rates; this may result in realized investment losses. These cash payments to policyholders result in a decrease 
in total invested assets and a decrease in net income. Among other things, early withdrawals may also require accelerated amortization 
of DPAC, which in turn reduces net income.
O
During periods of sustained low interest rates, Aegon may not be able to preserve margins as a result of minimum interest rate  th
e
guarantees and minimum guaranteed crediting rates provided on policies. Also, investment earnings may be lower because the interest  r n
o
earnings on new fixed-income investments are likely to have declined with the market interest rates. Mortgage loans and redeemable  n
-
f
bonds in the investment portfolio are more likely to be repaid as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates and Aegon may  in
a
n
be required to reinvest the proceeds in securities bearing lower interest rates. Accordingly, net income declines as a result of a  c
ia
decrease in the spread between returns on the investment portfolio and the interest rates either credited to policyholders or assumed  l in
f
in reserves. o
rm
a
t
Aegon manages interest rate risk closely, taking into account all of the complexity regarding policyholder behavior and management  ion
action. Aegon employs sophisticated interest rate measurement techniques and actively uses derivatives and other risk mitigation tools 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
214 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  215
to closely manage its interest rate risk exposure. Aegon operates an Investment & Counterparty Risk policy that limits the amount 
A A
t a of interest rate risk to which the Group is exposed. All derivative use is governed by Aegon's Derivative Use Policy. A detailed description  t a
 g  g

lue shareholders' equity arising from the impact on general account investments and offset due to liabilities from insurance and investment  lue

re contracts. Timing and valuation differences between assets and liabilities may cause short-term reductions in net income as rates rise.  re
a a
tio Rising interest rates would also cause the fair value of the available-for-sale bond portfolio to decline and the level of unrealized gains  tio
n n
could become too low to support recoverability of the full deferred tax asset triggering an allowance charge to income. The offsetting 
economic gain on the insurance and investment contracts is however not fully reflected in the sensitivities because many of these 
liabilities are not measured at fair value. The short to medium term reduction in net income due to rising interest rates would 
be offset by higher net income in later years, all else being equal. Therefore, higher interest rates are not considered a long-
term risk to the Group. However, a long sustained period of low interest rates will erode net income due to lower returns earned 
on reinvestments and due to lower long term returns from decreased overall portfolio yields.

o o
rm Currency exchange rate risk rm
a a
tio As an international group, Aegon is subject to foreign currency translation risk. Foreign currency exposure exists mainly when  tio
n n
policies are denominated in currencies other than the issuer's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing 
insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local 
currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, 
currency exchange rate fluctuations will affect the level of shareholders' equity as a result of translation of subsidiaries into euro, 
the Group's presentation currency. Aegon holds the remainder of its capital base (perpetual capital securities, subordinated and senior 
O O
th debt) in various currencies in amounts that are targeted to correspond to the book value of the country units. This balancing mitigates  th
e e
r n currency translation impacts on shareholders' equity and leverage ratios. Aegon does not hedge the income streams from the main  r n
o o
n non-euro units and, as a result, earnings may fluctuate due to currency translation. As Aegon has significant business segments  n
- -
f f
in in the Americas and in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences  in
a a
n n
c between the US dollar and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro. Aegon may experience significant changes in net income  c
ia ia
l in and shareholders' equity because of these fluctuations. l in
f f
o o

a Aegon operates an Investment & Counterparty Risk Policy which applies currency risk exposure limits both at Group and regional  a
t t
ion levels, and under which direct currency speculation or program trading by country units is not allowed unless explicit approval has  ion
been granted by the Group Risk and Capital Committee and the Management Board. Assets should be held in the functional currency

Liquidity risk n
-
f
Liquidity risk is inherent in much of Aegon's business. Each asset purchased and liability incurred has its own liquidity characteristics.  in
a
n
Some liabilities are surrenderable while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, real estate and limited partnership  c
ia
interests, have low liquidity. If Aegon requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements and  l in
f
existing credit facilities, it may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices or in a timely manner. Liquidity risk is also  o
rm
affected by the use of collateralized financial derivatives to mitigate other risks. a
t
io
n
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
216 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 4  217
Aegon operates a Liquidity Risk Policy under which country units are obliged to maintain sufficient levels of highly liquid assets 
A A
t a to meet cash demands by policyholders and account holders over the next two years. Potential cash demands are assessed under  t a
 g  g
la a stress scenario including spikes in disintermediation risk due to rising interest rates and concerns over Aegon's financial strength due  la
n n
c to multiple downgrades of the Group's credit rating. At the same time, the liquidity of assets other than cash and government issues  c
e e
is assumed to be severely impaired for an extended period of time. All legal entities and Aegon Group must maintain enough liquidity 
in order to meet all cash needs under this extreme scenario.
Aegon held EUR 33,465 million of general account investments in cash, money market products and government bonds that are readily 
saleable or redeemable on demand (2019: EUR 31,066 million). The Group expects to meet its obligations, even in a stressed liquidity 
event, from operating cash flows and the proceeds of maturing assets as well as these highly liquid assets. Further, the Group has 
access to back-up credit facilities, as disclosed in note 37 Borrowings, amounting to EUR 3,288 million which were unused at the end 
of the reporting period (2019: EUR 3,403 million).
V V
a a
lue The maturity analysis below shows the remaining contractual maturities of each category of financial liabilities (including coupon  lue
 c  c
re interest). When the counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is included on the basis of the earliest date  re
a a
tio on which it can be required to be paid. Financial liabilities that can be required to be paid on demand without any delay are reported  tio
n n
in the category 'On demand.' If there is a notice period, it has been assumed that notice is given immediately and the repayment has 
been presented at the earliest date after the end of the notice period. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount reported 
is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes 
in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the reporting date.
To manage the liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, Aegon holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents and 
C investment grade investment securities for which there is an active and liquid market. These assets can be readily sold to meet  C
rea liquidity requirements. For this reason, Aegon believes that it is not necessary to disclose a maturity analysis in respect of these assets  rea
t t
in to enable users to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk. in

c business, asset management or services related to these activities. The reportable segments are: c
e e
	Americas: one operating segment which covers business units in the United States and Brazil, including any of the units’ activities 
located outside these countries;
	The Netherlands: which covers businesses activities from Aegon the Netherlands;
	United Kingdom: which covers businesses activities from Existing Business and Digital Solutions;
	International: one operating segment which covers businesses operating in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, Hungary, 
Poland, Turkey, Romania, Spain and Portugal including any of the units’ activities located outside these countries;
	Asset Management: one operating segment which covers business activities from AAM Global Platforms, Strategic Partnerships 
and Other;

Change in operating segments
Aegon has changed the grouping of the operating segments included in the performance measure as of 2020. As per January 1, 2020 
activities in Southern and Eastern Europe and Asia have been brought together in a new operating segment, International. 
The change in segment reporting does not have an impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Aegon. 
C The tables presented in this document have been updated to reflect this change. C

in Performance Measure in
g g
 su Aegon uses the non-IFRS-EU performance measure underlying earnings before tax. Underlying earnings before tax reflects   su
s s
ta Aegon’s profit from underlying business operations and mainly excludes components that relate to accounting mismatches that are  ta
in in
ab dependent on market volatility, updates to best estimate actuarial and economic assumptions and model updates or events that are  ab
le le
 v considered outside the normal course of business. There is no standardized meaning to these measures under IFRS-EU or any other   v
a a
lu recognized set of accounting standards. lu
e e
Aegon believes that its performance measure underlying earnings before tax provides meaningful information about the underlying 
results of Aegon’s business, including insight into the financial measures that Aegon’s senior management uses in managing 
the business. Among other things, Aegon’s senior management is compensated based in part on Aegon’s results against targets 
using underlying earnings before tax. While many other insurers in Aegon’s peer group present substantially similar performance 
F measures, the performance measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the performance measures presented  F
in in
an by other insurers.  an

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 5  220
Certain assets held by Aegon are carried at fair value and managed on a total return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation 
A
of related liabilities. These include assets such as investments in hedge funds, private equities, real estate (limited partnerships),  t a
 g
convertible bonds and structured products. Underlying earnings before tax exclude any over- or underperformance compared  la
n
to management’s best estimate investment return on assets. Based on current holdings and asset returns, the long-term expected  c
e
return on an annual basis is 3-10%, depending on asset class, including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings 
from these asset classes are net of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where applicable.
In addition, certain products offered by Aegon Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a fair value basis and include the total 
return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets 
and risk-free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings. 
The fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees 
of Aegon's businesses in the Netherlands and Japan are excluded from underlying earnings before tax, because management's best  V
a
estimate expected return for these guarantees is set at zero. In addition, fair value items include market related results on the loyalty  lue
 c

Holding and other activities include certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The interest rate risk 
on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The fair value movement resulting from changes in Aegon’s credit spread used in the valuation 
of these bonds are excluded from underlying earnings before tax and reported under fair value items. 
Realized gains or losses on investments
Realized gains or losses on investments includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, mortgage loans and other  C
loan portfolios. rea
t
in
g
Impairment charges/(reversals)  su
s
Impairment charges/(reversals) include impairments on available-for-sale debt securities, shares including the effect of deferred  ta
in
policyholder acquisition costs, mortgage loans and other loan portfolios at amortized cost, joint ventures and associates. Impairment  ab
le
reversals include reversals on available-for-sale debt securities. For Aegon the Netherlands, the expected impairments on alternative   v
a
assets classes (e.g. illiquid investments – including consumer loans and catastrophe bonds – and residential real estate) are allocated  lu
e
to underlying earnings in order to present management's best estimate investment return in underlying earnings. Deviations from 
the expected impairments are presented as part of impairment charges / (reversals) in non-underlying earnings.
Other income or charges
Other income or charges includes the following:
	Items which cannot be directly allocated to a specific line of business; F
in
	The impact of actuarial and economic assumption and model updates used to support calculations of our liabilities for insurance  an
c
and investment contracts sold to policyholders and related assets (refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgement  ia
in applying accounting policies); and l inf
o
	Items that are outside the normal course of business, including restructuring charges. rm

n
In the Consolidated income statement, the restructuring charges are included in operating expenses. Actuarial assumption and model 
updates are recorded in 'Policyholder claims and benefits' in the Consolidated income statement.
Run-off businesses
Run-off businesses include results of business units where management in earlier years has decided to exit the market and to run-
O
off the existing block of business. This line only includes results related to the run-off of the remaining institutional spread-based  th
e
business, structured settlements blocks of business, the life reinsurance business and the bank-owned and corporate-owned life  r n
o
insurance (BOLI/COLI) business in the United States. Aegon has other blocks of business for which sales have been discontinued and  n
-
f
of which the earnings are included in underlying earnings before tax. The size of these remaining blocks is small and in 2021 this  in
a

Other charges amounted to EUR 1,239 million in 2020, driven by the Americas. The Americas recorded other charges 
of EUR 1,110 million in 2020 mainly due to unfavorable impacts from model and assumption changes. In addition, the Americas 
incurred other charges due to a valuation allowance related to the ongoing rehabilitation process of a reinsurer, the restructuring 
of captives, and a provision for a settlement of class action litigation related to monthly deduction rate adjustments on certain

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 5  224
The Group uses underlying earnings before tax in its segment reporting as an important indicator of its financial performance. The 
A
reconciliation from underlying earnings before tax to income before tax, being the most comparable IFRS-EU measure, is presented in  t a
 g
the table below. For those items that cannot be directly reconciled to the respective notes, the explanation is provided below the table.  la
n
Aegon believes that underlying earnings before tax, together with the other information included in this report, provides a meaningful  c
e
measure for the investing public to evaluate Aegon’s business relative to the businesses of its peers.

Impact from assumption and model updates
The 2020 assumption changes and model updates amounted to a negative impact of EUR 580 million and mainly relates 
to Aegon’s businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a net 
negative impact of EUR 805 million. This reflects a charge of EUR 460 million related to the lowering the long-term interest rate 
assumption from 4.25% to 2.75% and the corresponding adjustment of the separate account bond return assumptions. Non-economic 
assumption changes resulted in a charge of EUR 345 million, mainly related to Universal Life premium persistency and an increase 
V in mortality rate assumptions, as well as lowering the morbidity improvement assumption for Long-Term Care from 1.5% to 0.75% per  V
a a
lue year for the next 15 years. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to a favorable impact of EUR 225 million  lue
 c  c
re mainly related to favorable longevity assumption changes, partially offset by adverse impacts from mortgage prepayment model and  re
a a
tio expense assumption updates.  tio
n n
The 2019 assumption changes and model updates amounted to a negative impact of EUR 196 million and mainly relates 
to Aegon’s businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a net 
negative impact of EUR 64 million mainly driven by updates to Universal Life products for surrender, lapse and mortality to reflect 
actual experience, partially offset by gains driven by updates to the annuitization of Variable Deferred Annuities Guaranteed Minimum 
Income Benefit and to the returns on Equity-Index Universal Life. In the second half of 2019, a negative impact of EUR 75 million 
C resulted mostly from expenses assumption updates in the Americas. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led  C
rea to negative impact of EUR 57 million mainly related to model enhancements and expense assumption updates which more than offset  rea

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 14 234
Long Term Incentive Plans 
A
Selected senior employees within Aegon, who have not been classified as ‘Material Risk Takers’, can be granted the conditional  t a
 g
right to receive Aegon shares at the start of a performance year. The grant price for these shares is equal to the volume weighted  la
n
average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding a plan year  c
e
and January 15 of a plan year. The actual allocation of these shares to eligible employees depends on Aegon Group performance, 
the employee’s unit performance and individual performance on predefined financial and non-financial performance indicators and 
targets, as well as the continued employment of the employee.  
 
Once allocated, the shares are deferred and cliff-vest two years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been 
adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend 
during the deferral period. In specific circumstances Aegon's Supervisory Board can reclaim variable compensation that has already 
been allocated (but still unvested) or vested (claw back).

Variable Compensation Material Risk Takers lu
e
 c
Members of the Executive Board and the Management Board as well as other senior employees are classified as 'Material Risk Takers'  re
a
in accordance with the Solvency II Legal Framework (up to 2018 these employees were classified as ‘Identified Staff’ in accordance  tio
n
with Capital Requirements Directives). In line with these rules, variable compensation for Material Risk Takers is partially paid out 
directly after allocation in cash and partly in Aegon shares. These shares are deferred and cliff-vest three years after allocation 
as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral 
year. The shares are conditionally granted at the start of the performance year. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume 
weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding 
a plan year and January 15 of the plan year. The actual allocation of these shares to eligible employees depends on Aegon Group 
performance, the employee’s unit performance and individual performance against predefined financial and non-financial performance  C
indicators and targets, as well as the continued employment of the employee.  rea
t
  in
g
Before allocation and vesting, the Supervisory Board can decide to adjust an award downwards based on the annual ex-ante and ex-  su
s
post risk assessments respectively, which takes into account significant and exceptional circumstances which were not (sufficiently)  ta
in
reflected in the initial performance assessment. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period.  ab
le
   v
a
For the Members of the Executive Board, the shares are subject to an additional holding period of two years. During this holding period  lu
e
it is not allowed to sell the vested shares, with the exception of shares withheld or sold to cover for the payment of any applicable 
taxes, social security premiums and possible other deductions by the government due for which the Company holds a withholding 
obligation in connection with the vesting of the shares. In specific circumstances Aegon's Supervisory Board can reclaim variable 
compensation that has already vested (claw back).
Shares as Fixed Compensation F
in
Selected members of the Management Board as well as other senior employees receive part of their fixed compensation in Aegon  an
c
shares each pay round, next to receiving fixed compensation in cash. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume weighted  ia
average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding a plan year  l inf
o
and January 15 of the plan year. Once allocated these shares are unconditional and do not depend on the continued employment  rm
a
of the employee. However, the shares are deferred and cliff-vest three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report  tio
n
has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive 
dividend during the deferral period.
Shares as part of a Sign-on Arrangement
Employees may be offered a sign-on arrangement when joining Aegon, including the allocation of Aegon shares, within the applicable 
O
rules and regulations. Once allocated these shares depend on the continued employment of the employee. These shares are deferred  th
e
and typically cliff-vest after one, two or three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted  r n
o
by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in the last deferral year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during  n

the deferral period. in

st 1  The at target number of shares which were conditionally granted as variable compensation for the plan year. st
ain 2  Shares allocated in the same year are a combination of shares allocated as fixed compensation and sign-on shares which have been allocated during that year  ain
ab (e.g. the 958,501 shares allocated during the calendar year 2019 in relation to the 2019 plan year). Shares allocated during a calendar year in relation to the  ab
le previous plan year concerns the difference between the conditionally granted shares for that plan year and the actual number of shares which have been  le
 va allocated (e.g. the -390,438 share correction during 2019 for the 2018 plan year). This number can therefore be positive or negative. Shares allocated during a   va
lu calendar year in relation to earlier plan years are backdated corrections to the administration (e.g. during 2019 a correction of 30,760 shares was made to the  lu
e 2017 plan year). e
3  This is the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Aegon on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange for the period December 15 to January 15. For instance 
for the 2020 plan year, this is the VWAP for the period December 15, 2019 to January 15, 2020.
4  These fair values were adjusted for expected dividend (for which the participants are not eligible during the deferral period) and for the impact of relative total 
shareholder return as performance indicator for variable compensation (where applicable). The fair values for sign-on shares differed from the other shares 
when the commencement date was after January 2.
F Aegon applies a net settlement option for participants in order to meet their income tax obligations when their shares vest. This means  F
in in
an that Aegon will not sell shares on the market, but hold these shares within Aegon and settle directly with the tax authorities in cash  an
c c
ia rather than selling shares first.  ia

Impairment charges on financial assets in 2020 were mainly driven by Americas impairments on public fixed income holdings, primarily 
in the energy sector, as a consequence of the weakening demand related to the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19.
Impairment charges on non-financial assets and receivables in 2020 amount to EUR 128 million and are mainly related to a valuation 
allowance due to the ongoing rehabilitation process of a reinsurer of Aegon Americas for EUR 68 million and the impairment of an 
associate company of Aegon the Netherlands for EUR 17 million.
V
a
Impairment charges/(reversals) on non-financial assets and receivables in 2019 amounted to EUR 109 million and were mainly  lue
 c
related to a write-off of VOBA and DPAC amounting to EUR 76 million as a result of a liability adequacy test (LAT) deficit in Aegon  re
a
the Netherlands. Refer to note 34 “Insurance contracts” for further details on the LAT impact. In addition, 2019 included the dilution  tio
n
of the capital injections in India (ALIC) of EUR 10 million and impairments to software in the Netherlands of EUR 9 million.
Impairment charges/(reversals) on non-financial assets and receivables in 2018 amounted to EUR 46 million mainly due to updated 
valuations on various real estate properties in the Americas and impairments to software in the Netherlands.

Other charges in 2020 of EUR 150 million are mainly driven by Americas charges of EUR 91 million (USD 104 million) related 
to Universal Life gross legal settlements. Furthermore, other charges include a provision of EUR 45 million related to the resolution 
of pending litigation in the Netherlands. Refer to note 38 Provisions and note 45 Commitments and contingencies for further details.
O
Other charges in 2018 of EUR 375 million include the gross settlement amount of a class action lawsuit regarding certain monthly  th
e
deduction rate adjustments on universal life insurance policies and other related plaintiff and administration fees. The settlement  r n
o
relates to a block of around 70,000 universal life policies on which Transamerica raised the monthly deduction rates in 2015 and 2016.  n
-
f
These adjustments were necessitated by, among other factors, low long-term interest rates and changes in future mortality experience,  in
a
n
and were in accordance with the contractual terms of the policies. Nonetheless, the increases were challenged by policyholders  c
ia
in several court cases. To remove the uncertainty of ongoing litigation for Aegon and its customers, the decision was made to settle  l in
f
with the plaintiffs. In January 2019, a court approved the aforementioned settlement with universal life policyholders. Resolution  o
rm
of this class action ended a number of other related cases, including other related class actions. Over 99% of affected policyholders  a
t
participated in the settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represented approximately 43%  ion
of the value of the settlement fund. The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs, although Aegon continues to hold

a provision for these policyholders. The charge to the income statement for 2018 was EUR 140 million (USD 166 million). Included

Other charges in 2018 also include a loss of EUR 93 million (USD 110 million) related to the divestment of the last substantial block 
of its life reinsurance business to SCOR Global Life. Under the terms of the agreement, Aegon's Transamerica life subsidiaries reinsured 
approximately USD 700 million of liabilities through SCOR Global Life. The transaction covered the last substantial block of life 
reinsurance business that Transamerica retained after it divested the vast majority of its reinsurance business to SCOR Global Life 
in 2011 and 2017.
Furthermore, other charges in 2018 include a loss of EUR 93 million (GBP 81 million) from the divestment of Aegon Ireland Plc. For

a The weighted average applicable statutory tax rate for 2020 is 34.0% (2019: 21.1%, 2018: 23.7%). The weighted average applicable  a
t t
ion statutory tax rate increased compared to 2019 due to relatively high income in 2020 from equity accounted joint ventures and  ion
associates – compared to the total consolidated income – which is presented net of tax in the consolidated income statement.
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 18 238
Non-taxable income in 2020 is comprised of the regular non-taxable items such as the dividend received deduction in the United States 
A
and the participation exemption in the Netherlands. Compared to 2019 non-taxable income decreased due to less exempt income  t a
 g
in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. la
n
c
e
In the Netherlands, the enacted future corporate income tax rate will remain 25% (instead of the earlier enacted 21.7% as from 
January 1, 2021) thereby reversing the beneficial tax rate impact of 2018 and 2019. In the United Kingdom, the previously enacted 
reduction in tax rate was also repealed leading to an increase of corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% which resulted in a 
beneficial tax rate impact.
Tax credits mainly include tax benefits from United States investments that provide affordable housing to individuals and families that 
meet median household income requirements. 
 
Other taxes are lower than previous years due to unfavorable equity markets which yielded lower policyholder taxes in the United  V
a
Kingdom and state tax benefits in the United States due to negative income.  lue
 c
  re
a
Adjustments to prior year mainly consist of a shift between current and deferred tax in the Netherlands due to the recalculation  tio
n
of the technical insurance provisions for tax purposes. 
 
In 2019 ‘Other’ mainly relates to the one-off tax benefit in the United Kingdom due to the release of the historic deferred tax balances 
held in respect of the pension scheme deficit when the defined benefit pension scheme moved to surplus.

le le
 v EUR 0.0015 per common share B, which has financial rights attached to it of 1/40th of a common share. If approved and in combination   v
a a
lu with the interim dividend 2020 of EUR 0.06 per common share, Aegon’s total dividend over 2020 will amount to EUR 0.12 per common  lu
e e
share. After taking into account the interim dividend 2020 of EUR 0.0015 per common share B, Aegon’s total dividend over 2020 will 
amount to EUR 0.003 per common share B.
Interim dividend 2020
The interim dividend 2020 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. Approximately 52% of holders of common 
F shares elected to receive the cash dividend. The remaining 48% of shareholders elected to receive the interim dividend in stock.  F
in in

a third party to execute the transactions on its behalf. The common shares were repurchased at a maximum of the average of the daily 
volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period.
Final dividend 2019
O O
th At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020 it was decided to forego the 2019 final dividend. Aegon decided  th

On October 29, 2020, Aegon’s subsidiary in the Americas completed the sale of the Pyramid building complex in San Francisco, 
California for USD 650 million (EUR 569 million), while retaining the naming rights. As part of the sale transaction, Transamerica 
issued mortgage loans supporting the property at commercial rates in the amount of USD 427 million (EUR 374 million). During  C
2020, the valuation of the property declined prior to the sale closing resulting in a valuation loss of USD 74 million (EUR 65 million).  rea

Aegon the Netherlands partially hedges the risk of future longevity increases in the Netherlands related to a part of its insurance 
liabilities. These longevity derivatives are constructed to pay out if the mortality rates in future years decrease more than a pre-
determined percentage compared with the base scenario at the moment of signing the contract. 
The above mentioned derivatives are used to enhance Aegon’s risk-return profile and to improve capital efficiency.
The derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IAS 39. The value of the longevity derivatives are 
calculated using an internal model as there is no active market for this type of derivatives. For more details refer to the paragraph 
on underwriting risk included in note 34 Insurance contracts and the paragraph on derivatives included in note 44 Fair value. V

purposes are classified as economic hedges to the extent that they do not qualify for hedge accounting, or that Aegon has elected not  ta

Bifurcated embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contracts have been bifurcated and recorded at fair value

C positive). This amount was offset by EUR 255 million negative fair value changes recognized on the derivatives used as hedging  C
rea instrument (2019: EUR 354 million negative).  rea
t t
in in
g g
 su Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  su
s s
ta Aegon has entered primarily into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain variable-rate assets and liabilities  ta
in in
ab to a fixed-rate basis in order to match the cash flows of the assets and liabilities within Aegon’s portfolio more closely. These  ab
le le
 v agreements involve the payment or receipt of variable-rate interest amounts in exchange for fixed-rate interest amounts over the life   v
a a
lu of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future  lu
e e
cash flows from the interest rate movements for terms up to 24 years for hedges converting existing floating-rate assets and liabilities 
to fixed-rate assets. 
Aegon uses forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with the forecasted 
purchase of fixed-income assets. These agreements reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on the forecasted transaction. 
F Fair value adjustments for these interest rate swaps are deferred and recorded in equity until the occurrence of the forecasted  F
in in
an transaction at which time the interest rate swaps will be terminated. The accumulated gain or loss in equity will be amortized into  an
c c
ia investment income as the acquired asset affects income. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from  ia
l inf interest rate movements for terms up to 23 years. The cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to affect the profit  l inf
o o
rm and loss for approximately the next 32 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the contracts for which cash flow hedge  rm
a a
tio accounting was terminated resulted in deferred gains of EUR 186 million (2019: EUR 112 million) that are recognized directly  tio
n n
in equity to be reclassified into net income during the period when the cash flows occur of the underlying hedged items. During 
the year ended December 31, 2020, none of Aegon's cash flow hedges were discontinued as it was highly probable that the original 
forecasted transactions would occur by the end of the originally specified time period documented at the inception of the hedging 
relationship. Aegon projects investment needs many years into the future in order to support the insurance liabilities and pay all 
contractual obligations arising from the policies in force today.

Effect of uncertainty of IBOR reform on derivatives designated as fair value and cash flows hedges lue
 c
The future of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates) such as Euribor, Eonia and LIBOR has been a major topic on the global agenda since  re
a
the G20 asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to undertake a fundamental review of leading interest rate benchmarks in 2013.  tio
n
The FSB proposed new standards to reform interest rate benchmarks and the use of transaction-based input data instead of non-
transactional/panel input data. In the EU this is adopted in the new Benchmark Regulation (BMR) which stipulates that from January 
2020 only BMR compliant benchmarks may be used within the EU.
Despite current uncertainties on how the transition from IBORs to alternative benchmarks will be managed, it is widely acknowledged 
that IBOR benchmarks impact financial products and contracts, including among others derivatives, corporate bonds, structured 
debt products, deposits and mortgages. Aegon recognizes that IBOR transitions potentially have implications for all reporting units,  C
including its insurance, asset management and banking activities. The impact of the IBOR transition on the business and operating  rea
t
models are described in transition plans and include among others project solutions and actions, timelines and ownership to ensure  in
g
timely preparation and implementation. We are currently implementing the actions as described in the transition plans. In July 2020   su
s
the discount rates of EUR cleared derivatives switched from EONIA to €STR which impacted the valuation of derivatives for which  ta
in
compensation was exchanged. We are in discussions with our counterparties on amending the EUR CSAs from EONIA to €STR.  ab
le
In the US, the cleared market has switched discount rates from Fed Funds to SOFR in October 2020. The switch in discount rates   v
a
is expected to lead to increased liquidity in the new risk free rates. lu
e
The majority of the fair value and cash flow hedges are directly exposed to changes in benchmark rates (predominantly Euribor and USD 
Libor) where it is not clear until when these benchmark rates will be continued and/or how they will transition to alternative rates. For 
example, the majority of financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges have a maturity date beyond December 31, 
2021 (Net notional amount: EUR 15,320 million, 2019: EUR 12,165 million).
F
in
Aegon applies the reliefs offered in IAS 39 to ensure that this uncertainty does not result in the early termination of hedge accounting,  an
c
whilst also assuming for measurement purposes that, owing to the general principle of equivalence, transitions to alternative rates will  ia
not result in significant contract modifications. l inf
o
rm
a
Net foreign investment hedges tio
n
Aegon funds its investments in insurance subsidiaries with a mixture of debt and equity. Aegon aims to denominate debt funding 
in the same currency as the functional currency of the investment. Investments outside the Eurozone, the United States and the United 
Kingdom are funded in euros. When the debt funding of investments is not in the functional currency of the investment, Aegon uses 
derivatives to swap the currency exposure of the debt instrument to the appropriate functional currency. This policy will ensure that 
total capital will reflect currency movements without distorting debt to shareholders’ equity ratios. Aegon utilizes various financial 
O
instruments as designated hedging instruments of its foreign investments. These instruments include long-term and short-term  th
e
borrowings, short-term debts to credit institutions, cross currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts.  r n

During 2020, there were several changes in the composition of the investments in joint ventures in associates. The additions to joint 
ventures are mainly explained by the expansion of Aegon's partnership with Santander in Spain. The disposals mainly relates 
to the completion of the sale of Aegon's 50% stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan. Please refer to note 48 for further 
details. In addition, as a result of a dilution in voting rights, Aegon's investment in Amvest Residential Core Fund was reclassified from 
joint ventures to associates. 
C With the exception of a limited number of immaterial venture capital entities, all joint ventures and associates are unlisted and  C
rea are accounted for using the equity method and are considered to be non-current. The investments in joint ventures and associates  rea
t t

g g
 su restrictions can affect the ability of these joint ventures and associates to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, or repayment   su

F Amortization and depreciation through income statement is included in Commissions and expenses. None of the intangible assets have  F

an titles that are restricted or have been pledged as security for liabilities.  an
c c
ia ia
l inf With the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have a finite useful life and are amortized accordingly. VOBA and future servicing  l inf
o o
rm rights are amortized over the term of the related insurance contracts, which can vary significantly depending on the maturity  rm
a a
tio of the acquired portfolio. The amortization is based on either the expected future premiums, revenues or the expected gross profit  tio
n n
margins, which for the most significant blocks of business ranges between 50 and 80 years. Future servicing rights are amortized over 
a period of 10 to 30 years of which 13 years remain at December 31, 2020 (2019: 15 years). Software is generally depreciated over 
an average period of 3 to 5 years (no changes compared to 2019).
Goodwill
O O
th The goodwill balance has been allocated across the cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies inherent  th
e e
r n in the goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment both annually and when there are specific indicators of a potential impairment.  r n
o o
n The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal for a cash-generating unit. The operating  n
- -
f f
in assumptions used in all the calculations are best estimate assumptions and based on historical data where available.  in
a a
n n
c c
ia ia
l in The economic assumptions used in all the calculations are based on observable market data and projections of future trends. All  l in
f f
o the cash-generating units tested showed that the recoverable amount was higher than their carrying values, including goodwill.  o
rm rm
a A reasonably possible change in any key assumption is not expected to cause the carrying value of the cash-generating units to exceed  a
t t
ion its recoverable amount. ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020

Goodwill in Aegon Americas is allocated to groups of cash-generating units including variable annuities, fixed annuities and 
the retirement plans cash-generating unit. Value in use calculations of Aegon Americas have been actuarially determined based 
on business plans covering a period of typically three years and pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates. Based on the value in use tests,  V
a
goodwill in the Americas for the group of annuities cash-generating units (2020: EUR 116 million: 2019: EUR 127 million) and  lue
 c
the retirement plans cash-generating unit (2020: EUR 52 million: 2019: EUR 56 million) remain unchanged from prior year except  re
a
for the impact of currency translation adjustments. The value in use tests assume business plans covering a period of 3 years further  tio
n
extrapolated to 10 years, where the new business levels for years 4-10 assumed a 0% growth rate (2019: 0%). The pre-tax adjusted 
discount rate was 7.6% for both annuities and retirement plans.
For Aegon the Netherlands, goodwill was allocated to Robidus – a cash generating unit whose value in use exceeds its carrying value. 
The value in use calculations were based on business plans covering a period of five years, pre-tax discount rate of 7.6%, post-tax 
discount rate of 7.2%, and terminal growth rate at 1%. The goodwill arises mainly from new customers, future software platform 
developments, synergies, and assembled workforce. C

34.1 Underwriting risk ia
Aegon’s earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which actual claims experience differs from the assumptions used in setting  l inf
o
the prices for products and establishing the technical liabilities and liabilities for claims. To the extent that actual claims experience  rm
a
is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, income would be reduced. Furthermore, if these  tio
n
higher claims were part of a permanent trend, Aegon may be required to change best estimate assumptions for future claims which 
could increase the required reserves for these future claims, which could reduce income. In addition, certain acquisition costs related 
to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets on the statement of financial 
position and are being amortized into the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these 
policies (such as future claims, investment income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated 
O
and may even require write offs should there be an expectation of unrecoverability. This could have a materially adverse effect  th
e
on Aegon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. r n
o
n
-
f
Sources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses, surrender of policies or partial withdrawals), policy claims  in
a
n
(such as mortality, longevity or morbidity) and expenses. For some product lines, Aegon is at risk if policy lapses increase as sometimes  c
ia
Aegon is unable to fully recover upfront expenses in selling a product despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender  l in
f
charges and fees. There are also products where Aegon is at risk if lapses decrease, for example where this would result in a higher  o
rm
utilization rate of product guarantees. For mortality and morbidity risk, Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality  a
t
or morbidity increases, such as term life insurance and accident insurance, Aegon also sells certain types of policies that are at risk  ion
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
266 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 34 267
if mortality decreases (longevity risk) such as annuity products. Aegon is also at risk if expenses are higher than the expenses assumed 
A A
t a beforehand by management and that were priced into the products. t a
 g  g
la la
n n
c Aegon monitors and manages its underwriting risk by underwriting risk type. Attribution analysis is performed on earnings and reserve  c
e e
movements in order to understand the source of any material variation in actual results from what was expected. Aegon’s units 
also perform experience studies for underwriting risk assumptions, comparing Aegon’s experience to industry experience as well 
as combining Aegon’s experience and industry experience based on the depth of the history of each source to Aegon’s underwriting 
assumptions. Where policy charges are flexible in products, Aegon uses these analyses as the basis for modifying these charges, with 
a view to maintain a balance between policyholder and shareholder interests. Aegon also has the ability to reduce expense levels over 
time, thus mitigating unfavorable expense variation.
Sensitivity analysis of net income and shareholders’ equity to various underwriting risks is shown in the table that follows. Aegon's best 
V estimate assumptions already include expected future developments and the sensitivities represent an increase or decrease of lapse  V
a a
lue rates, mortality rates and morbidity rates, compared to Aegon's best estimate assumptions. These underwriting sensitivities were run  lue
 c  c
re using a permanent shock applied to all of Aegon's products, exposed to an increase and to a decrease in the rates. The table below  re
a a
tio indicates that the morbidity sensitivity has the largest impact and in aggregate, Aegon is exposed to a decrease in mortality rates.  tio

The LAT deficit per December 31, 2020 in Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR 7.0 billion (2019: EUR 5.1 billion), which was 
partially offset by the shadow loss recognition of EUR 4.5 billion (2019: EUR 3.4 billion), resulting in a net deficit of EUR 2.5 billion 
(2019: EUR 1.7 billion).
During 2020, the net LAT deficit of Aegon the Netherlands worsened from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 2.5 billion, which led 
to the recognition of additional insurance contracts liabilities per December 31, 2020 of EUR 0.8 billion. The LAT deficit was negatively 
impacted by the impact of lower interest rate of EUR 1.5 billion (2019: EUR 1.3 billion) and adverse credit spread movements (widening  C
mortgage spreads, tightened liquidity premium) of EUR 0.3 billion (2019: EUR 0.8 billion). This was partly offset by other favorable  rea
t
impacts (model and assumptions updates and portfolio changes) totaling EUR 1.0 billion (2019: EUR 0.2 billion negative). in
g
 s
u
s
As a result of the current deficit, changes in the LAT of Aegon the Netherlands, triggered by up or down movements in interest rates,  ta
in
are directly recognized in the income statement. However, net income is less sensitive to interest rate movements as the results from  ab
le
interest rate hedging are also recognized in net income.  v
a
lu
e
Furthermore, as a result of the current negative LAT deficit position, results are volatile due to changes in credit spreads as these are 
not hedged. Please find below the estimated sensitivities on shareholders’ equity and on net income, for up and down shocks for credit 
spreads, mortgage spreads for the bond and mortgage portfolio and liquidity premium shocks for general account insurance liabilities.

lu 36 Guarantees in insurance contracts lu
e e
For financial reporting purposes Aegon distinguishes between the following types of minimum guarantees:
a.  Financial guarantees: these guarantees are treated as bifurcated embedded derivatives, valued at fair value and presented as 
derivatives (refer to note 2.9 and note 44 Fair value);
b.  Total return annuities: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts because they are presented and valued at fair 
value together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19);
F c.  Life contingent guarantees in the United States: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, presented and  F
in in
an valued in accordance with insurance accounting together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19); and an
c c
ia d.  Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued at  ia
l inf fair value and presented together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19 and note 44 Fair value). l inf
o o
rm rm
a a
tio In addition to the guarantees mentioned above, Aegon has traditional life insurance contracts that include minimum guarantees that  tio
n n
are not valued explicitly; however, the adequacy of all insurance liabilities, net of VOBA and DPAC, and including all guarantees, are 
assessed periodically (refer to note 2.19).
a. Financial guarantees
In the United States and in the United Kingdom, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is offered directly on some 
O O
th variable annuity products Aegon issues and is also assumed from a ceding company. Variable annuities allow a customer to provide  th
e e
r n for the future on a tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market performance. Variable annuities allow a customer  r n
o o
n to select payout options designed to help meet the customer’s need for income upon maturity, including lump sum payment or income  n
- -
f f
in for life or for a period of time. This benefit guarantees that a policyholder can withdraw a certain percentage of the account value,  in
a a
n n
c starting at a certain age or duration, for either a fixed period or during the life of the policyholder. c
ia ia
l in l in
f f
o In the Netherlands, individual variable unit-linked products have a minimum benefit guarantee if premiums are invested in certain  o
rm rm
a funds. The sum insured at maturity or upon the death of the beneficiary has a minimum guaranteed return (in the range of 3% to 4%)  a
t t
ion if the premium has been paid for a consecutive period of at least ten years and is invested in a mixed fund and/or fixed-income funds.  ion
No guarantees are given if the invested amount is in equity only.

6  The net amount at risk represents the sum of the positive differences between the discounted maximum amount payable under the guarantees and the account value.
The increase of incurred guarantee benefits in 2020 mainly relates to decreasing interest rates, partly offset by overall rising 
equity markets. The decreased account value in 2020 was mainly driven by foreign currency translation differences, partly offset 
by decreasing interest rates and rising equity markets.
Aegon Americas mitigates the exposure from the elective guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider issued with a ceding  C
company’s variable annuity contracts. The rider is essentially a return of premium guarantee, which is payable over a period of at least  rea
t
14 years from the date that the policyholder elects to start withdrawals. At contract inception, the guaranteed remaining balance  in
g
is equal to the premium payment. The periodic withdrawal is paid by the ceding company until the account value is insufficient   su
s
to cover additional withdrawals. Once the account value is exhausted, Aegon pays the periodic withdrawals until the guaranteed  ta
in
remaining balance is exhausted. At December 31, 2020, the reinsured account value was EUR 1.7 billion (2019: EUR 1.8 billion) and  ab
le
the guaranteed remaining balance was EUR 0.8 billion (2019: EUR 1.1 billion).  v
a
lu
e
The GMWB rider Aegon assumed from the ceding company is accounted for as a derivative and is carried in Aegon’s statement 
of financial position at fair value. At December 31, 2020, the contract had a value of EUR 46 million (2019: EUR 37 million). 
Aegon entered into a derivative program to mitigate the overall exposure to equity market and interest rate risks associated with 
the reinsurance contract. This program involves selling equity futures contracts and equity total return swap contracts (S&P 500, 
Midcap, Russell 2000, and the MCSI EAFE index in accordance with Aegon’s exposure) to mitigate the effect of equity market 
movement on the reinsurance contracts and the purchase of interest rate swaps, treasury futures and treasury forwards to mitigate  F
in
the effect of movements in interest rates on the reinsurance contracts. an
c
ia
Aegon the Netherlands provides guarantees to its customers on expiry date for certain insurance contracts. In order to mitigate  l inf
o
the risks related to the guarantees Aegon the Netherlands has setup a hedging program. Aegon the Netherlands does not use  rm
a
reinsurance in order to mitigate risks related to insurance contracts with a guarantee component.  tio
n
b. Total return annuities
Total Return Annuity (TRA) is an annuity product in the United States which provides customers with a pass-through of the total 
return on an underlying portfolio of investment securities (typically a mix of corporate and convertible bonds) subject to a cumulative 
minimum guarantee. Both the assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, however, due to the minimum guarantee not all 
O
of the changes in the market value of the asset will be offset in the valuation of the liability. This product exists for the fixed annuity  th
e
line of business and represents a closed block. r n
o
n
-
f
The fixed annuities product balance as of December 31, 2020, amounted to EUR 186 million (2019: EUR 234 million). in

c. Life contingent guarantees in the United States l in
f
Certain variable insurance contracts in the United States also provide guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed  o
rm
minimum income benefits (GMIB). Under a GMDB, the beneficiaries receive the greater of the account balance or the guaranteed  a
t
amount upon the death of the insured. The net amount at risk for GMDB contracts is defined as the current GMDB in excess  ion
of the capital account balance at the reporting date.
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
272 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 36 273
The GMIB feature provides for minimum payments if the contract holder elects to convert to an immediate payout annuity. 
A A
t a The guaranteed amount is calculated using the total deposits made by the contract holder, less any withdrawals and sometimes  t a
 g  g
la includes a roll-up or step-up feature that increases the value of the guarantee with interest or with increases in the account value.  la
n n
c c
e e
The additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated are determined each period by estimating the expected 
value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over the accumulation period based on total 
expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment to the additional liability is recognized 
in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range 
of stochastic scenarios. Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates a percentage of the potential annuitizations that 
may be elected by the contract holder.

d. Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands
F The traditional life and pension products offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include various products that accumulate a cash value.  F
in in
an Premiums are paid by customers at inception or over the term of the contract. The accumulation products pay benefits on the policy  an
c c
ia maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. In addition, most policies also pay death benefits if the insured dies during the term  ia
l inf of the contract. The death benefits may be stipulated in the policy or depend on the gross premiums paid to date. Premiums and  l inf
o o
rm amounts insured are established at inception of the contract. The amount insured can be increased as a result of profit sharing,  rm
a a
tio if provided for under the terms and conditions of the product. Minimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of traditional  tio
n n
accumulation products written. Older generations contain a 4% guarantee; in 1999 the guarantee decreased to 3% and in 2013 
the guarantee decreased to 0%.
The traditional group pension contracts offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include large group insurance contracts that have 
an individually determined asset investment strategy underlying the pension contract. The guarantee given is that the profit 
O O
th sharing is the maximum of 0% and the realized return on an asset portfolio specified in the policy conditions, adjusted for technical  th
e e
r n interest rates ranging from 3% to 4%. If the adjusted return is negative, the 0% minimum is effective, but the loss in any given year  r n
o o
n is carried forward to be offset against any future surpluses within the contract period. In general, a guarantee is given for the life  n
- -
f f
in of the underlying employees so that their pension benefit is guaranteed. Large group contracts also share technical results (mortality  in
a a
n n
c risk and disability risk). The contract period is typically five years and the premiums are fixed over this period. c

Fair value measurement of guarantees in insurance contracts
The fair values of guarantees mentioned above (with the exception of life contingent guarantees in the United States) are calculated 
as the present value of future expected payments to policyholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable 
to the guarantees. For further details refer to note 44 Fair value.
For equity volatility, Aegon uses a term structure assumption with market-based implied volatility inputs for the first five years  C
and a long-term forward rate assumption of 25% thereafter. The volume of observable option trading from which volatilities are  rea
t
derived generally declines as the contracts’ term increases, therefore, the volatility curve grades from implied volatilities for five  in
g
years to the ultimate rate. The resulting volatility assumption in year 20 for the S&P 500 index (expressed as a spot rate) was   su
s
22.6% at December 31, 2020, and 21.1% at December 31, 2019. Correlations of market returns across underlying indices are based  ta
in
on historical market returns and their inter-relationships over a number of years preceding the valuation date. Assumptions regarding  ab
le
policyholder behavior, such as lapses, included in the models are derived in the same way as the assumptions used to measure   v
a
insurance liabilities. lu
e
These assumptions are reviewed at each valuation date, and updated based on historical experience and observable market data, 
including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. Disclosure on interest rate risk, including interest rate 
risk sensitivity is included in note 4 Financial risks.
Aegon utilizes different risk management strategies to mitigate the financial impact of the valuation of these guarantees on the results  F
in
including asset and liability management and derivative hedging strategies to hedge certain aspects of the market risks embedded  an
c
in these guarantees.  ia
l in
f
o
Guarantees valued at fair value contributed a net gain before tax of EUR 539 million (2019: gain of EUR 424 million) to earnings.  rm
a
The main drivers of this gain before tax are a fair value gain on hedges related to the guarantee reserves of EUR 3,199 million  tio
n
(2019: EUR 1,840 million gain), a gain of EUR 380 million related to an increase in equity markets (2019: EUR 1,585 million gain), 
a gain of EUR 234 million related to widening own credit spread (2019: EUR 42 million gain) and other and DPAC offset contributed 
a gain of EUR 305 million (2019: EUR 273 million gain). These gains are partly offset by negative results related to decreases in risk 
free rates of EUR 3,775 million (2019: EUR 3,281 million loss) and a loss of EUR 134 million related to increases in equity volatility 
(2019: EUR 12 million gain).

Aegon USA l in
f
Aegon USA has defined benefit plans covering substantially all its employees that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Service  o
rm
Code, including all requirements for minimum funding levels. The defined benefit plans are governed by the Board of Directors  a
t
of Transamerica Corporation. The Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to administer the plan and to apply all of its  ion
provisions, including such responsibilities as, but not limited to, developing the investment policy and managing assets for the plan,

maintaining required funding levels for the plan, deciding questions related to eligibility and benefit amounts, resolving disputes 
A A
t a that may arise from plan participants and for complying with the plan provisions, and legal requirements related to the plan and its  t a
 g  g
la operation. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits  la
n n
c based on a traditional final average formula or a cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a stated account  c
e e
balance), depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The defined benefit plans have a deficit of EUR 436 million 
at December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 388 million deficit).
Investment strategies are established based on asset and liability studies by actuaries which are updated as they consider appropriate. 
These studies, along with the investment policy, assist to develop the appropriate investment criteria for the plan, including asset 
allocation mix, return objectives, investment risk and time horizon, benchmarks and performance standards, and restrictions and 
prohibitions. The overall goal is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for the present and anticipated 
future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. Aegon believes that the asset 
V allocation is an important factor in determining the long-term performance of the plan. The plan uses multiple asset classes as well  V
a a
lue as sub-classes to meet the asset allocation and other requirements of the investment policy, which minimizes investment risk. From  lue
 c  c
re time to time the actual asset allocation may deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges due to different market performance  re
a a
tio among the various asset categories. If it is determined that rebalancing is required, future additions and withdrawals will be used  tio
n n
to bring the allocation to the desired level.
Aegon USA maintains minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. If contributions are required, 
the funding would be provided from the Company’s general account assets. Pension plan contributions were not required for Aegon 
USA in 2020 or 2019. However, with the Aegon N.V. Management Board approval of a proposal from Transamerica Corporation, 
Transamerica Corporation made a pension plan contribution of EUR 223 million in September 2019 that was over and above 
C the minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2020, Transamerica Corporation did not make  C
rea a pension plan contribution. rea

The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits based on a 
traditional final average formula or a cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a stated account balance), 
depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The company funds the benefit payments of the supplemental retirement 
plans from its general account assets. The unfunded amount related to these plans, for which a liability has been recorded, was

Aegon the Netherlands 
Aegon the Netherlands has a number of defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are subject 
O
to Dutch Pension regulations and governed by the Board of Directors of Aegon the Netherlands. The Board of Directors has the full  th
e
power and discretion to administer the plan including developing investment policy and managing assets for the plans (although these  r n
o
assets do not qualify as ‘plan assets’ as defined by IFRS), deciding questions related to eligibility and benefit amounts, and any disputes  n
-
f
that may arise from plan participants and for complying with the plan provisions, and legal requirements related to the plan and its  in
a
n
operation. Aegon the Netherlands runs, in principle, full actuarial and investment risk regarding the defined benefit plans. This includes  c
ia
the risks of low interest rates, low returns and increased longevity. A part of this risk can be attributed to plan participants by lowering  l in
f
indexation or by increasing employee contributions. o

Investment strategies are established based on asset and liability studies. The overall goal is to maximize total investment returns 
to provide sufficient funding for the present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level 
of portfolio risk. These studies use for example return objectives and various investment instruments. Investment restrictions are 
updated regularly and they result in asset allocation mix and hedges.
As at December 31, 2019, Aegon the Netherlands amended the defined benefit pension plan for their own employees. As of January 1, 
2020, the defined benefit pension plan is closed for new members and there will be no further accrual of benefits to existing members. 
Entitlements before January 1, 2020, will remain unchanged and the indexation for those accruals will remain in force.

Aegon UK rea
t
Aegon UK operated a defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits for staff based on final pensionable salary and years  in
g
of service. The scheme closed to new entrants a number of years ago and closed to future accrual on March 31, 2013. Aegon UK now   su
s
offers a defined contribution pension scheme to all employees. ta
in
a
b
le
The pension scheme is administered separately from Aegon UK and is governed by Trustees, who are required to act in the best   v
a
interests of the pension scheme members. lu
e
The pension scheme Trustees are required to carry out triennial valuations on the scheme’s funding position, with the latest valuation 
being as at March 31, 2019. As part of this triennial valuation process, a schedule of contributions is agreed between the Trustees 
and Aegon UK in accordance with UK pensions legislation and guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator in the UK. The schedule 
of contributions includes deficit reduction contributions to clear any scheme deficit. Under IAS 19, the defined benefit plan has 
a surplus of EUR 43 million at December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 1 million surplus). During 2020, EUR 54 million (2019: EUR 83 million)  F
in
of contributions were paid into the scheme. an
c
ia
The investment strategy for the scheme is determined by the trustees in consultation with Aegon UK. Currently 30% of assets are  l inf
o
invested in growth assets (i.e. primarily equities) and 70% are income and liability driven investments where the investments are  rm
a
a portfolio of fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds and related derivatives, selected to broadly match the interest rate and inflation  tio
n
profile of liabilities.
Under the scheme rules, pensions in payment increase in line with the UK Retail Price Index, and deferred benefits increase in line 
with the UK Consumer Price Index. The pension scheme is therefore exposed to UK inflation changes as well as interest rate risks, 
investment returns and changes in the life expectancy of pensioners.
O

h
e
The scheme purchased a buy-in policy in the name of the Trustee to cover full scheme benefits for a group of pensioners  r n

43 Capital management and solvency
Strategic importance
Aegon’s approach towards capital management plays a vital role in supporting the execution of its strategy. The key capital 
management priority is to ensure adequate capitalization to cover Aegon’s obligations towards its policyholders and debtholders while  V
a
providing sustainable dividends to shareholders. This priority is accomplished by allocating capital to products that offer high growth  lue
 c
and return prospects.  re
a
t
io
n
Management of capital
Disciplined risk and capital management support Aegon’s decisions in deploying the capital that is generated 
in the Company's businesses and that is provided for by investors. Aegon balances the funding of new business growth with 
the funding required to ensure that its obligations towards policyholders and debtholders are always adequately met, and providing for 
a sustainable dividend to shareholders.
Aegon’s goal for both its operating units and for the Aegon group as a whole is to maintain a strong financial position and to be able  C
to sustain losses from extreme business and market conditions. A       egon’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework ensures  rea
t
that the Aegon Group and its operating companies are adequately capitalized and that obligations towards policyholders are always  in
g
adequately met. Embedded in this larger framework is Aegon’s capital management policy. The update in 2020 simplified the policy   su
s
while ensuring that strong capital positions are maintained at the Group and in the units. Aegon's capital management framework  ta
in
is based on adequate capitalization of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding and leverage. ab
le
 v
a
Aegon manages capital in the operating units to their respective operating levels, sufficient to absorb moderate shocks and pay  lu
e
sustainable remittances to the Group, and above their minimum dividend payment levels. Cash Capital at Holding is maintained within 
an operating range of EUR 0.5 – 1.5 billion and covers holding expenses, near-term dividends, and contingencies, such as potential 
recapitalization of units. Furthermore, Aegon aims to reduce its gross financial leverage from the current level of EUR 6.0 billion 
to the range of EUR 5.0 – 5.5 billion over the period of 2021 to 2023. This reduction of leverage will strengthen the balance sheet, 
reduce Aegon’s risk profile and therefore make Aegon more resilient.
F
in
The frequent monitoring of actual and forecasted capitalization levels of its underlying businesses is an important element  an
c
in Aegon's capital framework in order to actively steer and manage towards maintaining adequate capitalization levels. ia
l in
f
o
Aegon Group Solvency Ratio rm
a
To calculate its Group Solvency Ratio, Aegon applies a combination of the Group consolidation methods available under Solvency II:  tio
n
the Accounting Consolidation (AC) and Deduction & Aggregation (D&A) based methods. Solvency II capital requirements are mainly 
used for the European Economic Area (EEA)-based insurance and reinsurance entities, applying the AC method. Local requirements 
are used for insurance and reinsurance entities in (provisionally) equivalent third-country jurisdictions. Since January 31, 2020, 
the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. Absent any regulatory guidance to the contrary, Aegon’s UK 
insurance subsidiaries will continue to be included in the Group Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, 
O
including Aegon’s approved Partial Internal Model. For more details, reference is made to the section “Regulation and Supervision”.  th
e
On July 11 2020, DNB published industry-wide guidelines regarding the treatment of banks in Group Solvency II calculation. As a  r n
o
consequence, Aegon has included Aegon Bank in the calculation of its Group Solvency on December 31, 2020. n
-
f
in
a
n
The Group Solvency II ratio is calculated as the ratio between the Eligible Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).  c
ia
The Eligible Own Funds equal to the Available Own Funds after applying any Own Funds eligibility restrictions. l in

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
286 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 43 287
The Group SCR is calculated based on Solvency II Partial Internal Model (PIM), which includes the SCR of AC entities, the D&A entities 
A A
t a and the Other Financial Sector entities (including Aegon Bank). The SCR amount (or 100% Solvency II ratio) reflects a level of Eligible  t a
 g  g
la Own Funds that enables insurance and reinsurance entities to absorb significant losses (1-in-200 year events) and gives reasonable  la
n n
c assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made as they fall due. On December 31, 2020, Aegon's estimated  c
e e
capital position was:
December 31, 2020 1) December 31, 20192)
Group Own Funds 18,582 18,470
Group SCR 9,473 9,173
Group Solvency II ratio 196% 201%
1  The Solvency II ratios are estimates, are not final until filed with the respective supervisory authority.
2  For 2019, the Group Solvency II ratio excludes Aegon Bank. The 2019 Group Solvency II ratio including Aegon Bank is 198% (Own Funds: EUR 19,207 million; 
SCR: EUR 9,707 million).

lu lu
e e
 c  c
re Aegon Group Eligible Own Funds amounted to EUR 18,582 million on December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 18,470 million1). The increase  re
a a
tio of EUR 112 million in Own Funds since December 31, 2019, was mostly driven by the positive impact from expected return on in- tio
n n
force business and the inclusion of Aegon Bank. The positive impact was partly offset by unfavorable market impacts triggered 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, reflected by a sharp decrease in interest rates, compounded by negative credit variances partly caused 
by widening of mortgage spreads.
Aegon's Group PIM SCR amounted to EUR 9,473 million on December 31, 2020 (2019: EUR 9,173 million2). The SCR increased 
by EUR 300 million since December 31, 2019 and was mainly due to new business strain and the inclusion of Aegon Bank, which was 
C partly offset by the release of in-force SCR. As a result of the above changes in Eligible Own Funds and PIM SCR, the Group Solvency  C
rea II ratio declined by 5%-points to 196% in 2020. rea
t t
in in
g g
 su Minimum regulatory requirements  su
s s
ta Insurance laws and regulations in local regulatory jurisdictions often contain minimum regulatory capital requirements. For insurance  ta
in in
ab companies in the European Union, Solvency II formally defines a lower capital requirement, being the Minimum Capital Requirement  ab
le le
 v (MCR). An irreparable breach of the MCR would lead to a withdrawal of the Company's insurance license. Similarly, for the US insurance   v
a a
lu entities the withdrawal of the insurance license is triggered by a breach of the 100% Authorized Control Level (ACL), which is set  lu
e e
at 50% of the Company Action Level (CAL).
With the introduction of Solvency II for EEA countries, Aegon views the higher capital requirement, 100% of the SCR, as the level 
around which EU supervisors will formally require management to provide regulatory recovery plans. For the US insurance entities this 
is viewed at 100% CLA.
F F
in in
an During 2020, the Aegon Group and the regulated entities within the Aegon Group that are subject to regulatory capital requirements  an
c c
ia on a solo-level continued to comply with the solvency requirements. ia

o o
rm Capital quality rm
a a
tio Aegon’s capital consists of 3 Tiers as an indication of its quality, with Tier 1 capital ranking the highest. The Available Own Funds is an  tio
n n
estimate, has not been filed with the regulator and is subject to supervisory review. It is to be noted that the Group Own Funds do not 
include any contingent liability potentially arising from unit-linked products sold, issued or advised on by Aegon in the Netherlands 
in the past as the potential liability cannot be reliably quantified at this point.

On December 31, 2020, Tier 1 capital amounted to EUR 15,542 million, which includes EUR 2,571 million restricted Tier 1 capital. 
Restricted Tier 1 capital consists of Aegon's junior perpetual capital securities (2020: EUR 1,563 million), perpetual cumulative

288 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 43 289
The Solvency II revaluations and reclassification of EUR 9,418 million negative (2019: EUR 8,206 million negative) mainly stem from 
A A
t a the difference in valuation and presentation between IFRS-EU and Solvency II frameworks. The change in Solvency II revaluations per  t a
 g  g
la December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is mainly driven by lower interest rates during 2020, increasing the revaluation  la
n n
c reserves in Aegon US. The Solvency II revaluations and reclassification can be grouped into four categories: c
e e
	Items that are not recognized under Solvency II. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon include Goodwill, deferred 
policy acquisition costs (DPAC) and other intangible assets (EUR 1,989 million negative, 2019: EUR 1,932 million negative);
	Items that have a different valuation treatment between IFRS-EU and Solvency II. Solvency II is a market consistent framework 
hence all assets and liabilities are to be presented at fair value while IFRS-EU also includes other valuation treatments in addition 
to fair value. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon Group include loans and mortgages, reinsurance recoverables, 
and technical provisions. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 2,878 million positive (2019: 
EUR 2,753 million positive) compared to the IFRS-EU Statement of Financial Position;
	The Net Asset Value of subsidiaries that are included under the D&A method (on provisional equivalence or Standard Formula basis) 
V in the Group Solvency II results. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 6,942 million negative  V
a a
lue (2019: EUR 5,655 million negative) compared to the IFRS-EU Statement of Financial Position, where the revaluation reserves  lue
 c  c
re increased in Aegon US mainly driven by lower interest rates during 2020; re
atio 	Reclassification of subordinated liabilities of EUR 3,366 million negative (2019: EUR 3,372 negative). atio
n n
The transferability restrictions reflect the restrictions on Tier 1 unrestricted Own Funds as a consequence of the RBC CAL conversion 
methodology as described above.
The availability adjustments are changes to the availability of Own Funds of Aegon Group in accordance with Solvency II requirements. 
Examples include the adjustments for subordinated liabilities, ring-fenced fund, treasury shares and foreseeable dividend.
C C
rea Finally, the fungibility restrictions limit the availability of Own Funds on Aegon Group level as prescribed by Supervisory Authorities.  rea

as debt or debt-like funding issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing Aegon’s business units. Total financial leverage 
includes hybrid instruments, in addition to both subordinated and senior debt. Aegon’s total capitalization comprises the following

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
290 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 44 291
The ability of Aegon's operating units, principally insurance companies, to pay remittances to the holding company is constrained 
A A
t a by the requirement for these operating units to remain adequately capitalized to the levels set by local insurance regulations and  t a
 g  g
la governed by local insurance supervisory authorities. Based on the capitalization level of the operating units, local insurance supervisors  la
n n
c are able to restrict and/or prohibit the transfer of remittances to the holding company. In addition, the ability of operating units to pay  c
e e
remittances to the holding company can be constrained by the requirement for these operating units to hold sufficient shareholders' 
equity as determined by law. The capitalization level and shareholders' equity of the operating units can be impacted by various 
factors (e.g. general economic conditions, capital market risks, underwriting risk factors, changes in government regulations, and 
legal and arbitrational proceedings). To mitigate the impact of such factors on the ability of operating units to transfer funds, Aegon 
establishes an operating level of capital in each of the units, 150% SCR for Solvency II units and 400% RBC CAL in the US, which 
includes additional capital in excess of regulatory capital requirements. Aegon manages capital in the units to this operating level 
over-the-cycle.
V 44 Fair value V
a a
lue The estimated fair values of Aegon’s assets and liabilities correspond with the amounts that would be received to sell an asset or paid  lue
 c  c
re to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When available, Aegon uses  re
a a
tio quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of investments and derivatives. In the absence of an active market,  tio
n n
the fair value of investments in financial assets is estimated by using other market observable data, such as corroborated external 
quotes and present value or other valuation techniques. An active market is one in which transactions are taking place regularly on an 
arm’s length basis. Fair value is not determined based upon a forced liquidation or distressed sale.
Valuation techniques are used when Aegon determines the market is inactive or quoted market prices are not available for the asset 
or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, to estimate 
C the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants  C
rea at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a  rea
t t
in market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect Aegon’s own assumptions about  in
g g
 su the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). These inputs are   su
s s
ta developed based on the best information available. ta
in in
a a
b b
le le
 v Aegon employs an oversight structure over valuation of financial instruments that includes appropriate segregation of duties. Senior   v
a a
lu management, independent of the investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for  lu
e e
reporting the results of these policies. For fair values determined by reference to external quotation or evidenced pricing parameters, 
independent price determination or validation is utilized to corroborate those inputs. Further details of the validation processes are 
set out below.
Valuation of assets and liabilities is based on a pricing hierarchy, in order to maintain a controlled process that will systematically 
F promote the use of prices from sources in which Aegon has the most confidence, where the least amount of manual intervention exists  F
in in
an and to embed consistency in the selection of price sources. Depending on asset type the pricing hierarchy consists of a waterfall that  an
c c
ia starts with making use of market prices from indices and follows with making use of third-party pricing services or brokers. ia

During 2020, Aegon transferred certain financial instruments from Level II to Level III of the fair value hierarchy. The reason for 
O O

Fair value measurement
A
The description of Aegon's methods of determining fair value and the valuation techniques are described on the following pages. t a
 g
la
n
Shares c
e
When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its investments in shares. For Level 
III unquoted shares, the net asset value can be considered the best approximation to the fair value. Net asset value is the value of an 
entity's assets minus the value of its liabilities and may be the same as the book value or the equity value of the entity.  
Also for unquoted shares, the fair value may be estimated using other methods, such as observations of the price/earnings or price/
cash flow ratios of quoted companies considered comparable to the companies being valued. Valuations are adjusted to account for 
company-specific issues and the lack of liquidity inherent in an unquoted investment. Adjustments for lack of liquidity are generally 
based on available market evidence. In addition, a variety of other factors are reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, 
current operating performance, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment. 
V
a
Available-for-sale shares include shares in a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) for an amount of EUR 93 million (2019: EUR 91 million),  lue
 c
which are reported as part of the line-item Net asset value. A FHLB has implicit financial support from the United States government.  re
a
The redemption value of the shares is fixed at par and they can only be redeemed by the FHLB. tio
n
Debt securities
The fair values of debt securities are determined by management after taking into consideration several sources of data. When 
available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its debt securities. As stated previously, 
Aegon’s valuation policy utilizes a pricing hierarchy which dictates that publicly available prices are initially sought from indices and 
third-party pricing services. In the event that pricing is not available from these sources, those securities are submitted to brokers 
to obtain quotes, the majority of which are non-binding. As part of the pricing process, Aegon assesses the appropriateness of each  C
quote (i.e. as to whether the quote is based on observable market transactions or not) to determine the most appropriate estimate  rea
t
of fair value. in
g
 s
u
s
When broker quotes are not available, securities are priced using internal cash flow modeling techniques. These valuation  ta
in
methodologies commonly use the following inputs: reported trades, bids, offers, issuer spreads, benchmark yields, estimated  ab
le
prepayment speeds, issue specific credit adjustments, indicative quotes from market makers and/or estimated cash flows.  v
a
lu
e
To understand the valuation methodologies used by third-party pricing services Aegon reviews and monitors the applicable 
methodology documents of the third-party pricing services. Any changes to their methodologies are noted and reviewed for 
reasonableness. In addition, Aegon performs in-depth reviews of prices received from third-party pricing services on a sample basis. 
The objective for such reviews is to demonstrate that Aegon can corroborate detailed information such as assumptions, inputs and 
methodologies used in pricing individual securities against documented pricing methodologies. Only third-party pricing services and 
brokers with a substantial presence in the market and with appropriate experience and expertise are used. F
in
a
n
c
Third-party pricing services will often determine prices using recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. The third-party  ia
pricing service makes adjustments for the elapsed time from the trade date to the reporting date to take into account available market  l inf
o
information. Lacking recently reported trades, third-party pricing services and brokers will use modeling techniques to determine  rm
a
a security price where expected future cash flows are developed based on the performance of the underlying collateral and discounted  tio
n
using an estimated market rate.
Periodically, Aegon performs an analysis of the inputs obtained from third-party pricing services and brokers to ensure that the inputs 
are reasonable and produce a reasonable estimate of fair value. Aegon’s asset specialists and investment valuation specialists consider 
both qualitative and quantitative factors as part of this analysis. Several examples of analytical procedures performed include, but are 
O
not limited to, recent transactional activity for similar debt securities, review of pricing statistics and trends and consideration of recent  th
e
relevant market events. Other controls and procedures over pricing received from indices, third-party pricing services, or brokers include  r n
o
validation checks such as exception reports which highlight significant price changes, stale prices or unpriced securities. Additionally,  n
-
f
Aegon performs back testing on a sample basis. Back testing involves selecting a sample of securities trades and comparing the prices  in
a
n
in those transactions to prices used for financial reporting. Significant variances between the price used for financial reporting and  c
ia
the transaction price are investigated to explain the cause of the difference. l in
f
o
rm
Credit ratings are also an important consideration in the valuation of securities and are included in the internal process for determining  a
t
Aegon’s view of the risk associated with each security. However, Aegon does not rely solely on external credit ratings and there is an  ion
internal process, based on market observable inputs, for determining Aegon’s view of the risks associated with each security.
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
298 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 44 299
Aegon’s portfolio of private placement securities (held at fair value under the classification of available-for-sale or fair value through 
A A
t a profit or loss) is valued using a matrix pricing methodology. The pricing matrix is obtained from a third-party service provider and  t a
 g  g
la indicates current spreads for securities based on weighted average life, credit rating, and industry sector. Each month, Aegon’s asset  la
n n
c specialists review the matrix to ensure the spreads are reasonable by comparing them to observed spreads for similar bonds traded  c
e e
in the market. Other inputs to the valuation include coupon rate, the current interest rate curve used for discounting and a liquidity 
premium to account for the illiquid nature of these securities. The liquidity premiums are determined based upon the pricing of recent 
transactions in the private placements market; comparing the value of the privately offered security to a similar public security. 
The impact of the liquidity premium for private placement securities to the overall valuation is insignificant.
Aegon's portfolio of debt securities can be subdivided into Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), Commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS), Asset-backed securities (ABS), Corporate bonds and Government debt. Below relevant details of the valuation 
methodologies for these specific types of debt securities are described.
V V
a a
lue Residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities lue
 c  c
re Valuations of RMBS, CMBS and ABS are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. Valuations per asset type are based on a pricing  re
a a
tio hierarchy which uses a waterfall approach that starts with market prices from indices and follows with third-party pricing services  tio
n n
or brokers. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibilities of corroboration of the market prices. If no market prices are available, 
Aegon uses internal models to determine fair value. Significant inputs included in the internal models are generally determined based 
on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Market standard 
models may be used to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. The most significant 
unobservable input is the liquidity premium which is embedded in the discount rate.
C Corporate bonds C
rea Valuations of corporate bonds are monitored and reviewed on a monthly basis. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibility  rea
t t
in of corroboration of market prices when available. If no market prices are available, valuations are determined by a discounted cash  in
g g
 su flow methodology using an internally calculated yield. The yield is comprised of a credit spread over a given benchmark. In all cases   su
s s
ta the benchmark is an observable input. The credit spread contains both observable and unobservable inputs. Aegon starts by taking  ta
in in
ab an observable credit spread from a similar bond of the given issuer, and then adjust this spread based on unobservable inputs. These  ab
le le
 v unobservable inputs may include subordination, liquidity and maturity differences. The weighted average credit spread used in valuation   v
a a
lu of corporate bonds has decreased to 2.4% (December 31, 2019: 2.5%). lu
e e
Government debt
When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its government debt investments. 
When Aegon cannot make use of quoted market prices, market prices from indices or quotes from third-party pricing services 
or brokers are used.

Tax credit investments
The Level III fair value of tax credit investments is determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique. This valuation 
technique takes into consideration projections of future capital contributions and distributions, as well as future tax credits and 
the tax benefits of future operating losses. The present value of these cash flows is calculated by applying a discount rate. In general, 
the discount rate is determined based on the cash outflows for the investments and the cash inflows from the tax credits and/or tax

Mortgage loans, policy loans and private loans (held at amortized cost)
A
For private loans, fixed interest mortgage loans and other loans originated by the Group, the fair value used for disclosure purposes  t a
 g
is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to financial instruments with similar  la
n
yield and maturity characteristics. For fixed interest mortgage loans, the market rate is adjusted for expenses, prepayment rates, lapse  c
e
assumptions (unobservable inputs), liquidity and credit risk (market observable inputs). An increase in expense spread, prepayment 
rates and/or prepayment assumptions, would decrease the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio.
The fair value of floating interest rate mortgage loans, policy loans and private placements used for disclosure purposes is assumed 
to be approximated by their carrying amount, adjusted for changes in credit risk. Credit risk adjustments are based on market 
observable credit spreads if available, or management’s estimate if not market observable.
Derivatives
Where quoted market prices are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied.  V
a
The valuation techniques incorporate all factors that a typical market participant would consider and are based on observable market  lue
 c
data when available. Models are validated before they are used and calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual experience and  re
a
comparable market prices. tio
n
Fair values for exchange-traded derivatives, principally futures and certain options, are based on quoted market prices in active 
markets. Fair values for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments represent amounts estimated to be received from 
or paid to a third party in settlement of these instruments. These derivatives are valued using pricing models based on the net present 
value of estimated future cash flows, directly observed prices from exchange-traded derivatives, other OTC trades, or external pricing 
services. Most valuations are derived from swap and volatility matrices, which are constructed for applicable indices and currencies 
using current market data from many industry standard sources. Option pricing is based on industry standard valuation models and  C
current market levels, where applicable. The pricing of complex or illiquid instruments is based on internal models or an independent  rea
t
third party. For long-dated illiquid contracts, extrapolation methods are applied to observed market data in order to estimate inputs  in
g
and assumptions that are not directly observable. To value OTC derivatives, management uses observed market information, other   su
s
trades in the market and dealer prices. ta
in
a
b
le
Some OTC derivatives are so-called longevity derivatives. The payout of longevity derivatives is linked to publicly available mortality   v
a
tables. The derivatives are measured using the present value of the best estimate of expected payouts of the derivative plus a risk  lu
e
margin. The best estimate of expected payouts is determined using best estimate of mortality developments. Aegon determined 
the risk margin by stressing the best estimate mortality developments to quantify the risk and applying a cost-of-capital methodology. 
Depending on the duration of the longevity swaps either the projected mortality development or discount rate are the most significant 
unobservable inputs.
Aegon normally mitigates counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements where practical and  F
in
in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the Group’s legal entities to facilitate Aegon’s right to offset credit risk exposure.  an
c
Changes in the fair value of derivatives attributable to changes in counterparty credit risk were not significant. ia

f
o
Embedded derivatives in insurance contracts including guarantees rm
a
Bifurcated guarantees for minimum benefits in insurance and investment contracts are carried at fair value. These guarantees include  tio
n
Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) in the United States and United Kingdom which are offered on some variable 
annuity products and are also assumed from a ceding company; minimum investment return guarantees on insurance products offered 
in the Netherlands, including group pension and traditional products; variable annuities sold in Europe.
Since the price of these guarantees is not quoted in any market, the fair values of these guarantees are based on discounted cash flows 
O
calculated as the present value of future expected payments to policyholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable  th
e
to the guarantees. Given the complexity and long-term nature of these guarantees which are unlike instruments available in financial  r n
o
markets, their fair values are determined by using stochastic models under a variety of market return scenarios. A variety of factors  n
-
f
are considered, including own credit spread, expected market rates of return, equity and interest rate volatility, correlations of market  in
a
n
returns, discount rates and actuarial assumptions. The most significant unobservable factor is own credit spread. The weighted average  c
ia
own credit spread used in the valuations of embedded derivatives in insurance contracts increased to 0.25% (2019: 0.24%). l in
f
o
rm
The expected returns are based on risk-free rates. Aegon added a premium to reflect the credit spread as required. The credit spread  a
t
is set by using the Credit default swap (CDS) spreads of a reference portfolio of life insurance companies (including Aegon), adjusted  ion
to reflect the subordination of senior debt holders at the holding company level to the position of policyholders at the operating

 g  g
la la
n n
c Aegon extrapolates yield curves beyond market observable maturities. The discount rates converge linearly in 10 years to an Ultimate  c
e e
Forward Rate. In the Netherlands, the ultimate forward rate is 3.65% from the last liquid point. In 2020, Aegon changed its ultimate 
forward rate in the US from 4.25% to 3.55%. The uniform last liquid point for all Aegon’s major currencies (EUR, USD and GBP) is set 
at 30 years.
Since many of the assumptions are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation, the liability 
included in future policy benefits has been reflected within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to note 36 Guarantees in insurance 
contracts for more details about Aegon’s guarantees.

re appraisers at least every three to five years and reviewed at least once a year by qualified internal appraisers to ensure the value  re
a a
tio correctly reflects the fair value at the reporting date. Appraisals are different for each specific local market, but are based on market  tio
n n
guidelines such as International Valuation Standards, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice or guidelines issued 
by the Investment Property Databank. Valuations are mostly based on active market prices, adjusted for any difference in the nature, 
location or condition of the specific property. If such information is not available, other valuation methods are applied, considering 
the value that the property’s net earning power will support, the value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties and 
the current cost of reproducing or replacing the property. Discount rates used in the valuation of real estate reflect the risk embedded 
in the projected cash flows for the asset being valued. Capitalization rates represent the income rate for a real estate property that 
C reflects the relationship between a single year’s net operating income expectancy and the total property price or value. For property  C

The preferred method of obtaining the fair value of the fair value option bonds is the quoted price (Level I). In case markets are less

quality adjustments. Aegon uses a discounted cash flow method including yield curves such as deposit rates, floating rates, 3-month 
swap rates, and the US Treasury yield curve. In addition, Aegon includes own credit spread based on Aegon’s credit default swap

in the income statement. The Group has elected to designate the investments backing those liabilities at fair value through profit   v
a
or loss, as a classification of available-for-sale would result in accumulation of unrealized gains and losses in a revaluation reserve  lu
e
within equity whilst changes to the liability would be reflected in net income (accounting mismatch).
Investments for account of policyholders
Investments held for account of policyholders comprise assets that are linked to various insurance and investment contracts for 
which the financial risks are borne by the customer. Under the Group’s accounting policies these insurance and investment liabilities 
are measured at the fair value of the linked assets with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement. To avoid  F
in
an accounting mismatch the linked assets have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss.  an
c
ia
In addition, the investment for account of policyholders include with profit assets, where Aegon manages these assets together with  l inf
o
related liabilities on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented policy of asset and liability management. In accordance with  rm
a
the Group’s accounting policies, these assets have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss. tio

Investment contracts for account of policyholders
With the exception of the financial liabilities with discretionary participating features that are not subject to the classification and 
measurement requirements for financial instruments, all investment contracts for account of policyholders that are carried at fair value

Legal and arbitration proceedings, regulatory investigations and actions
Aegon faces significant risks of litigation as well as regulatory investigations and actions relating to its and its subsidiaries’ businesses 
as well as Aegon’s compliance with regulations applicable to it as a corporate entity.
Due to the geographic spread of its business, Aegon Group may be subject to tax audits or litigation in various jurisdictions. Although 
uncertainties are provided for adequately in the tax position, the ultimate outcome of the tax audits of litigation may result in an 
C outcome that differs from the amounts provided for. C
re re
a a
t t
in Insurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely subject to litigation, investigation and regulatory activity  in
g g
 su by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions   su
s s
ta in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. These actions may  ta
in in
ab involve issues including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes;  ab
le le
 v investment returns; sales practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial costs, ongoing   v
a a
lu costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change related matters;  lu
e e
competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; intellectual property; and anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and 
economic sanctions compliance.
Government and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive or other proceedings and/
or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary 
F amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business  F
in in
an practices in response to inquiries. an
c c
ia ia
l inf Customers of certain Aegon products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products, which are affected  l inf
o o
rm by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile or change  rm
a a
tio due to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon. Disputes and  tio
n n
investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements including payments or changes 
to business practices even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit. 
The existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining 
the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon 
O O
th becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated, it may  th

Proceedings in which Aegon is involved
Several US insurers, including Aegon subsidiaries, have been named in class actions as well as individual litigation relating to increases 
in monthly deduction rates (''MDR'') on universal life products. Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup 
past losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon's subsidiary in the US has agreed to settle 
two such class actions that had been venued in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first 
case, approved in January 2019,arose from increases implemented in 2015-2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated 
in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represent approximately 43% of the value 
of the settlement fund. The individual opt-out cases and disputes are ongoing. Resolution of this class action ended a number of other 
related cases, including other federal and state class actions. In the second case, Aegon’s subsidiary agreed to settle a class action  V
a
lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement on September 16, 2020. Opt-outs in this  lue
 c
case represent less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. On October 15, 2020, two opt-out policyholders whose objections  re
a
to the settlement were overruled by the trial court filed an appeal. The appeal has delayed implementation of the settlement.  tio
n
The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs, although Aegon continues to hold a provision for these policyholders. 
In the only individual case against Aegon’s subsidiary to reach trial (in 2017), a jury found that a 2013 increase to a certain group 
of policies was improper. The jury verdict was affirmed on appeal, which ended the case. At this time it is impracticable for Aegon 
to quantify a range or maximum liability or the timing of the financial impact, if any, of the remaining MDR increase related litigation, 
as the potential financial impacts are dependent both on the outcomes of court proceedings and future developments in financial 
markets and mortality. If decided adversely to Aegon, these claims could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results 
of operations, and financial position. C
re
a
t
Unclaimed property administrators and state insurance regulators performed examinations and multi-state examinations of the life  in
g
insurance industry in the United States, including certain of Aegon's subsidiaries. Aegon subsidiaries, like other major US insurers,   su
s
entered into resolutions with state treasurers and insurance regulators regarding unclaimed property and claims settlement practices.  ta
in
As of December 2020, there remained a provision of USD 6 million for unclaimed property obligations, which is management's best  ab
le
estimate of the still-outstanding exposure. The final amount may vary based on subsequent regulatory review.  v
a
lu
e
Aegon’s US-based subsidiaries may face employment-related lawsuits from time to time. For example, several US-based Aegon 
subsidiaries have been named in a class action alleging that the business model for a part of the business inappropriately characterizes 
distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, these lawsuits, along with similar claims 
against other companies and regulatory action could result in significant settlements or judgments, and could necessitate a change 
in the distribution model, which would be costly and could have a material impact on the financial results for that part of the Aegon 
US business. F

A former subsidiary of Transamerica Corporation was involved in a contractual dispute with a Nigerian travel broker that arose in 1976.  ia
That dispute was resolved in Delaware court for USD 235 thousand plus interest in 2010. The plaintiff took the Delaware judgment  l inf
o
relating to the 1976 dispute to a Nigerian court and alleged that it was entitled to approximately the same damages for 1977 through  rm
a
1984 despite the absence of any contract relating to those years. The Nigerian trial court issued a judgment in favor of the plaintiff  tio
n
of the alleged actual damages as well as pre-judgment interest of approximately USD 120 million. On appeal this decision was reversed 
on procedural grounds and remanded back to the trial court which ruled to dismiss the case; however, the Plaintiff appealed the trial 
court’s ruling. The appeal is still pending. Aegon has no material assets located in Nigeria.
In Poland, owners of unit-linked policies continue to file claims in civil court against Aegon over fees payable upon purchase 
O
or surrender of the product. Plaintiffs claim that these fees are not contractually supported. Aegon faces a significant number of these  th
e
cases. For reasons of commercial necessity as well as at the instigation of the regulatory authorities, Aegon decided to modify the fee  r n
o
structure. As of 2020, a provision of EUR 10 million remains, which represents management's best estimate of the exposure. The final  n
-
f
amount may vary based on regulatory developments and the outcome of litigation. in

In the Netherlands, unit linked products ('beleggingsverzekeringen') have been controversial and the target of litigation since at least  l in
f
2005. Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups  o
rm
have formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been  a
t
involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product  ion
lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
306 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 46 307
future policy costs for the large majority of its unit-linked portfolio. Some of the unit linked products are still involved in ongoing 
A A
t a litigation. In September 2014, consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a claim against Aegon in court. The claim  t a
 g  g
la related to a range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation.  la
n n
c The claim challenges a variety of elements of these products, on multiple legal grounds, including allegations made previously. In June  c
e e
2017 (and revised in December 2017), the court issued a verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated 
according to the standards at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis.
nl were dismissed under this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a limited 
set of policies. The district court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation 
arrangements provide sufficient compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed 
the proceedings and indicated to decide on March 30, 2021 on the continuation of the proceedings. Aegon expects the claims and 
litigation on unit linked products to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against other Dutch insurers 
currently before regulators and courts may also affect Aegon. At this time, Aegon is unable to estimate the range or potential 
V maximum liability. There can be no assurances that these matters, in the aggregate, will not ultimately result in a material adverse  V
a a
lue effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position. lue
 c  c
re re
a a
tio Securities leasing products ('aandelenlease producten') have also been the subject of litigation in the Netherlands. Although sales  tio
n n
of securities leasing products ended more than a decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced. In 2016, the Dutch 
Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a securities leasing product sold by one of Aegon's competitors. It decided that the financial 
institution was liable if a broker ('remisier') that advised on the sale of the institution's products was not properly licensed. In July 
2016, consumer interest group Stichting Platform Aandelenlease filed a claim against Aegon Bank regarding securities leasing product 
Sprintplan. In October 2017, the district court of The Hague ruled in favor of Aegon that the Sprintplan liability had been conclusively 
determined in earlier proceedings and there were no grounds to hold further collective proceedings. The plaintiff appealed. In February 
C 2020, the Court of Appeal rejected all claims filed by Platform Aandelenlease against Aegon Bank. This ruling has become final. C
re re
a a
t t
in In the Netherlands, Aegon is also involved in claims for compensation and the cancellation or nullification of contracts concerning  in
g g
 su the Vliegwiel product, a variation on securities leasing products. Currently, proceedings are pending before the Dutch courts and   su
s s
ta the Financial Services Complaints Authority (‘Klachteninstituut Financiële Dienstverlening’), with numerous cases having been initiated  ta
in in
ab by Leaseproces B.V. In December 2020 Aegon reached an agreement on a settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for those customers with  ab
le le
 v Vliegwiel and Sprintplan products who are represented by Leaseproces B.V. The settlement is subject to conditions precedent and   v
a a
lu further operational details have yet to be agreed. Execution of the settlement is expected in 2021. Aegon has taken a provision for  lu
e e
the settlement. However, the outcome of the settlement and any (potential) legal proceedings in relation to Vliegwiel and Sprintplan 
products is uncertain, and therefore Aegon is unable to estimate a potential maximum liability at this time. There can be no assurances 
that this matter will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.

agreement signed on July 3, 2018 between Aegon and Banco Santander to expand their life and non-life insurance partnership, following  n
-
f
Banco Santander’s acquisition of Banco Popular. Aegon’s insurance joint ventures with Banco Santander in Spain completed the acquisition  in
a
n
of the in force term life policies previously sold through Banco Popular branches as well as the right to write new term life and selected  c
ia
lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander. The transaction was closed  l in
f
following satisfaction of all closing conditions, including the termination of existing alliances of Banco Popular. For its 51% stake in the  o
rm
expansion of the joint venture with Banco Santander, Aegon paid an upfront amount of EUR 187 million – lower than the EUR 215 million  a
t
communicated in July 2018 mainly due to the results of the in-force portfolio which accrued to Santander till closing. Furthermore,  ion
the previously agreed contingent payment of up to EUR 75 million is due in 2024, subject to the performance of the partnership.

Our audit approach nc
ia
Overview and context l in
f
Aegon N.V. is a provider of mainly life insurance, pension and asset management services. The Group consists of several components.  o
rm
Aegon’s main operating units are separate legal entities and operate under the laws of their respective countries. Aegon has  a
t
the following reportable segments: Americas, which covers business units in the United States and Brazil, The Netherlands, United  ion
Kingdom, International, which covers business units in Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Asia, Asset Management and Holding. 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
330 Independent auditor’s report 331
Aegon has significant operations in the Americas, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. To be able to obtain sufficient and 
A A
t a appropriate audit evidence over the consolidated financial statements, we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out  t a
 g  g
la in the section ‘The scope of our group audit’. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group and  la
n n
c by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the group financial statements as set out below. c
e e
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
We determined our group materiality based on Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity since we believe that this metric has become the most 
relevant and suitable benchmark to determine our overall materiality, as we have set out in the section ‘Materiality’. In particular, 
we considered where management made important judgments, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
In Note 3 ‘Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies’, the Group describes the areas of judgment 
V in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty and  V
a a
lue the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance  lue
 c  c
re contracts and the valuation of certain Level 3 investments, we considered these matters as key audit matters as set out in the section  re
a a
tio ‘Key audit matters’ of this report. Furthermore, we identified uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation as a key audit matter. tio
n n
In identifying these key audit matters we also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical estimates and assumptions, 
taking into account the estimation uncertainty as a result of the global pandemic. Based on that assessment, the meetings that 
we had with Aegon’s key management in various operating units and procedures we performed during our audit, we identified the risk 
of impairment of assets as a new key audit matter compared to previous year. We refer to the separate section on key audit matters for 
further details.
C C
rea Given the importance of information technology (IT) for the Group and hence for our audit of the financial statements, we have,  rea
t t
in to the extent relevant to our audit, paid specific attention to the IT dependencies and IT general controls, which comprise the policies  in
g g
 su and procedures to ensure reliable automated processing of information used for financial reporting purposes, and relevant   su
s s
ta application controls.  ta
in in
a a
b b
le le
 v We ensured that the audit teams at both group (consolidation) and component level included the appropriate skills and competences   v
a a
lu which are needed for the audit of a complex financial conglomerate, such as Aegon N.V. This includes industry expertise in life and  lu
e e
non-life insurance, banking and asset management. We included experts and specialists in the areas of risk assurance (IT), tax services, 
actuarial services, global human resource services, valuation services for certain types of assets (e.g. complex financial instruments and 
real estate) and forensic experts in our team.

Materiality
A
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section ‘Our responsibilities for  t a
 g
the audit of the financial statements’. la
n
c
e
Based on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality 
for the financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and 
to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and 
on our opinion.
Overall group  EUR 115 million (2019: EUR 83 million).
materiality
V
Basis for determining  We used our professional judgment to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment   a
materiality we used 0.75% of the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity. lue
 c
re
Rationale for benchmark  We used the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity, as disclosed in Note 43 of the financial statements, as the primary  a
t
applied benchmark, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements.  io
n
Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity is defined as IFRS-EU Shareholders’ Equity minus revaluation reserves (i.e. the 
volatile effect of unrealized gains/losses on available for sale investments) plus non-controlling interests and 
long-term incentive plan not yet vested (which are immaterial to the calculation). In previous years we used a 
normalized, 3 years average profit before tax as benchmark for determining our overall materiality. We believe 
that Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity has become a more relevant and suitable benchmark to determine our overall 
materiality due to the increasing focus of stakeholders (e.g. regulators, rating agencies and shareholders) on 
capital generation in combination with the nature of the Group’s business and the volatility of earnings. Adjusted 
Shareholders’ Equity is a key metric to evaluate Aegon’s equity position, which is important for the dividend paying  C
potential of Aegon and gives a relevant indication of the ability of the Group to cover its liabilities.  re
a
t
in
g
We applied professional judgment to determine the percentage to be applied to this metric. In this respect we   s
u
considered the activities of the Group, the balance sheet total, revenue, the underlying result and the result before  s
t
tax. We have set our final materiality based on the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity position at year end which lead  ain
to a small reduction compared to the level determined during planning. ab
le
Component materiality To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgment, allocate materiality that is less than our   va
overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between EUR 15 million and  lue
EUR 100 million. 
We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above EUR 6 million 
(2019: EUR 4 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. F

The scope of our group audit ia
Aegon N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The Group is structured predominantly along geographical lines as described  l inf
o
in Note 5, ‘Segment information’ in the financial statements. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated  rm
a
financial statements of Aegon N.V.  tio
n
 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to 
be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, 
the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components 
of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be 
O
performed at the component level by the Group engagement team and by each component auditor.  th
e
  r n
o
The group audit primarily focused on the significant components: Americas, the Netherlands and United Kingdom. We subjected these  n
-
f
components to audits of their complete financial information, as these components are individually financially significant to the Group.  in
a
n
Additionally, we selected Aegon Spain, Aegon Hungary, two operating entities in Asia and Holding for audit of specified balances  c
ia
to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures for Holding were  l in
f
performed by the Group engagement team.  o
rm
  a
t
In total, in performing these procedures and excluding our group analytical procedures, we achieved the following coverage  ion
on the financial line items:

e e
None of the remaining components represented more than 1% of total Group revenue or total Group assets. For those remaining 
components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatements within those components. 
 
Where component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be 
able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole.

a a
tio that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified (including the risk of fraud), the materiality levels to be applied and  tio
n n
our global audit approach. We also included specific requirements in our instructions to the component auditors to understand and 
address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the risks arising from working in a remote environment. We discussed the risk 
assessment and audit approach with each of the component teams. This particularly concerned the risk of fraud, revenue recognition, 
significant estimates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk assessment. We developed an oversight strategy for 
each component based on its significance and/or risk characteristics to the Group. This strategy included procedures such as regular 
virtual meetings and virtual site visits and discussions with component auditors to challenge and review significant audit matters and 
C judgments including the review of selected working papers via remote access to our component teams audit files. Furthermore, we had  C
rea individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams during the year and upon conclusion of their work. During these calls,  rea
t t

e e
team of the main components. During these meetings, we discussed the business developments, including the impact that 
the COVID-19 pandemic and working in a remote environment had on processes and controls in order to obtain a good understanding 
as a group audit team of the local situation and the local impact of the pandemic. Based on the discussions we had with our component 
teams, the review of their work we performed and the discussions we had with local Aegon management, we assessed that the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working in a remote environment, on the effective operation of controls relevant for our audit was

Our focus on the risk of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations
Our objectives
The objectives of our audit are: 
 
In respect to fraud:
	to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud;
	to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through 
designing and implementing appropriate audit responses; and
	to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. V
a
lu
e
 c
In respect to non-compliance with laws and regulations: re
	to identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements due to non-compliance with laws and  atio
n
regulations; and
	to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error when considering the applicable legal and regulatory framework.
The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations lies with 
the Executive Board with the oversight of the Supervisory Board. We refer to the sections ‘Our business environment’, ‘Non-
financial policies, procedures and outcomes’ and ‘Risk management’ (the last two as part of section ‘Safeguarding value creation’)  C
of the integrated annual report where the Executive Board included their perspectives on the risk of fraud and section ‘Report  rea

Risk of fraud ab
le
As part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud,   v
a
misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated the fraud risk factors  lu
e
to consider and evaluated whether those factors indicated a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We also considered the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on the control environment in our fraud risk assessment. Considering the identified fraud risk indicators, 
the potential risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic such as pressure on earnings and ineffective monitoring of controls 
were already identified. Therefore, we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic and the remote working environment did not lead 
to the identification of additional fraud risk factors. 
  F
in
As in all our audits, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was  an
c
evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We evaluated the design and  ia
the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud  l inf
o
risks, tested high-risk manual journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgments for bias by management, taking into  rm
a
account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We refer to the key  tio
n
audit matter section where we included examples of our approach related to areas of higher risk due to accounting estimates where 
management makes significant judgments. 
 
We have performed an assessment of matters reported on the (Group’s) whistleblowing procedures with the entity and results 
of management’s investigation of such matters.

e e
 
In line with Standard 250 we made in our audit approach a distinction between those laws and regulations which:
	Have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. For this category, in line 
with the requirements as included in Standard 250, we obtained sufficient audit evidence regarding compliance with the provision 
of those laws and regulations; and
	Do not have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, but where 
compliance may be fundamental to the operating aspect of the business, to the Group’s ability to continue its business or to avoid 
material penalties. For this category, we performed specific procedures to identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations 
V that may have a material effect on the financial statements. V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re We identified that the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations relates mainly to the laws and regulations which have  re
a a
tio an indirect impact on the financial statements, such as anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, regulations  tio
n n
linked to the operating licenses for the group’s activities (insurance, asset management, banking) including Solvency II in Europe and 
Risk-Based Capital (RBC) in the US.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive

year. We took the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration in the audit procedures we performed on the existing key audit 
matters. These are described in more detail in the individual key audit matters below. However, given the significance of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, the economic impacts but also the new strategy presented by the Group in December 2020, we gave significant 
additional attention to the risk of impairment of assets, which we included as a separate and new key audit matter compared 
to last year.

Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit  c
e
evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all material 
misstatements. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements 
on our opinion.

The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch 
Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:
	Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing 
and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override 
of internal control.
V 	Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  V
a a
lue circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. lue
 cre 	Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures   cre
a a
tio made by management. tio
n 	Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence  n
obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report and are made 
in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
C to cease to continue as a going concern. C
rea 	Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating  rea
t t
in whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. in
g g
 s  s
u u
s s
ta Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction,  ta
in in
ab supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures  ab
le le
 v for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a   v
a a
lu whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities,  lu
e e
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for 
which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue 
F an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding  F
in in
an statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this  an
c c
ia auditor’s report. ia
l in l in
f f
o o
rm We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,  rm
a a
tio and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and  tio
n n
where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not

The relevant provisions are as follows:
1. The General Meeting of Shareholders will adopt the Annual Accounts;
2. If the adopted profit and loss account shows a profit, the Supervisory Board may decide, upon the proposal of the Executive Board, 
to set aside part of the profit to augment and/or form reserves;
3. The profits remaining after application of 2 above shall be put at the disposal of the General Meeting of Shareholders. The 
Executive Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall make a proposal for that purpose. A proposal to pay a

common shares and 558,910,640 common shares B were held by Vereniging Aegon and 1,061,820 common shares were held 
by Aegon’s subsidiaries.
All of Aegon’s common shares and common shares B are fully paid and not subject to calls for additional payments of any kind. All 
of Aegon’s common shares are registered shares. Holders of shares of New York registry hold their common shares in the registered

Vereniging Aegon
Vereniging Aegon is the continuation of the former mutual insurer AGO. In 1978, AGO demutualized and Vereniging AGO became 
the only shareholder of AGO Holding N.V., which was the holding company for its insurance operations. In 1983, AGO Holding N.V. and 
Ennia N.V. merged into Aegon N.V.. Vereniging AGO initially received approximately 49% of the common shares and all of the preferred 
C shares in Aegon, giving it voting majority in Aegon. At that time, Vereniging AGO changed its name to Vereniging Aegon. C

lu In accordance with the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement, Vereniging Aegon had certain option rights on preferred shares to prevent  lu
e e
dilution of voting power as a result of share issuances by Aegon. This enabled Vereniging Aegon to maintain voting control 
at the General Meeting of Shareholders of Aegon. In September 2002, Aegon effected a capital restructuring whereby Vereniging 
Aegon’s ownership interest in Aegon’s common shares decreased from approximately 37% to approximately 12% and its aggregate 
ownership interest in Aegon’s voting shares decreased from approximately 52% to approximately 33%.
F In May 2003, Aegon’s shareholders approved certain changes to Aegon’s corporate governance structure, introducing a second  F
in in
an class of preferred shares. Both classes of preferred shares had a nominal value of EUR 0.25 each. The voting rights pertaining  an
c c
ia to the preferred shares were adjusted accordingly to 25/12 vote per preferred share. However, in May 2003, Aegon and Vereniging  ia
l inf Aegon also entered into a Preferred Shares Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Vereniging Aegon agreed to exercise one vote only  l inf
o o
rm per preferred share, except in the event of a 'Special Cause', as defined below. At that time Aegon and Vereniging Aegon amended  rm
a a
tio the option arrangements under the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement so that, in the event of an issuance of shares by Aegon,  tio
n n
Vereniging Aegon could purchase as many class B preferred shares as would enable Vereniging Aegon to prevent or correct dilution 
to below its actual percentage of voting shares, to a maximum of 33%.
On February 15, 2013, Aegon and Vereniging Aegon entered into an agreement to simplify the capital structure of Aegon and 
to cancel all of Aegon’s preferred shares, of which Vereniging Aegon was the sole owner. The execution of this agreement was

offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal values (EUR 0.12). The amended Voting Rights Agreement ensures that

the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon, a tender offer for Aegon shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group  c

of persons, whether individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. 
If, in its sole discretion, Vereniging Aegon determines that a Special Cause has occurred, Vereniging Aegon will notify the General 
Meeting of Shareholders and retain its right to exercise the full voting power of one vote per common share B for a limited period 
of six months.
The simplified capital structure also included an amendment to the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement between Aegon and Vereniging 
Aegon. Following this 2013 amendment, Vereniging Aegon’s call option relates to common shares B. Vereniging Aegon may exercise 
its call option to keep or restore its total stake at 32.6%, irrespective of the circumstances which cause the total shareholding to be 
or become lower than 32.6%. V

Overview of product lines
A A
t a Life t a
 g  g
la Aegon USA offers a comprehensive portfolio of protection solutions to customers in a broad range of market segments. Life products  la
n n
c include term life (TL), universal life (UL), variable universal life (VUL), index universal life (IUL), and whole life insurance (WL). c
e e
Term life insurance
TL insurance provides protection for a stated period of time. Benefits are paid to policy beneficiaries in the event of the death 
of the insured during a specified period. Living benefit riders that provide accelerated benefits for critical illnesses or chronic conditions 
are available on term insurance.
Universal life insurance
UL insurance is flexible permanent life insurance that offers death benefit protection together with the potential for cash value 
V accumulation. After the first few years, there is usually no set premium. The policyholder can adjust the frequency and amount  V
a a
lue of premium payments, as long as sufficient premiums are accumulated in the policy’s account value to cover charges in the month that  lue
 c  c
re follows, which are called 'monthly deductions'. Any changes in the monthly deduction rate reflect Aegon USA's current expectations  re
a a
tio with respect to future policy performance. At any time, the policy owner can see the maximum monthly deduction rate that can  tio
n n
be charged. Some versions of this product have 'secondary guarantees.' These maintain life insurance coverage when the cash value 
is insufficient, as long as the customer pays a specified minimum premium.
Variable universal life insurance
VUL insurance is permanent life insurance that offers both a death benefit and cash value accumulation potential with financial 
market participation. The premium amount for VUL insurance is flexible and may be changed by the policyholder within contract limits. 
C Coverage amounts may change as well. The investment feature usually includes 'sub-accounts,' which provide exposure to investments,  C
rea such as stocks and bonds. This exposure increases cash value return potential, but also the risk of additional premium requirements  rea
t t
in or lower coverage amounts in comparison with a traditional, non-variable life insurance policy. Aegon USA did not actively market VUL  in
g g
 su insurance in 2020 but may do so in the future.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab Index universal life insurance ab
le le
 v IUL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection and cash value accumulation with flexible premium payments. What   v
a a
lu distinguishes it from other types of permanent life insurance is the way in which interest earnings are credited. Net premiums may  lu
e e
be allocated to either a fixed account or indexed accounts. Indexed accounts credit interest based in part on the performance of one 
or more market indices. The credited interest is based on the index, but with a floor and a cap. IUL offers both market-paced growth 
potential in the indexed accounts and downside protection. It is an alternative to traditional UL – for which interest is credited at a fixed 
rate – and VUL, in which the cash value is directly exposed to market fluctuations. LTC riders and other living benefit riders are available. 
F Whole life insurance F
in in
an WL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection provided that the required premiums are paid, while accumulating cash  an
c c
ia values based on statutory requirements. Premiums are generally fixed and usually payable over the life of the policy. Final Expense  ia
l inf WL provides coverage for funeral and burial related costs. l inf
o o
rm rm
a a
tio Accident & Health tio
n n
Aegon USA offers supplemental health insurance and LTC insurance. 
Supplemental health insurance
Supplemental health insurance products include accidental death and dismemberment, accidental injury, cancer, critical illness, 
disability, hospital indemnity, Medicare Supplement, retiree medical, dental, vision, and supplemental medical expense indemnity. 
O O
th Disability and vision are third-party products. th
e e
r n r n
o o
n A number of these products provide policyholders with lump sums or specified payments if these policyholders are hospitalized, injured,  n

in or diagnosed with a critical illness. Others pay benefits for specific medical expenses and treatments, or cover deductibles, co-payments  in
a a
n n

Long-term care insurance
A
LTC insurance products are a category of health insurance and provide benefits to policyholders that require qualified LTC services  t a
 g
when they are unable to perform two or more specified activities of daily living or develop a severe cognitive impairment. LTC insurance  la
n
helps protect against the high cost of LTC services, and it may also help families better manage the financial, health and safety issues  c
e
associated with LTC. Aegon USA’s LTC product is offered as a rider to certain life insurance products and as a standalone product. 
Aegon USA has made the decision to stop new sales of these products and intends to cease such sales in the first quarter of 2021.
Mutual Funds and ETFs
Mutual funds are professionally managed investment vehicles comprised of pooled money invested by numerous individuals 
or institutions. Such funds are invested in various underlying security types such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other 
securities. Aegon USA offers mutual funds that are focused on several different asset classes, including US equity, global/international 
equity, fixed income, money markets and alternative investments, as well as asset allocation and target-date funds with combined 
equity and fixed income strategies. Aegon USA mutual funds utilize the portfolio management expertise of asset managers across  V
a
the industry in a sub-advised platform, using managers both affiliated with and not affiliated with Aegon. These managers are subject  lue
 c
to a rigorous selection and monitoring due diligence process conducted by Transamerica Asset Management. re
a
t
io
n
ETFs are a pooled investment vehicle for individual and institutional investors that combine some of the features of a mutual fund with 
the flexibility of allowing investors to trade throughout the day on an exchange. Aegon USA offers a suite of managed-risk passive 
ETFs that seek to track the S&P Managed Risk 2.0 Indices marketed under the name DeltaShares. This Managed Risk strategy is applied 
to US Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, International Developed Equity and Emerging Market Equity Indices.
Variable Annuities
VAs allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market  C
performance. Additional insurance guarantees, which are offered through riders, can be added to VAs, including guaranteed minimum  rea
t
death benefits (GMDBs) and guaranteed living benefits (GLBs). GMDBs provide a guaranteed benefit in the event of death. GLBs are  in
g
intended to provide a measure of protection against market risk while the annuitant is alive. Different forms of GLBs are offered, such   su
s
as guaranteeing an income stream for life and/or guaranteeing principal protection. Aegon USA will cease new sales of traditional VAs  ta
in
with interest rate-sensitive living and death benefit riders in the first quarter of 2021. ab
le
 v
a
Fixed Annuities lu
e
Fixed annuities allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a tax-deferred basis through periodic interest crediting 
and principal protection. Aegon USA has de-emphasized traditional fixed deferred annuities and is only marketing new sales through 
the Transamerica Advice Center (TAC). The traditional fixed deferred annuity book is, according to plan, continuing to reduce over time. 
Aegon USA historically offered a fixed-index annuity that may credit interest based, in part, on the percentage change in the value 
of the selected index account option(s) at the start and end of the crediting period. A fixed account option was also available. 
Additional guarantees, which were offered through riders, can be added to fixed-index annuities, including GLBs. Aegon USA will cease  F
in
new sales of fixed indexed annuities in the first quarter of 2021. an
c
ia
Retirement Plans and IRAs l inf
o
Comprehensive and customized retirement plan services are offered to employers across the entire range of defined benefit, defined  rm
a
contribution, non-qualified deferred compensation, and multiple employer plans (MEPs). Services are also offered to individuals rolling  tio
n
over funds from other qualified retirement funds or IRAs.
Retirement plan services, including administration, recordkeeping and related services are offered to employers of all sizes and to plans 
across all market segments. Aegon USA also works closely with plan advisors and third-party administrators to serve their customers.

Stable Value Solutions
Aegon USA’s Stable Value Solutions business offers synthetic guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) primarily to tax-qualified 
institutional entities such as 401(k) plans and other retirement plans and college savings plans. A synthetic GIC 'wrapper' is offered 
around fixed income invested assets, which are owned by the plan and managed by the plan or a third-party money manager hired 
by the plan. A synthetic GIC is typically issued with an evergreen maturity and may be terminated under certain conditions. Such 
V a contract helps to reduce fluctuations in the value of the wrapped assets and provides book value withdrawals for plan participants. V

Regulation and supervision c
e
Aegon USA's insurance companies and the business they conduct in the United States are regulated primarily at the state level, 
as supervised by various state insurance regulators. Some activities, products and services are also subject to federal regulation.
State insurance regulation
The Aegon USA insurance companies are licensed as insurers and are regulated in each US state and jurisdiction in which they conduct 
insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies but has a shared purpose in terms of the protection of policy and contract 
holders. The insurance regulators in each state carry out their mission by providing oversight in the broad areas of market conduct and 
financial solvency regulation.
V
a
Aegon USA's largest insurance company is domiciled in the State of Iowa, and the Iowa Insurance Division exercises principal regulatory  lue
 c
jurisdiction over it. This regulation includes implementation and enforcement of standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves and  re
a
capital, and reinsurance. The state of Iowa is Aegon USA’s designated lead state, giving Iowa a coordinating role in the collective  tio
n
supervision of Aegon USA’s insurance entities.
In the areas of licensing and market conduct, states grant or revoke licenses to transact insurance business, regulate trade, advertising 
and marketing practices, approve policy forms and certain premium rates, review and approve products and certain rates prior to sale, 
address consumer complaints, and perform market conduct examinations on both a regular and targeted basis.
In the area of financial regulation, state regulators implement and supervise statutory reserve and capital requirements, including  C
minimum risk-based capital solvency standards. Insurance companies are also subject to extensive reporting, investment limitations,  rea
t
and required approval of significant transactions. State regulators, by law, conduct extensive financial examinations every three  in
g
to five years.   su
s
t
a
in
State regulators have the authority to impose a variety of corrective measures, including revoking licenses, for failure to comply with  ab
le
applicable regulations. All state insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC),   v
a
a non-regulatory industry association that works to achieve uniformity and efficiency of insurance regulation across the United States  lu
e
and US territories.
U.S. state regulators have recently updated certain prudential requirements. The solvency framework for variable annuities was 
updated to better reflect risks and hedging activities. Aegon USA adopted the new framework in 2019 for most legal entities and 
in 2020 for a legal entity domiciled in New York. Aegon USA is also subject to principle-based reserving requirements for life insurance, 
which were implemented for a block of term insurance in 2017 (during the three year transition period) and for all new business  F
in
on January 1, 2020. an
c
ia
Emerging state issues that may impact Aegon USA include a project by the NAIC to develop macroprudential measures and  l inf
o
NAIC projects to update capital charges for asset default risk, mortality risk and longevity risk that could impact required capital.  rm
a
The NAIC is also finalizing a group capital measure that could be applied, at the discretion of the Iowa Insurance Division, to Aegon  tio
n
USA’s insurance operations.
In 2017, the NAIC approved amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act. Among other things, 
the amendments (where adopted) bring health maintenance organizations (HMO) into the life and health guaranty association system 
and adjust guaranty fund assessments for future LTC-related insolvencies so that 50% of such assessments will come from life/annuity 
O
accounts, with the other 50% from the combined health/HMO accounts. These amendments must be adopted into law in each state  th
e
before becoming effective in each such state. To date, approximately 20 states have adopted the amended model. r n
o
n
-
f
In February 2020, the NAIC approved an extensive update to its long-standing Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation.  in
a
n
The result is a revised, consumer-focused set of standards and practices that elevate consumers’ best interests as the core component  c
ia
of all annuity recommendations and sales. Currently, Iowa and Arizona have passed the revised Suitability in Annuity Transactions  l in
f
Model Regulation, effective January 1, 2021. o

Federal regulation of financial services and health insurance
A A
t a Although the insurance business is primarily regulated at the state level, many federal laws and initiatives impact the insurance sector  t a
 g  g
la in such areas as the regulation of financial services, derivatives, retirement plans, securities products, health care, taxes, information  la
n n
c security and privacy. Regulation of financial services has increased as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, which also created the Federal  c
e e
Insurance Office (FIO) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR). The FIO is authorized to review the insurance market in the United 
States and report to Congress, and the OFR conducts research into financial services, including insurance, in support of such oversight. 
In addition, the FIO is authorized to establish US insurance policy in international matters. 
The Federal Reserve Board also has supervision of systemically important insurers and insurers that own a federally insured bank 
or thrift (Savings & Loan Associations). Aegon USA is not currently subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.
Information security and privacy regulation
V Aegon USA’s businesses are regulated with respect to information security, data breach response, privacy, and data use at both  V
a a
lue the federal and state levels. At the federal level, various Aegon USA companies are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA),  lue
 c  c
re the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among other laws.  re
a a
tio At the state level, Departments of Insurance and Financial Services typically administer a series of privacy and information security  tio
n n
laws and regulations that impact several Aegon USA businesses. Following a series of high profile data breaches and data exploitation 
events at various companies that attracted substantial media attention, numerous US regulators and legislators are currently proposing 
or have already passed additional legal requirements with respect to information security and privacy. These include but are not limited 
to the California Consumer Protection Act and the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Rule. Additional laws and 
regulations with respect to these topics are also anticipated to be promulgated and to go into effect in the coming years.
Securities regulation 
C C
rea Several Aegon USA subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the US Securities and  rea
t t
in Exchange Commission (SEC) and aspects of states' securities and other laws. Variable insurance policies, certain annuity contracts  in
g g
 su and registered investment companies (mutual funds) offered by Aegon USA are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws   su
s s
ta administered by the SEC and aspects of states' securities laws. Certain separate accounts of Aegon USA insurers that offer variable life  ta
in in
ab insurance and certain annuities, and interests under these annuity and insurance policies are registered and subject to SEC regulation.  ab
le le
 v The distribution and sale of variable products, mutual funds, and other securities by affiliate and non-affiliate broker-dealers are   v
a a
lu regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). A number of Aegon USA companies are also registered  lu
e e
as investment advisors and subject to SEC regulation or operate under registrations or exemptions from registration as commodity 
pool operators or Commodities Trading Advisors, regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures 
Association.
Aegon USA also owns or manages other investment vehicles that are exempt from registration but may be subject to other 
F requirements of those laws, such as anti-fraud provisions and the terms of applicable exemptions. F
in in
a a
n n
c c
ia On June 30, 2020, the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI) went into effect. Regulation BI establishes a “best interest”  ia
l inf standard of conduct for broker-dealers and associated persons when making a recommendation to a retail customer and requires them  l inf
o o
rm to clearly identify any potential conflicts of interests with those products. The rule also requires broker-dealers and investment advisors  rm
a a
tio to provide a brief relationship summary, Form CRS, to retail investors. The rule is applicable to certain Aegon USA broker-dealers and  tio
n n
investment advisors. 
In addition, since the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule was vacated, several states have moved forward with developing standard 
of conduct rules and proposals. New York, Nevada, and Massachusetts have enacted best interest rules, and other states, including 
New Jersey, have proposed their own fiduciary regulation. The financial services industry continues to operate under heightened 
O O
th scrutiny and increased regulation in various jurisdictions. Aegon USA, like other businesses in the financial services industry, is routinely  th
e e
r n examined and receives requests for information from the SEC, FINRA, state regulators and others in connection with examinations and  r n
o o
n investigations of its own companies and third-party or unaffiliated insurers, broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies  n
- -
f f
in and service providers relating to certain historical and current practices with respect to these and other matters. Some of those  in
a a
n n
c inquiries have led to investigations, which remain open, or have resulted in fines, corrective actions, or restitution. Aegon USA continues  c
ia ia
l in to cooperate with these regulatory agencies. In certain instances, Aegon USA modified business practices in response to those inquiries  l in
f f

Regulation of retirement plans and IRAs
A
Aegon USA administers and provides recordkeeping, investment and insurance services and products used to fund defined contribution  t a
 g
plans, such as 401(k), 403(b), multiple employer and 457 plans, in addition to defined benefit plans, IRAs, 529 plans and other savings  la
n
vehicles. Aegon USA also administers pension benefits distributed upon termination of defined benefit plans. These products and  c
e
services are generally subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (certain government 
and church plans are exempt from ERISA) and the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) for which 
the US Department of Labor (DOL) and the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) have regulatory jurisdiction, respectively.
The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019, better known as the SECURE Act, was signed into law 
on December 20, 2019. The legislation facilitates the use of MEPs, of which Aegon USA is a leading provider, as well as expands 
the safe harbor for automatic enrollment in plans, and reduces the burden of offering annuities either as an in-plan investment option 
or as the form of distribution from a plan. The SECURE Act expands retirement coverage to long-time, part-time workers and “gig 
economy” workers who may not otherwise have access to tax-deferred retirement savings, as well as increases the age for “required  V
a
minimum distributions” from tax deferred accounts from 70 ½ to 72. The SECURE Act also accelerates distributions from inherited  lue
 c
defined contribution plan accounts and IRAs to offset the cost of the other provisions. Separately, many states have also sought  re
a
to open their plans to non-government workers who do not have access to an employer retirement savings plan.  tio
n
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide over $2 trillion 
in economic relief to address the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Among its many provisions were several allowing 
individuals impacted by COVID-19 to withdraw or borrow funds from their qualified retirement plans without incurring an early 
withdrawal penalty (income taxes on withdrawals would still be owed).
Federal tax treatment of insurance companies and their products and plans
C
Although the insurance business is regulated at state level, the US federal tax treatment of life insurers, life insurance, pension and  rea
t
annuity products is governed by the US federal tax code. Provisions that increase the taxation of life insurers, as well as remove  in
g
or decrease the value of tax incentives for life insurance, pensions and annuity products – considered alone and relative to other   su
s
investment vehicles – have been proposed in prior Administrations’ federal budgets and by the US Congress. These initiatives may also  ta
in
come in the form of regulatory changes, including regulations that could limit the ability of US companies to deduct interest expense  ab
le
on financing provided by a non-US affiliate. Executive Administration budget proposals and legislative proposals must be enacted   v
a
by Congress and signed by the President before they become law. Regulatory proposals are subject to public review and comment.  lu
e
The risk of tax law changes is heightened when additional revenue is sought to reduce the federal deficit or to pay for other tax law 
changes, such as lower tax rates. All such legislative and regulatory proposals have the potential to change the tax obligations of life 
insurers as well as modify the tax incentives for short- and long-term savings products. Such changes, if enacted, would have a direct 
impact on the cost and competitiveness of life insurance, annuity and pension products sold to ensure Americans’ financial and 
retirement security.

 g For over 175 years, Aegon has operated in the Netherlands, where it is a leading   g
la la
n n
ce provider of life insurance and pensions. Aegon the Netherlands employs approximately  ce
3,300 people and is headquartered in The Hague, with main offices in Amsterdam, 
Leeuwarden, and Groningen. 
Organizational structure
Aegon is one of the most widely recognized brands in the Dutch financial services sector. Aegon the Netherlands also operates through 
several other brands, including Knab, TKP Pensioen, and Robidus.
V V

e e
On December 10, 2020, Aegon announced strategic organizational changes beginning in 2021, in which Aegon the Netherlands was 
designated a core market, as well as organizing its business into Financial Assets and Strategic Assets.
The Life activities of Aegon the Netherlands are considered Financial Assets. The focus of these activities is on protecting and 
generating capital and on cost reduction by outsourcing of the servicing of the life-books towards partners. With the exception 
F of immediate pension annuities and indexations of existing group life customers, Aegon the Netherlands no longer accept new  F
in in
an customers as of 2021. an
c c
ia ia
l inf Strategic Assets are the businesses in which Aegon the Netherlands will invest to grow its customer base, improve customer retention,  l inf
o o
rm and margins. Aegon the Netherlands strategically focuses on the following business: Mortgages (Aegon Hypotheken), Banking (Knab /  rm
a a
tio Aegon Bank); and Workplace solutions for employers. The last category consists of the following businesses: Aegon Cappital, TKP  tio
n n
Pensioen, Aegon Schadeverzekering, Robidus and Nedasco.
Overview of sales and distribution channels 
Aegon the Netherlands uses a variety of distribution channels to help customers access the products and services appropriate 
to their needs. All business lines use an intermediary channel, which focuses on independent brokers in different market segments 
O O
th in the Netherlands. In recent years, Aegon the Netherlands began investing heavily in online capabilities to support customers and  th
e e
r n intermediaries, which has enabled us to achieve an enhanced digital self-service experience.  r n
o o
n n
- -
f f
in For the Knab brand, Aegon Bank uses the direct and online channels to help its customers make smart financial decisions. It does  in
a a
n n
c this by giving them a clear overview of their finances, and helps them by proactively offering products and services to assist them  c
ia ia
l in in achieving their financial goals. In 2020, Aegon Bank took the decision that it will migrate all products and customers to the Knab  l in
f f
o brand in 2021. The distribution of the products (under the Knab brand) via intermediaries will continue, but will also be done via direct  o
rm rm
a and online channels. a

Overview of business lines
A
Life t a
 g
Aegon the Netherlands’ Life entity (Aegon Levensverzekering) is considered a closed book and is managed as a Financial Asset. This  la
n
means that the focus is on capital optimization and cost reduction to maximize return on capital. c
e
Pensions 
Interest rates have been low for an extended period of time, creating a shift from Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans to DC pensions 
plans. This year, fundamental changes were made to the Dutch pension system. These include that from 2026 onward, new pension 
accrual is only allowed in DC schemes. As Aegon the Netherlands offers DC schemes through a separate legal entity – Aegon Cappital – 
the consequence for Aegon Levensverzekering is that all of its Group pension products will become closed books.
In anticipation of these changes, Aegon the Netherlands proactively decided to stop offering Group pension DB products to new clients 
in 2021. Renewals of existing contracts are still possible, but only if the renewal facilitates the existing clients in their transition to DC  V
a
no later than 2026. In addition, Aegon Levensverzekering remains open for risk insurance and annuities that are closely linked to DC  lue
 c
schemes. More detail on annuities is provided further below.  re
a
t
io
n
The Group DB products that remain on the balance sheet of Aegon Levensverzekering are as following:
	Separate account group contracts with individually determined asset investment strategies, profit sharing and guarantees;
	DB contracts with profit sharing based on a pre-determined interest rate;
	Traditional variable unit-linked products;
	DB subscriptions; and
	DB contracts without profit sharing.
C
In the list above the last two products were still sold in 2020 while the others were already closed for new clients. In each product  rea
t
group there are also contracts with a future due date, as a result of premiums that are still being paid. In addition, indexations remain  in
g
possible for all of these products, while for some products, additional funds need to be contributed.  su
s
t
a
in
Annuities ab
le
The most actively sold products in this category are simple payout annuities and variable annuities. These products are linked to DC   v
a
schemes in which participants build up their capital and are obliged, by law, to purchase an annuity at the pension date. Participants can  lu
e
choose between a guaranteed annuity – where all risks are borne by Aegon the Netherlands – or a variable annuity without investment 
guarantees, where all risks are borne by the participant. Given that a significant shift has been observed to DC schemes, these annuities 
are a natural driver of growth as they provide a solution for the payout phase. Annuity insurance also includes older products with 
guaranteed interest rates and profit sharing for which no new business is written.
Risk insurance F
in
This category mainly includes the survivor’s pension insurance sold as a rider to DC pension schemes. Premiums are paid  an
c
by the employer and the product pays benefits to the spouse/children in the event of the death of the insured. ia
l in
f
o
Endowment insurance  rm
a
Endowment insurance includes several products that accumulate a cash value. Premiums are paid at inception or over the term  tio
n
of the contract. These products pay benefits on the policy maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. Most policies also pay 
death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract. Death benefits may be stipulated in the policy or depend 
on the gross premiums paid to date. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract. The amount insured 
can be increased as a result of profit sharing, if provided for under the terms and conditions of the product.
O
Minimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of endowment insurance products written, except for universal life products,  th
e
for which premiums are invested solely in equity funds. Older generation products contained a 4% guarantee when sold. In 1999,  r n
o
the guarantee for new products decreased to 3%. In 2013, the guarantee on new products was reduced to 0% and in 2019  n
-
f
the guarantee was ended. The sale of these products ended several years ago. in
a
n
c
ia
Term and whole life insurance  l in
f
Term life insurance pays out death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract. Whole life insurance pays out  o
rm
death benefits in the event of death, regardless of when this occurs. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception  a
t
of the contract and are guaranteed. The amount insured may be adjusted at the request of the policyholder. Term life insurance policies  ion

do not include profit-sharing mechanisms. Part of the whole life insurance portfolio has profit-sharing features, which are based

n n
c Non-life c
e e
Accident and Health 
Aegon the Netherlands offers disability and sick leave products to employers that covers these payments for employees not covered 
by social security, where the employer bears the risk. In addition, for some forms of disability, employers can choose to use the social 
security system to insure these risks or opt out and seek private insurance. Private insurance appeals to employers, as it helps reduce 
absenteeism and disability thanks to better reintegration efforts.
For individuals, Aegon the Netherlands offers a disability product mainly targeted at the growing self-employed market.
V Property and Casualty  V
a a
lue Aegon the Netherlands has focused exclusively on retail lines in general insurance, offering products in the segments of property,  lue
 c  c
re motor, travel, legal assistance, private liability claims, pet insurance, and injury. The ambition for the P&C retail segment is to provide  re
a a
tio the best digital servicing in the Dutch market while building long-lasting relationships with customers and distribution partners.  tio
n n
Through the service concepts, Aegon the Netherlands supports intermediaries with excellent digital processes to help their customers 
in the most optimal way, by stimulating performance at sustainable levels for customers, intermediaries, and the insurer, while also 
protecting the health of the supply chain. In addition to the intermediary market, Aegon the Netherlands has further developed 
digital and online capabilities, especially as the direct market has sustained a sizable share in the overall distribution in the past 
years, especially for the Motor segment. The direct market includes sales via Aegon’s own website and affiliates, as well as through 
C aggregator websites. C

in in
ab and governance would have a unified approach. In 2020, preparations and migration began and is due to be completed in 2021. During  ab

e e
brand. In 2020, the banking arm of Aegon was classified as a Strategic Asset within Aegon the Netherlands and forms the gateway 
to individual retirement solutions. In total, our banking solutions are offered to our 540,000 active Dutch customers and small-scale 
enterprises who bank with us. Knab is a fully online digital bank that went live in 2012.
The Bank focuses on customers whose income and wealth are in the mid-market range and offers both savings and investment 
F products. The main focus of savings is on 'Banksparen' products. 'Banksparen' is a tax-deferred savings product in which cash amounts  F
in in

Aegon Cappital
A
Aegon Cappital is a low-cost provider of DC pension schemes offered through intermediary advisors. Aegon Cappital offers DC pension  t a
 g
schemes in a standardized subscription-based model to small and medium enterprises and customized contracts for medium-to-large  la
n
corporations. The model enables employers to choose from a variety of contribution tables and social security offsets, while remaining  c
e
flexible for regulatory changes, such as changes in pension age or fiscal contribution limits. Savings premiums are invested in life cycle 
funds by Aegon Investment Management B.V..
Aegon Cappital is one of the largest pension premium institutions (‘PPIs’) in the Netherlands and benefits considerably from economies 
of scale. The low interest rate environment, and the fundamental changes of the Dutch pension system as of 2026, will result in a 
continued shift to DC schemes.
PPIs cannot bear any investment or insurance risks on their offerings due to regulatory requirements. The schemes include disability 
or life insurance which are offered by partners Aegon Levensverzekering, Aegon Schadeverzekering and Elips Life AG, and an optional  V
a
guaranteed interest rate during the accumulation phase offered by partner Aegon Levensverzekering. Apart from operational and  lue

TKP Pensioen, Robidus and Nedasco
TKP Pensioen is a top three player in the Dutch market for pension administration. TKP Pensioen administers pension rights for 
several large company and industry pension funds, as well as other pension providers such as a premium pension institution. Their 
clients – 3.8 million participants and 76,000 employers – rely on TKP Pensioen for correct and timely pension payments, and clear 
and accessible pension information and communication, from the mandatory pension statements to customer contact and digital 
customer services.

Competition lu
e
Aegon the Netherlands faces strong competition in all markets from insurers, banks, investment companies and pension funds. Its main 
competitors are Allianz Benelux, ASR and NN Group. 
The company has been a key player in the total life market for many years and was ranked third in 2019 based on gross premium 
income. The life insurance market in the Netherlands comprises pensions and life insurance. The top five life insurance companies 
in the Netherlands by gross premium income accounted for almost 90% of total premium (Individual Life and Pension) income in 2019.  F
in
Aegon the Netherlands is the second largest insurance company in the pensions market. Aegon the Netherlands is one of many insurers  an
c
in the non-life market, where in 2019, ten companies accounted for 80% of the total premium income. In terms of premium income,  ia
Aegon the Netherlands' non-life market share is around 2%, making it the ninth largest company in the market. l inf
o
rm
a
In the mortgage loans market, Aegon the Netherlands held a market share of almost 8% based on new sales in 2019, making  tio
n
it the fifth largest mortgage loan provider in the market. Rabobank, ABN AMRO, and ING Bank are the largest mortgage loan providers 
in the market, but their market share is under pressure, because of a shift to fixed rates for longer periods. Competition is still 
increasing from foreign competitors and capital from pension funds.
Aegon the Netherlands' share is growing in the market for Dutch household savings. In 2019, its market share was more than 3%, 
O
which is relatively small in comparison to the top three which are Rabobank, ING and ABN AMRO. th
e
r n
o
Various legal and regulatory changes have had an impact on demand for insurance products in the Dutch market. This is especially  n
-
f
true in the life insurance market, where the tax deductibility of certain products has been reduced, leading to a shift to bank-saving  in
a
n
products. Moreover, volatility in economic and financial markets has meant that customers are more reluctant to commit themselves  c
ia
to long-term contracts. These changes have resulted in more competition, greater focus on competitive prices, improved customer  l in
f
service and retention, and product innovation. o
rm
a
t
In the pensions market the defined contribution (PPI) segment is set to grow further due to the fundamental changes of the Dutch  ion
pension system as of 2026 and the demand for transparent and cost-effective pension products. Significant growth of scale

c Regulation and supervision  c
e e
General 
Regulation of the financial sector in the Netherlands is included in the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht or Wft). 
The Wft embeds the cross-sectorial functional approach within the Dutch supervisory system. The supervision of financial institutions 
pursuant to the Wft rests with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). 
The DNB is responsible for prudential supervision, while the AFM supervises the conduct of business of financial institutions, and 
the conduct of business on financial markets. The aim of the DNB's prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial 
institutions and contribute to the stability of the financial sector. Regarding banks, the DNB undertakes its supervisory role, in particular 
V with respect to prudential supervision, together with the European Central Bank (ECB). V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re The AFM's conduct of business supervision focuses on ensuring orderly and transparent financial market processes, integrity  re
a a
tio in relations between market parties, and due care in the provision of services to customers.  tio
n n
The Dutch supervisory authorities have several formal tools to exercise their supervisory tasks. These tools include the authority 
to request information, if this is necessary for the purpose of prudential supervision, and the power to issue formal instructions 
to financial institutions, to impose fines, or to publish sanctions. The DNB, as prudential supervisory authority, can, under certain 
circumstances, require a recovery plan, a short-term financing plan, appoint a trustee, draw up a transfer plan or (ultimately) withdraw 
the license of a financial institution.
C C
rea The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Dutch DPA) supervises processing of personal data in order to ensure compliance with laws  rea
t t
in that regulate such use. The tasks and powers of the Dutch DPA are described in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),  in
g g
 su supplemented by the Dutch Implementation Act of the GDPR.  su

ab Financial supervision of insurance companies  ab

a a
lu lu
e e
The following insurance entities of Aegon the Netherlands are subject to prudential supervision of the DNB:
	Aegon Levensverzekering;
	Aegon Schadeverzekering;
	Aegon Spaarkas.
F An insurance company is neither permitted to conduct both life insurance and non-life insurance business within a single legal  F
in in
an entity (except for reinsurance), nor to carry out both insurance and banking activities within the same legal entity. Within Aegon  an
c c
ia the Netherlands, Aegon Levensverzekering, and Aegon Spaarkas conduct life insurance activities. Aegon Schadeverzekering conducts  ia
l inf non-life insurance activities. Prudential supervision is exercised by the home state supervisory authority (DNB in the Netherlands).  l inf
o o
rm rm
a a
tio Solvency II  tio
n n
The Solvency II framework is described in more detail in the section ‘Regulation and supervision’ of Aegon’s Integrated Annual 
Report 2020.
Aegon the Netherlands uses a partial internal model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position of its life insurance activities under 
Solvency II. The calculation includes the use of the volatility adjustment (VA), but does not include the use of any transitional measures. 
O O
th The initial internal model of Aegon the Netherlands was approved on November 26, 2015, by the supervisor, the DNB, as part  th
e e
r n of the Internal Model Application Process. Following the Internal Model Application Process, Aegon the Netherlands made several  r n
o o
n major changes to its PIM, the latest in 2020, all of which have been approved by the DNB. In 2020 Aegon the Netherlands included  n
- -
f f
in the Deterministic Adjustment (DA) in the PIM. The DA is a mechanism that corrects for the well-documented mismatches that exists  in
a a
n n
c between the EIOPA VA and the actual assets that Aegon the Netherlands invests in. These mismatches create non-economic volatility  c
ia ia
l in in the Solvency II position of Aegon the Netherlands which is a strategic risk for Aegon and ultimately the policyholders. The goal  l in
f f
o of the DA therefore is, to reduce the Solvency II ratio volatility due to basis risk between the EIOPA VA reference portfolio and Aegon  o
rm rm
a the Netherlands’s own assets. Basis risk arises due to the absence of mortgages in the EIOPA reference portfolio and the relatively high  a
t t
ion allocation to peripheral sovereigns and corporates compared to the portfolio of Aegon the Netherlands.  ion

Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers
A
The Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers (R&R Act) is the applicable intervention regime for insurance and reinsurance  t a
 g
companies in the Netherlands faced with financial difficulties. la
n
c
e
The R&R Act has introduced a revised regulatory framework for recovery and resolution of Dutch insurance and reinsurance companies 
and provides for a range of measures to be taken by these companies and the DNB ex ante, in order for these insurance and reinsurance 
companies to be prepared for recovery in circumstances where it no longer meets the required solvency requirements and for orderly 
resolution, in circumstances where it is failing or is likely to fail.
Financial supervision of credit institutions
Aegon Bank is subject to indirect supervision by the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), one of the elements 
of the Banking Union. The ECB may give instructions to the DNB in respect of Aegon Bank or even assume direct supervision over 
the prudential aspects of Aegon Bank's business. Pursuant to the banking supervision by the DNB, Aegon Bank is (among others)  V
a
required to file monthly, quarterly, and yearly regulatory reports as well as audited Financial Statements. Aegon Bank is subject  lue
 c
to Basel requirements in the Capital Requirements Regulation (‘CRR’) and the Capital Requirement Directive (‘CRD’), as implemented  re
a
in the Netherlands in the Wft. The CRD and CRR include requirements with respect to the quality and quantity of capital, as well as a  tio
n
liquidity framework. According to the EU Banking Reforms, competent authorities remain responsible for monitoring leverage policies 
and processes of individual institutions and may impose additional measures to address risk of excessive leverage, if warranted.
Based on the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (‘SREP’), the DNB sets Aegon Bank’s minimal capital and liquidity 
requirements.
The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (‘BRRD’), as implemented in the Netherlands in the Wft, and the Single Resolution  C
Mechanism Regulation (‘SRM Regulation’) form the European framework for recovery and resolution for (among others) ailing banks,  rea
t
certain investment firms and their holding companies. The BRRD provides for early intervention measures that may be imposed  in
g
by the DNB in respect of Aegon Bank in the event that its financial condition is deteriorating. It also allows the DNB under certain   su
s
circumstances to write down or convert relevant capital instruments in a specific order. Were Aegon Bank to fail or be likely to fail and  ta
in
the other resolution conditions were also met, the DNB would be able to place Aegon Bank under resolution. As part of the resolution  ab
le
scheme that could be adopted by the DNB, it may decide to apply certain resolution tools and exercise its powers pursuant   v
a
to the implemented BRRD in order to give effect to such resolution tools.  lu
e
Pursuant to the SRM Regulation and the BRRD, Aegon Bank is at all times required to meet a minimum amount of own funds and 
eligible liabilities (‘MREL’), expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds. The DNB will set a level of minimum MREL 
on a bank-by-bank basis based on assessment criteria due to be set out in technical regulatory standards.
In 2019, a comprehensive package of banking reforms to increase the resilience of EU institutions known as the 'EU Banking Reforms'  F
in

 su Overview of business Lines   su
s s
ta Aegon UK has successfully transformed from a traditional ‘insurer,’ competing with the likes of Prudential and Royal London to a  ta
in in
ab modern fee-based investment management platform competing with businesses such as Transact and Willis Towers Watson.  ab
le le
 v  v
a a
lu Over the last five years the UK business has focused on transforming and scaling its platform business. Aegon UK has done so through  lu
e e
organic growth and the acquisition of Cofunds retail savings platform, and BlackRock’s large employer Workplace pension business, 
and by disposing of non-core business lines, such as the disposal in 2017 of the Annuity portfolio, whilst progressing the outsourcing 
of service and administration for its traditional insurance company products. On October 9, 2020 Aegon announced an agreement 
to sell Stonebridge International Insurance Limited (SIIL). The cash proceeds amounted to GBP 6.9 million, with the potential for 
a further GBP 7 million in deferred consideration, depending on EEA policy transfers. The transaction agreements were signed 
F on October 8, 2020 and the divestment and legal completion was completed on February 28, 2021. F
in in
a a
n n
c c
ia The platform business is responsible for propositions sold through the Financial Adviser and Workplace channels, together with  ia
l inf protection products and an institutional trading platform business. The Financial Adviser and Workplace channels are supported  l inf
o o
rm by an investment solutions capability which allows customers to invest in Aegon UK funds. This capability is well established within  rm
a a
tio the Workplace channel with plans to significantly grow within the Financial Adviser channel. tio
n n
It is positioned for growth, given the participation in the Workplace pensions and Financial Advisor markets, which are forecast to grow 
at 9.4% and 12% over the next 5 years respectively.  
The traditional insurance company products are managed for value and are older products that are no longer actively marketed to new 
O O
th customers. However, new assets are accumulated as customers pay into existing policies, or as new employees join older Workplace  th
e e
r n schemes. In July 2019, Aegon UK completed the outsourcing of service and operations tasks to Atos with a 15-year contract to service  r n
o o
n and administer its traditional insurance company products, thereby improving the profitability of this business line. This builds  n

Overview of sales and distribution
A
Aegon UK has two principle distribution channels: Financial Advisers and Workplace, supported by a modern technology platform which  t a
 g
provides services both to the adviser/employer and their underlying customers. la
n
c
e
Aegon UK works with those advisers and employers to deliver an online experience for customers. The platform is designed to work 
for customers throughout their life as needs evolve by providing a comprehensive range of products and funds, moving with them each 
time they change employers and allow them to link in with different advisers. 
This gives Aegon UK the ability to support customers throughout their life journey unlike the majority of its competitors.
In addition, Aegon UK also participates in the protection and institutional trading platform markets.
Financial Adviser channel V
a
The Financial Adviser channel provides financial advisers and other institutions access to long-term savings and retirement products,  lue
 c
through an open architecture investment platform. It aims to capitalize on the strong demand for advice, especially within the growing  re
a
affluent population nearing and in retirement. tio
n
Aegon UK offers a comprehensive proposition allowing advisers to manage their client’s long-term investment through a wide range 
of tax wrappers (Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP), Individual Savings Account (ISA), General Investment Account (GIA)) investing 
in a choice of over 4,500 funds and equity trading. Aegon UK also offers its own investment solutions to advisers.
Aegon UK provides a technology platform that supports advisers and their customers in managing their finances and integrates into 
the back office of the adviser. The aim is to create a primary platform relationship, which positions Aegon UK to receive the majority  C
of new business flows from the adviser partner. An example being the partnership agreed with leading wealth/Workplace advisory firm  rea
t
LEBC in 2019 that has delivered significant additional flows in 2020. in
g
 s
u
s
Aegon UK partners with, around 4,500 advisers across a wide range of business models. These range from the world’s largest building  ta
in
society, Nationwide, to leading wealth management firms such as Chase De Vere, financial services networks such as Quilter and  ab
le
execution-only brokers.  v
a
lu
e
An important dimension of the Nationwide partnership is the inclusion of Aegon Investment Limited funds. This model was successfully 
extended in 2020 with the launch of an equivalent range of funds for Financial Advisers as Aegon UK builds out its investment 
solutions capability.
Workplace channel
The Workplace channel provides UK-based employers with Workplace pensions and savings schemes. It allows Aegon UK to participate  F
in
in the strong growing auto-enrolment market, cost effectively acquiring individual customer relationships. an
c
ia
Aegon UK now has a market-leading position covering all major Workplace savings products and participates in both the small and  l inf
o
medium-sized (SME) and large employer segments. A key driver of growth is in the Mastertrust product, the fastest growing sector  rm
a
of the UK DC market, where Aegon UK has an established and market leading offering. tio
n
Aegon UK works with leading employee benefits consultants and corporate advisers to provide a Workplace savings platform 
to employers such as WH Smith, EasyJet and Skanska. This combines its core pension capabilities with ISA and GIA, allowing employees 
to maximize their savings whilst employed and then take the product with them when they leave or if they should choose to take 
regulated advice in the future.
O
t
h
e
At the heart of this is Aegon UK’s employee digital portal, which provides tools to enable employees to make better informed decisions.  r n
o
It also links into the wider engagement activities such as seminars in the workplace, and online innovations such as the launch  n
-
f
of digital personalized summaries and an app that seeks to encourage customers to consolidate monies held elsewhere and increase  in
a
n
their savings. c
ia
l in
f
Aegon UK’s proposition extends to include a range of tools to assist employers with their governance responsibilities: auto enrolment  o
rm
functionality and member insights tool to enable them to effectively manage their pension schemes. a

Individual customer channel
A A
t a Aegon UK has a large and growing individual customer base, which is not attached to an adviser or employer. This base is over 1 million  t a
 g  g
la individuals and is forecast to continue to grow. These individuals are provided with tools that enable them to manage their finances and  la
n n
c with customer service support to help with guidance and referrals available to Aegon UK’s in-house Financial Adviser business, Origen,  c
e e
where appropriate.
Protection channel
Aegon UK offers a range of products for individual customers, including life cover, critical illness and income protection available 
through financial advisers. The target market is wealthier customers over the age of 40, where Aegon UK's underwriting expertise helps 
it to provide a customer-centric proposition.
This also provides a strong overlap with the target customers for Aegon UK’s Financial Adviser and workplace platform and the advisers 
V who help them, giving the opportunity to leverage opportunities to cross-sell. V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re In addition, Aegon UK offers a range of protection products for small to medium-sized companies that wish to insure key personnel,  re
a a
tio complementing the core Workplace channel. tio
n n
Institutional channel
Aegon UK also participates in the institutional market in two distinct areas where capability is provided to other parties who provide 
policy administration to the end-client:
	An institutional trading platform which powers 27 of the UK’s leading platforms, wealth management firms and investment houses 
(e.g. Brooks MacDonald, Charles Stanley) and administers a total of GBP 58 billion assets; and
C 	An investment-only proposition for Workplace pension schemes, which provides access to insured funds for approximately  C
rea 155 clients who represent GBP 7 billion assets under administration. rea

a a
lu Aegon UK encounters different competition in each of its core markets but is unique in the way it supports intermediaries wishing  lu
e e
to operate across channels providing an end-to-end customer experience. 
In the Financial Adviser market, Aegon UK competes with the likes of Fidelity, Transact and Quilter with the objective being to become

Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Additional information Overview of United Kingdom 372
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK regulators reiterated to firms that their rules give the ability for firms to consider their 
A
arrangements and customers’ circumstances. Firms were encouraged to review their arrangements to address the evolving situation  t a
 g
while managing the risks to their employees, customers and the impact on the market. Aegon UK put in place measures to allow  la
n
a regular review of changes to aid customers, and their regulatory impacts and this continues into 2021.  c
e
Financial supervision of insurance companies 
Scottish Equitable plc is authorized by the PRA and is subject to prudential regulation by the PRA and conduct regulation by the FCA. 
Every life insurance company licensed by and/or falling under the supervision of the PRA must file audited regulatory reports on at 
least an annual basis. These reports, primarily designed to enable the PRA to monitor the solvency of the insurance company, include 
a (consolidated) balance sheet, a (consolidated) income statement, a breakdown of the Solvency Capital Requirements, extensive 
actuarial information, and detailed information regarding the investments of the insurance company. The PRA's regulatory reporting 
is based on a single entity focus, and is designed to highlight risk assessment and risk management.
V
a
Regulatory Solvency Requirements lu
e
 c
The European Union Insurance Directives referred to collectively as Solvency II were incorporated into UK law with effect from January  re
a
1, 2016. Under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018, following completion of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, the UK has  tio
n
adopted Solvency II regulations and Binding Technical Standards into UK law, with the power to amend these as appropriate for 
the UK legal environment. Temporary Transitional Powers are in place under which certain provisions of EU regulations will continue 
to apply until March 31, 2022. Consequently, at present the UK continues to adopt regulatory solvency requirements which are closely 
aligned to those under Solvency II. Life insurance companies are required to maintain Own Funds which are sufficient to withstand 
a 1-in-200 shock on a 1-year value at risk basis subject to certain absolute minimum requirements. 
Since the introduction of Solvency II on January 1, 2016, Scottish Equitable plc has been using a Partial Internal Model (PIM)  C
to calculate the solvency position. The internal model was approved in December 2015, by the College of Supervisors as part  rea
t
of the Internal Model Approval Process, with an additional Major Model Change approved in July 2017, which added Currency Risk and  in
g
Operational Risk into the Internal Model. Following the end of the Brexit transition period, the PRA has deemed the existing PIM to be   su
s
approved for the calculation of the solo regulatory solvency requirements of Scottish Equitable plc ta
in
a
b
le
In addition, Scottish Equitable plc uses the Matching Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for its annuities, and   v
a
uses the Volatility Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for the With-Profits business with investment guarantees.  lu
e
Following the sale of the majority of its annuity business in 2017, Scottish Equitable plc no longer uses the transitional measures 
on technical provisions.
CRD IV
The Capital Requirements (Country by Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 (‘CRD IV’) came into force on January 1, 2014. These 
require credit institutions and investment firms, as defined within the directive, which are regulated under CRD IV, to “disclose annually,  F
in
specifying by Member State and by third country in which it has an establishment, the following information on a consolidated basis  an
c
for the financial year: name(s), nature of activities and geographical location; turnover; number of employees on a full time equivalent  ia
basis; profit or loss before tax; tax on profit or loss; public subsidies received”. l inf
o
rm
a
Cofunds Ltd and Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd are regulated by the FCA and maintain a capital framework in line with CRD IV.  tio
n
The information required by the legislation is published on Aegon’s websites.
Aegon Investments Limited is a BIPRU firm, is regulated by the FCA and must maintain a capital framework in line with the FCA 
Handbook requirements. 
O
In conjunction with the FCA, the investment related companies within the Aegon UK group will in future be subject to consolidated  th
e
reporting under CRD IV. This applies the same principles and rules under CRD IV to the consolidated group of entities.  r n
o
n
-
f
The Investment Firm Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firm Directive (IFD) are replacing the CRR framework in the EU for investment  in
a
n
firms. The FCA will publish the UK equivalent version of these requirements, with a target implementation date of January 1, 2022.  c
ia
These requirements cover capital, liquidity, reporting and disclosure and remuneration and work is underway to prepare for this change. l in

As part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) of Cofunds, the FCA requested that the Aegon UK Group perform 
a CRD IV prudential sub-consolidation. This prudential consolidation group is created in line with the CRR. A holding company, Aegon 
UK Investment Holdings Limited, has been established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegon UK plc, and has become the direct parent 
of: two CRD IV institutions, Cofunds Limited and Aegon Investment Solutions Limited; one BIPRU firm, Aegon Investments Limited; and 
an unregulated holding company, Momentum Group Ltd, along with its, Exempt Capital Adequacy Directive firm focused on financial 
advice, Origen Financial Services Limited, and an unregulated services company, Origen Limited. Going forward, much of our regulatory 
reporting will be on a Prudential Consolidation Group basis.

Aegon International operates a diversified portfolio of both established and growing   g
la
n
protection and retirement businesses in Southern and Eastern Europe (SEE) as well as  ce
scaling ventures and a high-net-worth insurance business in Asia.
International’s markets in SEE today include Hungary, Spain and Portugal, Turkey, Poland, and Romania. The Asian business operates 
two joint ventures in India and China and several wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Transamerica Life (Bermuda) Ltd. (TLB), serving 
the affluent segment, and Aegon Insights1, independent direct marketing organization in Asia Pacific.
The history of the region dates to 1980, when Aegon first entered the Spanish insurance market. The activities in Spain (and eventually 
Portugal) have developed largely through distribution partnerships with major Spanish banks, Banco Santander S.A. and Liberbank  V
a
S.A. Spain and Portugal are now one of the core growth markets of Aegon Group. In 1992, Aegon purchased the majority stake  lue
 c
in Hungary’s former state-owned insurance company, Állami Biztosító. It expanded in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) in the 2000s.  re
a
The operations in Asia were established in 2003, starting with a JV in China. Transamerica Life (Bermuda) Ltd. (TLB) was established  tio
n
in 2005 and its full-service branches opened in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2006. In 2008, the joint venture in India was formed. 
In November 2020, Aegon announced an agreement to sell its Central and Eastern European operations (Poland, Romania, Turkey, and 
Hungary) to Vienna Insurance Group, as part of its strategy to focus on key markets, simplify the footprint, and strengthen the balance 
sheet. The closing of the deal is expected in the course of 2021.

 g  g
la brokers, (tied) agents, and other digital/ e-commerce partners.  la
n n
c c
e e
The sales and distribution channel mix varies per country, reflecting the differences in the local insurance markets. The strategy is to 
invest in digital distribution platforms, particularly in Asia, to build distribution capabilities for the future.
Spain and Portugal
On December 19, 2012, Aegon España and Banco Santander S.A., the largest financial institution in Spain, signed a partnership 
agreement (joint venture) to distribute certain types of insurance products through Banco Santander’s network of branches. This 
joint venture was effectively created and the transaction closed on June 4, 2013. On December 31, 2014, Aegon España entered 
into a similar partnership in Portugal with Banco Santander and Santander Totta Seguros S.A., a Portuguese insurance company, part 
V of the Santander International group.  V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re In Spain and Portugal, the life insurance (mainly pure risk) and health products are sold by Santander Life Insurance and Reinsurance,  re
a a
tio whereas the non-life insurance (mainly accident, home, unemployment, disability, critical illness and funeral) products are sold  tio
n n
by Santander General Insurance and Reinsurance Company. Both entities in Spain and Portugal are joint venture entities where 
Aegon owns 51%.
Another of Aegon’s bancassurance partners in Spain, Liberbank, S.A., has a nationwide presence with a special focus on retail markets 
in several regions (Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla La Mancha and Extremadura). Liberbank distributes life insurance products through 
local branches. The distribution agreement is a joint venture between the Life and Pensions, Insurance and Reinsurance company 
C of Liberbank, S.A. and Aegon España, both parties holding equal ownership stakes. C
re re
a a
t t
in On July 10, 2020, Aegon and Banco Santander completed the acquisition of the in force term life policies previously sold through Banco  in
g g
 su Popular branches, following Banco Santander’s acquisition of Banco Popular. The joint venture also acquired the right to write new term   su
s s
ta life and selected lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander. ta

b b
le le
 v Aegon España’s own distribution channel offers life, health insurance and pension products. It is comprised of a network of brokers and   v
a a
lu agents, accounting for approximately 80% of the total sales of the fully owned subsidiary, while the remaining 20% of the total sales  lu
e e
is generated by the direct channel. 
Central & Eastern Europe
Distribution channels in Central & Eastern Europe are dominated by historically strong tied and external agency or brokers. The tied 
network is particularly strong in Hungary, Turkey, and Poland. In Hungary, there were approximately 1.700 tied agents by end 
F of 2020. Turkey’s tied network was comprised of over 660 agents, while Poland maintained a network of over 200 closely affiliated  F
in in
an agents. Turkey, Hungary1 and Poland generate more than 50% of their sales from these networks. an
c c
ia ia
l inf Other distribution channels include bank partners (in Romania and Turkey) and the direct online channel (gaining traction in Turkey).  l inf
o o
rm In July 2020, Romania’s distribution partnership with Banca Transilvania (BT) has been renewed for another five years, ensuring access  rm
a a
tio to one of the largest bank distribution channels in the country. tio
n n
As COVID-19 took its toll on sales, agent support schemes were rapidly designed and launched to protect the income and loyalty 
of the productive agents, such as income guarantee schemes or commission loans.
TLB and Aegon Insights
O O
th TLB distributes its products to high-net-worth customers through targeted distribution relationships with selected local and  th
e e
r n international brokers, as well as through bancassurance channels. From its strong market position in the Universal Life insurance space  r n

s
life, health, accident, and disability covers, distributed through the JVs and Aegon España’s own channels. These products can typically  ta

There were 24 licensed life insurers in India at the end of September 2020. While the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India 
continues to maintain a dominant share of new business premiums (both individual and group), private sector companies have 
grown only modestly to obtain more than 61% of the individual recurring new business premiums written (April 2020 to September 
2020). Insurance Companies in India experienced muted sales since March 2020 because of the nationwide lockdown enforced due 
to COVID-19 pandemic. Aegon Life India ranked 23rd among private life insurers according to individual recurring premiums (April 2020

market segment.
Regulation and supervision
SEE
In the European Union, a single insurance company may only be licensed for and conduct either a life insurance business or a non-
life insurance business, not both. In Hungary, however, insurance companies established before 1995 are exempt from this rule. This  C
exemption therefore applies to Aegon Hungary, which is a composite insurance company. rea

Aegon faces numerous risks, some of which may arise from internal factors, such as inadequate compliance systems and operational  la
n
change management. Others may arise from external factors, such as developments in financial markets, the business and/or political  c
e
environment, economic trends, politics and regulations. Any of the risks described below, whether internal or external, may materially 
and adversely affect the Company's operations, its earnings, the value of its investments, the sale of certain products and services or its 
ability to fulfil its obligations in respect of securities issued or guaranteed by it. The market price of Aegon securities could decline 
due to any of the risks described in this section and investors could lose some or all of the value of their investments. Additional risks 
of which Aegon is not presently aware could also materially and adversely affect its operations and share price. The business of an 
international financial services group such as Aegon is inherently exposed to risks that may only become apparent with the benefit 
of hindsight. 
The next section groups the risk factors into different categories based on the origin of the risk, while recognizing that the identified  V
a
risk factor can have broader consequences, including developments in financial markets (included under financial risks) can impact  lue
 c
policyholder behavior (included under underwriting risk). The categories used are: 1) financial risks, 2) underwriting risks, 3) operational  re
a
risks, 4) political, regulatory and supervisory risks, and 5) legal and compliance risks. Within each category the most material risk  tio
n
factors have been presented first. 
The described risk factors are those relating to Aegon’s businesses, and to Aegon's securities, including its common shares, of which 
Aegon is aware and which it considers material. Furthermore, described risk factors may affect Aegon’s businesses and operations 
in normal market circumstances, as well as in periods of significant economic uncertainty, when those risks may be more acute.
Summary
C
In summary, the risk factors cover the following topics in the designated category; rea
t
in
g
1. Financial risks  su
s
	Interest rate volatility, and sustained low or negative interest rate levels may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and  ta
in
shareholders’ equity. ab

	Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions may affect, and could have materially adverse effects  alu
e
on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
	Illiquidity of certain investment assets may prevent Aegon from selling investments at fair prices in a timely manner.
	Declines in value and defaults in Aegon’s debt securities, private placements and mortgage loan portfolios held in Aegon’s general 
and separate accounts, or the failure of certain counterparties, may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and shareholders’ equity.
	A decline in equity markets may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and shareholders’ equity, sales of savings and investment 
products, and the amount of assets under management. F
in
	A downturn in the real estate market may adversely impact valuations and cash flows. an
	The default of a major market participant may disrupt the markets and may affect Aegon’s business, financial condition, liquidity,  cia
operations and prospects. l inf
o
	Reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk may fail to meet their obligations. rm
	A downgrade in Aegon’s ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect relationships with distributors, and  atio
n
negatively affect Aegon’s results.
	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Aegon’s financial condition and reported results of operations.

2. Underwriting risks r n
	Underwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon insurance entities and includes policyholder behavior (such as lapses  on
-
f
or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses. The underwriting process requires, among  in
a
n
others, the setting of assumptions. Aegon’s reported results of operations and financial condition may be affected by differences  c
ia
between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserve assumptions both due to incurred gains/losses and from potential  l in
f
changes in best estimate assumptions that are used to value insurance liabilities. o
	Changes in assumptions, estimations, judgments are subjective, and discrepant valuations of DPAC and value of business acquired  rma
t
may adversely affect Aegon’s results of operations and financial condition. ion
	Certain of Aegon’s products have guarantees that may adversely affect its results, financial condition or liquidity.

Financial risks V
a
Interest rate volatility and sustained low or negative interest rate levels may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and  lue
 c
shareholders’ equity. re
a
t
io
n
Aegon is exposed to interest rate risk as both its assets and liabilities are sensitive to movements in long- and short-term interest rates 
as well as to changes in the volatility of interest rates.
During periods of decreasing interest rates, sustained low or even negative interest rates, as experienced in recent years, Aegon may 
not be able to preserve margins due to the existence of minimum interest rate guarantees and minimum guaranteed crediting rates 
provided in policies. Also, investment earnings may be lower because the interest earnings on new fixed-income investments are 
likely to have declined with the market interest rates. A prolonged low or even negative interest rate environment may also result  C
in a lengthening of maturities of the policyholder liabilities from initial estimates, due to lower policy lapses and longer duration  rea
t
of annuities. In this context, negative interest rates have comparable but larger impacts than low but positive rates. in
g
 s
u
s
In-force life insurance and annuity policies may be relatively more attractive to consumers due to built-in minimum interest rate  ta
in
guarantees, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features and a higher percentage of insurance  ab
le
policies remaining in force year-to-year. The majority of assets backing the insurance liabilities are invested in fixed-income securities.  v
a
lu
e
Aegon manages its investments and derivative portfolio, considering a variety of factors, including the relationship between 
the expected duration of its assets and liabilities. However, if interest rates remain low or even negative, the yield earned upon 
reinvesting interest payments from current investments, or from their sale or maturity, may decline. Reinvestment at lower yields may 
reduce the spread between interest earned on investments and interest credited to some of Aegon’s products and accordingly net 
income may decline. In addition, borrowers may prepay or redeem fixed maturity investments or mortgage loans in Aegon’s investment 
portfolio in order to borrow at lower rates. Aegon can lower crediting rates on certain products to offset the decrease in spread.  F
in
However, its ability to lower these rates may be limited by contractually guaranteed minimum rates or competition. an
c
ia
Depending on economic developments, interest rates for securities with shorter maturities may remain at low or even negative  l inf
o
levels for a prolonged period. In such an environment, an anchored expectation of low inflation or deflation could further push down  rm
a
the longer end of the interest rate curve which could have significant implications for Aegon’s operations and financial results. tio
n
The profitability of Aegon’s spread-based businesses depends, among other things, upon the ability to manage interest rate risk. Aegon 
may not be able to successfully manage interest rate risk or the potential negative impact of this risk.
Rapidly rising interest rates may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and available liquidity.
O
t
h
e
In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may and usually do increase. Premiums  r n
o
in flexible premium policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This activity may result  n
-
f
in cash payments by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are affected adversely  in
a
n
by the increase in market interest rates. This may result in realized investment losses. c
ia
l in
f
These cash payments to policyholders also result in a decrease in total invested assets and net income. Early withdrawals may also  o
rm
require accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC), which in turn reduces net income.  a

n n

e e
in the shorter term. Over time, the short-term reduction in shareholders' equity and income due to rising interest rates would be offset 
in later years, all else being equal.
Increased withdrawals and the need to post margin in relation to interest rate swaps if rates rise rapidly would put a strain 
on Aegon’s available liquidity.
Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions may affect, and could have materially adverse 
effects on, Aegon’s businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Any disruptions or downturns in the global financial markets or general economic conditions may result in reduced demand for 
Aegon’s products as well as impairments and reductions in the value of the assets in Aegon’s general account, separate account, and

behavior such as unfavorable changes in lapse rates. Aegon’s policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums,

e e
Illiquidity of certain investment assets may prevent Aegon from selling investments at fair prices in a timely manner. 
Aegon must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term cash demand under normal circumstances, as well as in crisis situations. 
Liquidity risk is inherent in many of Aegon’s businesses. Each asset purchased and liability (e.g., insurance product) sold has unique 
liquidity characteristics. Some liabilities can be surrendered, while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, 
F real estate and limited partnership interests, are to some degree illiquid. In depressed markets, Aegon may be unable to sell or buy  F
in in
an significant volumes of assets at quoted prices. an
c c
ia ia
l inf Any security Aegon issues in significant volume may be issued at higher financing costs if funding conditions are impaired.  l inf
o o
rm The necessity to issue securities can be driven by a variety of factors; for instance, Aegon may need liquidity for operating expenses,  rm
a a
tio debt servicing and the maintenance of capital levels of insurance subsidiaries. Although Aegon manages its liquidity position for  tio
n n
extreme events, including greatly reduced liquidity in capital markets, if these conditions were to persist for an extended period of time, 
Aegon may need to sell assets substantially below the prices at which they are currently recorded to meet its insurance obligations.
Aegon makes use of bilateral and syndicated credit facilities to support repayment of amounts outstanding under Aegon’s commercial 
paper programs and to serve as additional sources of liquidity. An inability to access these credit facilities, for example due to non-
O O

Declines in value and defaults in Aegon’s debt securities, private placements, mortgage loan portfolios and other instruments 
A
held in Aegon’s general and separate accounts, or the failure of certain counterparties, may adversely affect Aegon’s  t a
 g
profitability and shareholders’ equity. la
n
c
e
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the default by, or failure to meet contractual obligations of, issuers and counterparties. 
Aegon also considers credit risk to include spread risk, that is, the value of a bond declines due to a general widening of credit spreads. 
For general account products, Aegon typically bears the risk for investment performance equaling the return of principal and interest 
on fixed income instruments. Aegon is exposed to credit risk on its general account fixed-income portfolio (debt securities, mortgages, 
small and medium sized entities (SME) & consumer loans and private placements), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and reinsurance 
contracts. In addition, financial institutions acting as a counterparty on derivatives may not fulfill their obligations. Default by issuers 
and counterparties on their financial obligations may be due to, among other things, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, market downturns 
or operational failures, and the collateral or security they provide may prove inadequate to cover their obligations at the time 
of the default. Losses in excess of predicted losses due to any such default or series of defaults by issuers or counterparties may have  V
a
a material adverse effect on Aegon’s results of operations and financial position. lue
 c
re
a
Additionally, Aegon is indirectly exposed to credit risk on the investment portfolios underlying separate account liabilities. Changes  tio
n
to credit risk can result in separate account losses, which increase the probability of future loss events. In the United States and 
the Netherlands for instance, separate account products can include guarantees which protect policyholders against some or all 
of the downside risks in their separate account portfolio. Reduced separate account values also decrease fee income and may 
accelerate deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) amortization. Reconsideration of assumptions might also affect the DPAC 
amortization schedule. These factors may have a material adverse effect on Aegon’s results of operations and financial position.
Aegon’s investment portfolio includes Dutch government bonds, US Treasury, agency and state bonds, other government-issued  C
securities and corporate bonds. Especially in a weak economic environment Aegon may incur significant investment impairments due  rea
t
to defaults and overall declines in the capital markets. Defaults or other reductions in the value of these securities and loans may have  in
g
a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  su
s
t
a
in
A decline in equity markets may adversely affect Aegon’s profitability and shareholders' equity, sales of savings and  ab
le
investment products, and the amount of assets under management.  v
a
lu
e
Aegon and its customers run the risk that the market value of its equity investments declines. Exposure to equity markets exists 
in both assets and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility 
in returns and investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in policyholders’ accounts for insurance and 
investment contracts (such as variable annuities, unit-linked products, and mutual funds) where funds are invested in equities. 
Although most of the risk remains with the policyholder, guarantees within certain products may transfer some or all of this risk 
to Aegon. Lower investment returns also reduce the asset management fee that Aegon earns on the asset balance in these products,  F
in
and prolonged investment under-performance may cause existing customers to withdraw funds and potential customers not to grant  an
c
investment mandates. ia
l in
f
o
Some of Aegon’s insurance and investment contract businesses have minimum return or accumulation guarantees, which require Aegon  rm
a
to establish reserves to fund these future guaranteed benefits when equity market returns do not meet or exceed these guarantee  tio
n
levels. Aegon’s reported results under IFRS-EU, are also at risk if returns are not sufficient to allow amortization of DPAC, which 
may impact the reported net income as well as shareholders’ equity. Volatile or poor market conditions may also significantly reduce 
the demand for some of Aegon’s savings and investment products, which may lead to lower sales and net income.
A downturn in the real estate market may adversely impact valuations and cash flows.
O
t
h
e
Aegon’s investment portfolio has a large exposure to the residential real estate market in the Netherlands through the residential  r n
o
mortgages sourced by Aegon and the AMVEST funds. As an indication, at year-end 2020 Aegon’s general account investments  n

affect Aegon and Aegon’s contract counterparties. In addition, such a failure may impact future product sales as a potential result 
of reduced confidence in the insurance industry. The default of one or more large international financial institutions, which may 
result in disruption or termination of their cash, custodial and/or administrative services, may also have a material adverse impact 
on Aegon’s ability to run effective treasury and asset management operations.
Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a government or financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead 
to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults. This risk is sometimes referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect 
financial intermediaries, such as clearing members or futures commissions merchants, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and

Reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk may fail to meet their obligations.
Aegon’s insurance subsidiaries cede premiums to other insurers under various agreements that cover individual risks, group risks 
or defined blocks of business, on a co-insurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. The purpose of these 
reinsurance agreements is to spread the risk and minimize the effect of losses. The amount of each risk retained depends on an 
evaluation of the specific risk, which is subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the characteristics of coverage. 
C Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse for the ceded amount in the event a covered claim  C
rea is paid. However, Aegon’s insurance subsidiaries remain liable to their policyholders for ceded insurance if any reinsurer fails to meet  rea
t t
in the obligations assumed by it. A bankruptcy or insolvency or inability of any of Aegon’s reinsurance counterparties to satisfy its  in

Claims-paying ability and financial strength ratings are factors in establishing the competitive position of insurers. A rating downgrade 
(or a change in outlook indicating the potential for such a downgrade) of Aegon or any of its rated insurance subsidiaries may, among 
other things, materially increase the number of policy surrenders and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies. 
Aegon cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions Aegon may take in response to the actions of rating 
agencies. As with other companies in the financial services industry, Aegon’s ratings may be downgraded at any time and without notice

c As an international group, Aegon is subject to foreign currency translation risk. Foreign currency exposure also exists when policies  c
ia ia
l in are denominated in currencies other than Aegon’s functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance  l in
f f
o and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local currencies  o
rm rm
a to the extent shareholders’ equity is required to satisfy regulatory and Aegon’s self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, currency  a

subordinated and senior debt) in various currencies in amounts that are targeted to correspond to the book value of Aegon’s business 
A
units. This balancing is intended to mitigate currency translation impacts on equity and leverage ratios. Aegon may also hedge  t a
 g
the foreign exchange component of expected dividends from its principal business units that maintain their equity in currencies other  la
n
than the euro. c
e
To the extent the foreign exchange component of expected dividends is not hedged, or actual dividends vary from expected, 
Aegon’s net income and shareholders’ equity may fluctuate. As Aegon has significant business segments in the Americas and 
in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences between the US dollar 
and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro. Aegon may experience significant changes in net income and shareholders’ 
equity because of these fluctuations.
Aegon may be unable to manage risks successfully through derivatives.
V
a
Aegon is exposed to changes in the fair value of its investments, the impact of interest rate, equity markets and credit spread changes,  lue
 c
currency fluctuations and changes in mortality and longevity. Aegon uses common financial derivative instruments, such as swaps,  re
a
options, futures, and forward contracts, to hedge some of the exposures related to both investments backing insurance products  tio
n
and Company borrowings. Aegon may not be able to manage the risks associated with these activities successfully through the use 
of derivatives. In addition, a counterparty may fail to honor the terms of its derivatives contracts with Aegon. Clearing members 
and clearing houses may terminate their derivatives contracts with Aegon. Aegon’s inability to manage risks successfully through 
derivatives, a counterparty’s failure to honor Aegon’s obligations or the systemic risk that failure is transmitted from counterparty 
to counterparty may each have a material adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
Valuation of Aegon’s investments, allowances and impairments is subjective, and discrepant valuations may adversely affect  C
Aegon’s results of operations and financial condition. rea
t
in

The valuation of many of Aegon’s financial instruments is based on methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject   su
s
to different interpretations. Changes to investment valuations may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s results of operations  ta
in
and financial condition. In addition, the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments and  ab

other assets is subjective and based on assumptions, estimations and judgments that may not reflect or correspond to Aegon’s actual   v

e
Underwriting risks
Underwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon insurance entities and incudes policyholder behavior (such as lapses 
or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses. The underwriting process requires, 
among other things, the setting of assumptions. Aegon’s reported results of operations and financial condition may be 
affected by differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserve assumptions both due to incurred  F
in
gains/losses and from potential changes in best estimate assumptions that are used to value insurance liabilities. an
c
ia
There is a risk that the pricing of Aegon’s products turns out to be inadequate if the assumptions used for pricing do not materialize.  l inf
o
Aegon’s earnings depend significantly on the extent to which actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used  rm
a
in setting the prices for Aegon’s products and the extent to which the established technical provisions for insurance liabilities,  tio
n
both under IFRS and Solvency II reporting, prove to be sufficient. If actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying 
assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, Aegon’s income would be reduced. Furthermore, if less favorable claims experience 
became sustained, Aegon may be required to change its best estimate assumptions with respect to future experience, potentially 
increasing the technical provisions for insurance liabilities, which may reduce Aegon’s income and solvency ratio. In addition, certain 
acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets 
O
on the balance sheet and are being amortized into income over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these  th
e
policies (such as future claims, investment income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs may be accelerated  r n
o
and may require write-offs should there be an expectation that the costs are not fully recoverable. This may have a materially adverse  n

effect on Aegon’s results of operations and financial condition. in

c
ia
Sources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality  l in

rm
recover up-front sales expenses despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender charges and fees. In addition, some  a
t
policies have embedded options which at times are more valuable to the client if they stay (lower lapses) or leave (higher lapses), which  ion
may result in losses to Aegon’s businesses. Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality or morbidity increases, such

n n
c Aegon’s annuity products may continue to experience adverse effects due to longer expected benefit payment periods. Aegon is also  c
e e
at risk if expenses are higher than assumed.
Changes in assumptions, estimations, judgments are subjective, and discrepant valuations of DPAC and value of business 
acquired may adversely affect Aegon’s results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in assumptions, estimations, judgments or actual experience may require Aegon to accelerate the amortization of DPAC 
and value of business acquired, establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, or recognize impairment of other 
assets, any of which may materially adversely affect Aegon’s results and financial condition.

markets and interest rates. As a result, a drop in the value of underlying assets or more volatile markets could result in an increase 
in the valuation of Aegon’s liabilities associated with these products. An increase in these liabilities may decrease its net income. Aegon

Reinsurance may not be available, affordable, or adequate to protect Aegon against losses.
As part of Aegon’s overall risk and capital management strategy, Aegon purchases reinsurance for certain risks underwritten

exposed to the risk of a pandemic (such as Asian Flu, SARs or COVID-19) occurring in one or more of the countries in which Aegon 
A
operates or globally. Aegon can be impacted through for instance higher mortality rates in the countries in which it operates and  t a
 g
through lower sales and higher lapses on its products due to limitations on customer interactions, pressure on customer income and  la
n
increased uncertainty. Such events may lead to considerable financial losses to Aegon’s businesses. These catastrophic events may  c
e
also lead to adverse market movements which increase the adverse impacts to Aegon’s financial position. For instance, prices and 
credit quality of investments can be impacted. In addition, monetary policy measures from central banks can result in lower interest 
rates. Furthermore, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, civil unrest, military actions, and fires may disrupt Aegon’s operations 
and result in significant loss of property, key personnel, and information about Aegon and its clients. If its business continuity plans 
have not included effective and sufficient contingencies for such events, Aegon may also experience business disruption and damage 
to corporate reputation and financial condition for a substantial period of time.
Operational risks
Competitive factors may adversely affect Aegon’s market share. V
a
lu
e
 c
Competition in Aegon’s business segments is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims  re
a
paying ability, ratings, and name recognition. Aegon faces intense competition from a large number of other insurers, as well as non- tio
n
insurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual customers, employers, other 
group customers, agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Consolidation in the global financial services 
industry can enhance the competitive position of some of Aegon’s competitors by broadening the range of their products and services 
and increasing their distribution channels and their access to capital. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels 
for certain types of insurance and securities products, including use of digital technologies and platforms, may result in increasing 
competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Traditional distribution channels are also challenged 
by the ban on sales-based commissions in some countries. These competitive pressures may result in increased pricing pressures  C
on a number of Aegon's products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share. This may harm Aegon’s ability  rea
t
to maintain or increase profitability. in
g
 s
u
s
Adverse market and economic conditions can be expected to result in changes to the competitive landscape. Financial distress  ta
in
experienced by financial services industry participants as a result of weak economic conditions and newly imposed regulations may  ab
le
lead to acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the competitive landscape in which Aegon operates may be affected by government-  v
a
sponsored programs or actions taken in response to, for instance, dislocations in financial markets. Aegon’s ability or that  lu
e
of Aegon’s competitors to pursue such opportunities may be limited due to lower earnings, reserve increases, capital requirements 
or a lack of access to debt capital markets and other sources of financing. Such conditions may also lead to changes by Aegon 
or Aegon’s competitors in product offerings and product pricing that may affect Aegon and Aegon’s relative sales volumes, market 
shares and profitability. 
Aegon may have difficulty managing its expanding operations, and Aegon may not be successful in acquiring new businesses  F
in
or divesting existing operations. an
c
ia
Over time, Aegon has made a number of acquisitions and divestments around the world and it is possible that Aegon may make further  l inf
o
acquisitions and divestments in the future. Acquisitions and divestments involve risks that may adversely affect Aegon’s operating  rm
a
results and financial condition. These include: the potential diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;  tio
n
difficulties in assimilating or disentangling operations, technologies, products and personnel; significant delays in completing 
the integration of disentangling operations; the potential loss of key employees or customers; and potential losses from unanticipated 
litigation and tax and accounting issues. In addition, expansion into new and emerging markets may involve heightened political, legal 
and regulatory risks, such as discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls.
O
Aegon’s acquisitions may result in additional indebtedness, costs, contingent liabilities, and impairment expenses related to goodwill  th
e
and other intangible assets. Acquisitions may also have a dilutive effect on the ownership and voting percentages of existing  r n
o
shareholders. Divestments of existing operations may result in Aegon assuming or retaining certain contingent liabilities. Aegon may  n
-
f
not be able to divest assets within the time or at the price planned. All of these factors may adversely affect Aegon’s businesses,  in
a
n
results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that Aegon will successfully identify suitable acquisition  c
ia
candidates or buyers for operations to be divested or that Aegon will properly value acquisitions or divestments. Aegon is unable  l in
f
to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate or buyer for operations to be divested will become available,  o
rm
or the likelihood that any transaction will be completed once negotiations have commenced. a

Aegon may experience difficulties in distributing and marketing products through its current and future distribution channels.
A A
t t
 a  a
 g  g
la Although Aegon distributes its products through a wide variety of distribution channels, Aegon’s ability to market its products could  la
n n
c be affected if key relationships are interrupted. Distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationship with  c
e e
Aegon due to adverse developments in its (or their) business. Further, key distribution partners may also merge or change their 
business models in ways that affect how Aegon’s products are sold, or new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact 
the effectiveness of its current distribution efforts.
When Aegon’s products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, Aegon may not always be able to monitor or control the manner 
of their distribution despite its significant training and compliance programs. If Aegon’s products are distributed by such firms in an 
inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, Aegon may suffer reputational and other harm to its business.
V Aegon may be unable to adapt to and apply new technologies. V
a a
lu lu
e e
 c  c
re New technologies are transforming the insurance industry. New technologies include but are not limited to communication channels,  re
a a
tio automation, artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain. These technologies are changing the way insurance is distributed  tio
n n
and sold. They are also changing the way insurers manage their businesses and the skills they need in their workforces. Furthermore, 
the new technologies are influencing customer and consumer demands. Technology makes it easier to move into new markets. This 
increases competition, not just among peers, but also from new competitors and disruptors. An inability to adapt quickly enough to and 
apply these new technologies may impact Aegon’s competitive position, and its ability to maintain profitability, and may adversely 
affect Aegon’s future financial condition and results of operations.
C Failure of data management and governance can result in regulatory and reputational risk as well as missed business opportunities. C
re re
a a
t t
in Data is essential for Aegon’s operational performance. However, much of the data held by Aegon is subject to various legal, regulatory  in
g g
 su and contractual restrictions. To be able to benefit from the data Aegon holds, areas like data management and governance are of key   su
s s
ta importance. Most internal processes and customer interactions are dependent on accessible, reliable, and compliant data practices and  ta
in in
ab operations. If Aegon fails to adequately execute on these obligations, there are potential legal, regulatory, contractual and reputational  ab
le le
 v risks. Aegon also must endeavor to obtain adequate data rights to be able to execute on its business strategy. Failure to do so will   v
a a
lu expose it to additional legal risks, including litigation risks.  lu
e e
Aegon may be impacted by epidemics or pandemics.
Aegon is exposed to the risk of an epidemic or a pandemic – such as Asian Flu, SARs or COVID-19 – occurring in one or more 
of the countries in which it operates or globally. As with other catastrophic events, Aegon can be impacted through, for instance, 
F higher mortality rates in the countries in which it operates and through lower sales, higher lapses on products or arrears on contractual  F
in in
an payments by customers with respect to policies and mortgage loans. Such impacts can be due to, for instance, limitations on customer  an
c c
ia interactions, economic hardship, pressure on customer income, increased loans or withdrawals and increased uncertainty. The impacts  ia
l inf can be larger where the epidemic or pandemic leads to adverse market movements – prices and credit quality of investments and  l inf
o o
rm defaults on investments – and monetary policy measures resulting in lower interest rates. If the health of a significant number  rm
a a
tio of employees or key functions is compromised or internal controls need to be executed in an atypical way, these could have an impact  tio
n n
on core business processes, service levels to customers, and the effectiveness of the control environment. In addition, Aegon faces 
additional operational risks related to prolonged and expanded working from home/remote working by Aegon's workforce, such 
as additional remote access to company information which could increase information security risk. Also, Aegon can be impacted 
via its relationships with third parties. These third parties can also be impacted by an epidemic or pandemic with knock-on impacts 
on Aegon. The described risks may directly or indirectly impact Aegon’s financial health and its ability to generate capital in the medium

 g
la
n
Transition risks are those arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy. These risks are a function of policy and regulatory  c
e
uncertainty, including political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Transition risks can affect the value 
of assets and investment portfolios. Furthermore, Aegon may be unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. Linked 
to both the physical and the transition risks, there could also be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering 
or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate 
both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.
Given the significant uncertainties related to climate change impacts and its long-term nature, it cannot be ruled out that climate 
change may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 
V
a
Aegon’s risk management policies and processes may leave the Company exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk events,  lue
 c
adversely affecting its businesses, results, and financial condition. re
a
t
io
n
Aegon has devoted significant resources to the implementation and maintenance of a comprehensive enterprise risk management 
framework in all aspects of the business. Nevertheless, it is possible that risks present in its business strategies and initiatives are not 
fully identified, monitored, and managed or that risks are not properly measured. Risk measurements make use of historic and public 
data that may be inaccurate or may not predict future exposures. 
Failure of Aegon’s information technology or communications systems may result in a material adverse effect on Aegon’s 
results of operations and corporate reputation. C
re
a
t
Any failure of or gap in the systems and processes necessary to support complex transactions and avoid and/or detect systems failure,  in
g
fraud, information security failures, processing errors, cyber intrusion, loss of data and breaches of regulation may lead to a materially   su
s
adverse effect on Aegon’s results of operations and corporate reputation. In addition, Aegon must commit significant resources  ta
in
to maintain and enhance its existing systems in order to keep pace with applicable regulatory requirements, industry standards and  ab
le
customer preferences. If Aegon fails to maintain secure and well-functioning information systems, Aegon may not be able to rely   v
a
on data for product pricing, compliance obligations, risk management and underwriting decisions. In addition, Aegon cannot assure  lu
e
investors or consumers that interruptions, failures or breaches in security of these processes and systems will not occur, or that if they 
do occur, that they can be timely detected and remediated. The occurrence of any of these events may have a materially adverse effect 
on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
A computer system failure or security breach may disrupt Aegon’s business, damage Aegon’s reputation and adversely affect 
Aegon’s operational results, financial condition, and cash flows. F
in
a
n
c
Aegon relies heavily on computer and information systems and internet and network connectivity to conduct a large portion of its  ia
business operations. This includes the need to securely store, process, transmit and dispose of confidential information, including  l inf
o
personal information, through a number of complex systems. In many cases this also includes transmission and processing to or  rm
a
through commercial customers, business partners, (semi-) governmental agencies and third-party service providers. The introduction  tio
n
of new technologies, computer system failures, cyber-crime attacks or security or data privacy breaches may materially disrupt 
Aegon’s business operations, damage Aegon’s reputation, result in regulatory and litigation exposure, investigation and remediation 
costs, and materially and adversely affect Aegon’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The information security risk that Aegon faces includes the risk of malicious outside forces using public networks and other methods, 
O
including social engineering and the exploitation of targeted offline processes, to attack Aegon’s systems and information. It also  th
e
includes inside threats, both malicious and accidental. For example, human error, unauthorized user activity and lack of sufficiently  r n
o
automated processing can result in improper information exposure or use. Aegon also faces risk in this area due to its reliance in many  n
-
f
cases on third-party systems, all of which may face cyber and information security risks of their own. Third-party administrators  in
a
n
or distribution partners used by Aegon or its subsidiaries may not adequately secure their own information systems and networks  c
ia
or may not adequately keep pace with the dynamic changes in this area. Potential bad actors that target Aegon and its applicable third  l in
f
parties may include, but are not limited to, criminal organizations, foreign government bodies, political factions, and others. o

In recent years information security risk has increased sharply due to a number of developments in how information systems are used  ion
by companies such as Aegon, but also by society in general. Threats have increased as criminals and other bad actors become more

e e
Large, global financial institutions such as Aegon have been, and will continue to be, subject to information security attacks for 
the foreseeable future. The nature of these attacks will also continue to be unpredictable, and in many cases may arise from 
circumstances that are beyond Aegon’s control. Especially if and to the extent Aegon fails to adequately invest in defensive 
infrastructure, timely response capabilities, technology, and processes or to effectively execute against its information security 
strategy, it may suffer material adverse consequences.
To date the highest impact information security incidents that Aegon has experienced are believed to have been the result of e-mail 
phishing attacks targeted at Aegon’s business partners and commercial customers. This in turn led to unauthorized use of valid Aegon 
V website credentials to engage in fraudulent transactions and improper data exfiltration. Additionally, Aegon has also faced other  V
a a
lue types of attacks, including but not limited to other types of phishing attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as well  lue
 c  c
re as certain limited cases of unauthorized internal user activity, including activity between different Aegon country units. Although  re
a a
tio to Aegon’s knowledge these events have thus far not been material in nature, Aegon management recognizes the need to establish and  tio
n n
maintain adequate information security systems that are capable of addressing the possibility of these types of attacks, as well as for 
the possibility of more significant and sophisticated information security attacks, in the future. There is no guarantee that the measures 
that Aegon takes will be sufficient to stop all types of attacks or mitigate all types of information security or data privacy risks.
Aegon maintains cyber liability insurance to help decrease the financial impact of cyber-attacks and information security events, 
subject to the terms and conditions of the policy; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all applicable losses that

In addition, Aegon analyzes personal information and customer data to better manage its business, subject to applicable laws 
and regulations and other restrictions. It is possible that additional regulatory or other restrictions regarding the use of such 
techniques may be imposed. Additional privacy and information security obligations have been imposed by various governments with 
jurisdiction over Aegon or its subsidiaries in recent years, and more such obligations are likely to be imposed in the near future across 
Aegon’s operations. Such restrictions and obligations could have material impacts on Aegon’s business, financial conditions and/
or results of operations.

io
n
Aegon uses econometric, financial, and actuarial models to measure and manage multiple types of risk, to price products and 
to establish and assess key valuations and report financial results. All these functions are critical to Aegon’s operations. Aegon 
has a model risk management framework in place to manage modelling risk. If, despite this framework, models, their underlying 
methodologies, assumptions and estimates, or their implementation and monitoring prove to be inaccurate, this could have an adverse 
effect on Aegon’s business, financial condition, and results.
Many of Aegon’s business units offer investment products that utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations that  C
could experience errors or prove to be incorrect, incomplete or unsuccessful, resulting in losses for clients who have invested  rea
t
in such products and possible regulatory actions and/or litigation against Aegon and/or its affiliates. in

Aegon’s business units may utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations (whether proprietary or supplied by third parties)  ta
in
(Models) or information, or data supplied by third parties (Data) for the management of, or to assist in the management of, investment  ab
le
products offered to clients. Examples of such investment products include volatility controlled funds, mutual funds, separately   v
a
managed accounts, and other types of advisory accounts. Models and Data are used to construct sets of transactions and investments,  lu
e
to provide risk management insights, and may be used to assist in hedging investments. If Models and Data prove to be incorrect 
or incomplete, any decisions made, in whole or part, in reliance thereon expose the investment product to additional risks. For example, 
by utilizing Models or Data, certain investments may be bought at prices that are too high, certain other investments may be sold 
at prices that are too low, or favorable opportunities may be missed altogether. Similarly, any hedging based on faulty Models and Data 
may prove to be unsuccessful. The applicable investment product bears the risk that Models or Data used will not be successful and 
the product may not achieve its investment objective. F
in
a
n
c
Models can be predictive in nature. The use of predictive Models has inherent risks. For example, such Models may incorrectly forecast  ia
future behavior, leading to potential losses on a cash flow and/or a mark-to-market basis. In addition, in unforeseen or certain  l inf
o
low-probability scenarios (often involving a market disruption of some kind), such Models may produce unexpected results, which  rm
a
can result in losses for an investment product. Furthermore, the success of relying on or otherwise using Models depends on a  tio
n
number of factors, including the validity, accuracy and completeness of the Model’s development, implementation and maintenance, 
the Model’s assumptions, factors, algorithms and methodologies, and the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical 
or other Data.
Models rely on, among other things, correct and complete Data inputs. If incorrect Data is entered into even a well-founded Model, 
O
the resulting information will be incorrect. However, even if Data is input correctly, Model prices may differ substantially from market  th
e
prices, especially for securities with complex characteristics. Investments selected with the use of Models may perform differently than  r n
o
expected as a result of the design of the Model, inputs into the Model or other factors. Additionally, if investment products offered  n

e e
As Aegon continues to focus on reducing expenses necessary to support its business, a key part of its operating strategy has been 
to outsource certain services that are important to its business. Aegon outsources certain information technology, finance and 
actuarial services, investment management services and policy administration operations to third party providers and may do so 
increasingly in the future. If Aegon fails to maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not provide 
the core administrative, operational, financial, and actuarial services Aegon requires and anticipates, or perform as contracted, 
such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffer an information security or data privacy breach, Aegon may not 
realize the productivity improvements or cost efficiencies or customers might experience lower service levels. In addition, Aegon 
may not be able to find an adequate alternative provider, and instead experience financial loss, reputational harm, operational 
V difficulties, increased costs, a loss of business and other negative consequences, all of which could have a material adverse effect  V
a a
lue on Aegon’s results. In addition, Aegon’s reliance on third party providers does not relieve Aegon of its responsibilities and requirements.  lue
 c  c
re Any failure or negligence by such third-party providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in Aegon being subjected  re
a a
tio to liability and litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly and time-consuming, and the outcome would  tio
n n
be uncertain. Moreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely 
affect Aegon’s reputation and distribution of its products. Finally, Aegon’s ability to receive services from third party providers based 
in different countries might be impacted by political instability, cultural differences, regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside 
of the countries within which Aegon has operations. As a result, Aegon’s ability to conduct its business might be adversely affected
Aegon may be unable to attract and retain personnel who are key to the business.
C C
rea As a global financial services enterprise, Aegon relies, to a considerable extent, on the quality of local management and  rea
t t
in personnel in the various countries in which Aegon operates. The success of Aegon’s operations is dependent, among other things,  in
g g
 su on Aegon’s ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel. Competition for key personnel in most countries   su
s s
ta in which Aegon operates is intense. Aegon’s ability to attract and retain key personnel is very much dependent on the competitiveness  ta

a a
lu As a part of the governmental response in Europe and, to a certain extent, the United States to the financial crisis in 2008, there  lu
e e
have been various legislative initiatives that have sought to give guidance or regulate the structure of remuneration for personnel, 
in particular senior management, with a focus on performance-related remuneration and limiting severance payments. With differences 
in interpretation of these regulations by local regulators on how the guidelines need to be applied, as well as the question of whether 
they apply to insurance industries at all, these restrictions create an uncertain playing field and may adversely affect Aegon’s ability 
to compete for qualified employees, as well as Aegon’s ability to transfer employees between regions.

o Prudential regulatory requirements may not only apply to the individual entities in the Aegon Group but may additionally apply  o

t t

The way such requirements are applied to groups like Aegon has an impact on the Group’s capital position, as well as on the availability  c
e
of capital at a Group level. Changes to prudential regulatory requirements may have an impact on Aegon’s competitive position 
versus companies that are not subject to these or similar requirements at Group level. As an example, as part of the Solvency 
II group calculation, Aegon applies a specific methodology for its US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries at Group level, in addition 
to the requirements to which these subsidiaries are subject under their local prudential regime. This methodology is approved 
by Aegon’s group supervisor, De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. (DNB), but remains subject to periodic review. Changes to this methodology 
might have an impact on Aegon’s capital position, as calculated under Solvency II group requirements and/or the manner in which 
DNB otherwise exercises group supervision on Aegon, for example through more stringent requirements with respect to intra-group 
transactions, risk concentrations and reporting.
V
a
There are several important regulatory standards with respect to capital adequacy that apply to Aegon and are subject to change,  lue
 c
which changes could impact Aegon’s financial position and results:  re
	A further review of the Solvency II framework, referred to as the Solvency II 2020 review. EIOPA has recently published an extensive  atio
n
technical advice to the European Commission in the form of an opinion on a broad range of topics within the Solvency II framework. 
This opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II forms important input for the European Commission in the preparation of its formal 
proposal for amendments to the Solvency II Directive and Solvency II Delegated Regulation, that is expected to be published in the 
second half of 2021. The impact on Aegon’s financial position and results depends on the extent to which the EIOPA advice will 
be embraced by the European Commission and the European co-legislators;
	The NAIC’s requirements with respect to risk-based capital. The NAIC continues to review the risk-based capital (RBC) charges for 
invested assets. Additionally, the NAIC has an ongoing project to review longevity risk. These initiatives or other regulatory changes  C
to capital factors may lead to higher risk-based capital requirements. In addition, the NAIC formed the Group Capital Calculation (E)  rea
t
Working Group charged with constructing a US group capital calculation (GCC) using an RBC aggregation approach that would  in
g
be used by regulators as a monitoring tool. The results of the GCC could impact the translation of RBC in the Group capital ratio for   su
s
the United States; and ta
in
	US state insurance regulators’ perspectives on the use and value of captive insurance companies. Aegon utilizes affiliated captive  ab
le
insurance companies to manage risks of various insurance policies issued before the adoption of principle-based reserves, including   v
a
universal life with secondary guarantees and level term life insurance. These structures have been utilized to finance regulatory  lu
e
reserves. To the extent that state insurance regulations restrict or require insurers to restate the valuation of the assets used 
to finance these structures, this could increase costs or reduce available capital.
In addition to requirements imposed by regulatory and/or supervisory authorities, rating agencies may incorporate higher capital 
thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital for Aegon’s regulated subsidiaries for Aegon Group and/
or its regulated subsidiaries to maintain their desired credit ratings. F
in
a
n
c
The application of these capital standards and changes thereto could adversely affect Aegon’s ability to compete with other insurers  ia
that are not subject to those capital requirements. These requirements may also lead Aegon to engage in transactions that affect  l inf
o
capital and constrain Aegon’s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its own shares. Furthermore, such requirements may constrain  rm
a
Aegon’s ability to provide guarantees and may increase the cost to Aegon of offering certain products, resulting in price increases,  tio
n
discontinuance of offering of certain products or reducing the amount of risk Aegon takes on. Aegon may consider structural and other 
business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which the impact 
on shareholders cannot be predicted. For further detail on developments in these areas, we refer to the section ‘’Regulation and 
supervision’’ of Aegon’s Integrated Annual Report 2020.
O
Changes in accounting standards may affect Aegon’s reported results, shareholders’ equity and dividend. th
e
r n
o
Aegon’s financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS-EU. Any future changes in these accounting  n
-
f
standards may have a significant impact on Aegon’s reported results, financial condition, shareholders’ equity and dividend. This  in
a
n
includes the level and volatility of reported results and shareholders’ equity. New accounting standards that are likely to have  c
ia
a significant impact on Aegon’s reported results, financial condition and shareholders’ equity include, but are not limited to, IFRS 9 –  l in
f
Financial Instruments and IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts.  o
rm
a
t
The IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, which was endorsed by the European Union  ion
in November 2016. The IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4, which was intended as an

interim solution and allowed insurers to continue to use accounting principles that they had applied prior to the initial adoption 
A A
t a of IFRS. In June 2020, the IASB decided, application subject to EU endorsement process, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to  t a
 g  g
la annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023 (and also extend the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from  la
n n
c applying IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023). c
e e
An implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new Standard. It is expected that the impact of the initial 
application on Aegon’s financial statements will be significant.
Local statutes, regulators, and decisions of supervisory and other authorities may limit the ability of Aegon’s subsidiaries to 
pay dividends to Aegon N.V., thereby limiting Aegon’s ability to make payments on debt obligations.
Aegon’s ability to make payments on debt obligations and pay operating expenses is dependent upon the receipt of dividends 
V from subsidiaries, in particular, but not limited to, the operating companies in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK. Most of these  V
a a
lue subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that can limit the payment of dividends. In addition, local regulators in the countries  lue
 c  c
re where Aegon operates, supervisory and other authorities (such as EIOPA or the European Systemic Risk Board) may decide to impose  re
a a
tio or advise on further restrictions to dividend payments, or discourage such payments, specifically in exceptional and unpredictable  tio
n n
economic circumstances. This may affect Aegon’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations or pay its operating expenses. 
Risks of application of intervention measures may adversely affect Aegon’s business, results of operations and financial 
position.
The Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers (‘R&R Act’) allows DNB to intervene in situations where a Dutch insurer 
C or reinsurer is faced with financial difficulties. The powers under the R&R Act may also extend to the level of the Group and to entities,  C
rea other than insurance or reinsurance entities in the Netherlands, which are part of the Group, such as Aegon N.V. rea
t t
in in
g g
 su In addition, the R&R Act allows DNB to require a Dutch insurance or reinsurance company or a group to remove, ex ante, material   su
s s
ta impediments to effective resolution of a Dutch insurance or reinsurance undertaking (such as the revision of financing arrangements,  ta
in in
ab the reduction of exposures, the transfer of assets, the termination or limitation of business activities, or the prohibition on starting  ab
le le
 v certain business activities, changing the legal or operational structure of the Group, or securing certain critical business lines). The use   v
a a
lu of this tool may adversely affect Aegon’s business, results of operations and financial position. lu
e e
The EIOPA opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II, referred to above, includes advice to the European Commission to include 
provisions, relating to minimum harmonization of recovery and resolution regime within the European Union, in the formal proposal 
for amendments to the Solvency II framework, expected to be published in the 2nd half of 2021. This might lead to the introduction 
of intervention tools, similar to those included in the R&R Act, in other EU member states in which Aegon’s subsidiaries are active.
F F
in in
an Furthermore, to parts of the Aegon Group, in particular Aegon Bank N.V., the framework of the EU Directive on the recovery and  an
c c
ia resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the ‘Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive’) is applicable. The Bank Recovery  ia
l inf and Resolution Directive contains provisions that where both Aegon Bank N.V. and Aegon N.V. fail or are likely to fail, could be applied  l inf
o o
rm to mixed financial holding companies such as Aegon N.V., including the right of bail-in of creditors. rm
a a
t t
io io
n n
Lastly, when the stability of the financial system is threatened by the condition of a financial institution the Dutch Minister of Finance 
may intervene immediately, in which case legal or statutory provisions, applicable to the financial institution, might be superseded. 
The intervention measures available to the Minister of Finance include, in particular, the right to expropriate assets of the financial 
institution, as well as securities and/or other financial instruments issued by or with the cooperation of the financial institution. 
The exercise of this power may significantly impact the rights of the owners or holders of these assets, securities and/or financial 
O O
th instruments. th
e e
r n r n
o o
n There is a risk that the possible exercise of powers, or any perceived exercise of powers, by DNB or the Ministry of Finance could have  n

Since January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the European Union. The post-Brexit relationship between 
A
the European Union and the United Kingdom is governed by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This Agreement does not  t a
 g
include material arrangements relating to financial services. The European Union and the United Kingdom intend to agree upon  la
n
a memorandum of understanding by March 2021 to establish the framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services, covering,  c
e
among other things, transparency and appropriate dialogue in the process of adoption, suspension and withdrawal of equivalence 
decisions in the area of financial services. As the Transition Period only ended recently and with a significant lack of clarity around 
the way in which the provision of financial services between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be regulated, Aegon 
could be adversely impacted by unexpected developments and market developments, any of which could reduce the value or results 
of Aegon’s operations, in particular Aegon’s operations in the United Kingdom. Aegon could also be adversely impacted should Brexit 
result in the United Kingdom moving away from European Union legislation such as, but not limited to, Solvency II regulations and 
financial services legislation.
V
Legal and Compliance alu
e
 c
re
a
The outcome of legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations and actions may adversely affect Aegon’s  tio
n
business, results of operations and financial position.
Aegon faces significant risks of litigation as well as regulatory investigations and actions relating to its and its subsidiaries’ businesses 
as well as Aegon’s compliance with regulations applicable to it as a corporate entity.
Insurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely the subject of litigation, investigation and regulatory activity 
by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants, and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions  C
in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These actions may involve issues  rea
t
including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes; investment  in
g
returns; sales practices; claims payments and practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial   su
s
costs, ongoing costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change  ta
in
related matters; competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; and intellectual property. ab
le
 v
a
Aegon entities are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including for example the US Bank Secrecy Act, the Dutch  lu
e
Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act (Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorisme), 
UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Act, European Anti-Money Laundering Directives, or other regulations 
and these require us to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report 
suspicious activity, and maintain certain records. Further, Aegon entities are required to follow certain economic and trade sanctions 
programs, including for example ones administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, HM Treasury or the Council of EU that 
prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected persons, governments, and in certain circumstances, countries. Changes in, or violations  F
in
of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions  an
c
or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, financial condition and result of operations. ia
l in
f
o
Aegon entities may be subject to anti-bribery legislation such as the Foreign Corruption and Practices Act in the US, the UK Bribery  rm
a
Act, Dutch anti-bribery provisions and other regulations. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws by Aegon, its employees,  tio
n
subsidiaries or local agents, could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and reputation and result in substantial financial 
penalties or other sanctions.
Government and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive, or other proceedings and/
or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary 
O
amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business  th
e
practices in response to inquiries. r n
o
n
-
f
Customers of certain of Aegon’s products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products which are affected  in
a
n
by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile, or change due  c
ia
to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon. l in
f

The existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining  a
t
the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon  ion
becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure as well may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated,

c In some jurisdictions, plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts under enhanced liability legal theories  c
e e
or claims of bad faith, which can result in tort, punitive and/or statutory damages. Damages alleged may not be quantifiable 
or supportable or may have no relationship to economic losses or final awards. As a result, Aegon cannot predict the effect of litigation, 
investigations or other actions on its business.
Separate from financial loss, litigation, regulatory action, legislative changes or changes in public opinion may require Aegon to change 
its business practices, which could have a material adverse impact on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations, cash flows and 
financial position. Disputes and investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements, 
including payments or changes to business practices, even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit.
V V
a a
lue Several US insurers, including Aegon subsidiaries, have been named in class actions, as well as individual litigation, relating to increases  lue
 c  c
re in monthly deduction rates (MDR) on universal life products. Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup past  re
a a
tio losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon’s subsidiary in the US has agreed to settle two  tio
n n
such class actions that had been venued in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first 
case, approved in January 2019, arose from increases implemented in 2015-2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated 
in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represent approximately 43% of the value 
of the settlement fund. The individual opt out cases and disputes are on-going. Resolution of this class action ended a number 
of other related cases, including other federal and state class actions. In the second case, Aegon’s subsidiary agreed to settle 
a class action lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement on 16 September 2020. 
C Opt-outs in this case represent less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. On 15 October 2020, two opt-out policyholders  C
rea whose objections to the settlement were overruled by the trial court filed an appeal. The appeal has delayed implementation  rea
t t
in of the settlement. The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs, although Aegon continues to hold a provision for  in
g g
 su these policyholders. In the only individual case against Aegon’s subsidiary to reach trial (in 2017), a jury found that a 2013 increase to a   su
s s
ta certain group of policies was improper. The jury verdict was affirmed on appeal, which ended the case. ta

 v In addition, insurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities may face lawsuits that threaten their business models.   v
a a
lu For example, several US-based Aegon subsidiaries are defendants in a class action alleging that the business model improperly  lu
e e
characterizes distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, this lawsuit, along with similar 
claims against other companies, as well as regulatory action, could necessitate a change in the business model and/or could result in a 
significant settlement or judgment.
In the Netherlands, unit linked products (beleggingsverzekeringen) have been controversial and the target of litigation since 2005. 
F Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups have  F
in in
an formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been  an
c c
ia involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product  ia
l inf lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce  l inf
o o
rm future policy costs for the large majority of its unit-linked portfolio. Some of the unit linked products are still involved in ongoing  rm
a a
tio litigation. In September 2014, consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a claim against Aegon in court. The claim  tio
n n
related to a range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation. 
In June 2017, the court issued a verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated according to the standards 
at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl were dismissed under 
this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a limited set of policies. The district 
court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation arrangements provide sufficient 
O O
th compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed the class action proceedings  th
e e
r n during the preliminary proceedings at the Supreme Court in another class action of Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl against another insurance  r n
o o
n company. Aegon expects the claims and litigation, whether collective or on an individual basis and in court or through alternative  n

in dispute resolution mechanisms, on unit linked products to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against  in
a a
n n

o Lawsuits have also been brought against providers of securities leasing products (aandelenlease producten). Although sales  o
rm rm
a of securities leasing products ended more than a decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced. In 2016, the Dutch  a
t t
ion Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a securities leasing product sold by one of Aegon’s competitors. It decided that the financial  ion
institution was liable if a broker (remisier) that advised on the sale of the institution’s products, was not properly licensed. It also 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
Additional information Risk factors Aegon N.V. 400
upheld the ruling of the Court of Appeals that a higher compensation might be payable in those circumstances, regardless 
A
of the financial position of the customer at the time of entering into the securities leasing contract. In July 2016, consumer interest  t a
 g
group Stichting Platform Aandelenlease filed a mass claim against Aegon Bank regarding securities leasing product Sprintplan.  la
n
In October 2017, the district court of The Hague ruled in favor of Aegon that the Sprintplan liability had been conclusively determined  c
e
in earlier proceedings and there were no grounds to hold further collective proceedings. The plaintiff appealed. In February 2020, 
the Court of Appeal rejected all claims filed by platform Aandelenlease against Aegon Bank. Platform Aandelenlease confirmed that 
it will not appeal the ruling of the Court of Appeal which makes the ruling of the Court of Appeal final. 
In the Netherlands Aegon is also involved in claims for compensation and the cancellation or nullification of contracts concerning 
the Vliegwiel product, a variation on securities leasing products Currently, proceedings are pending before the Dutch courts and 
the Financial Services Complaints Authority (‘Klachteninstituut Financiële Dienstverlening’), with numerous cases having been initiated 
by Leaseproces B.V. In December 2020 Aegon reached an agreement on a settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for those customers 
of Vliegwiel and Sprintplan products who are represented by Leaseproces B.V. The settlement is subject to conditions precedent and  V
a
further operational details have yet to be agreed. Execution of the settlement is expected in 2021. lue

There can be no assurances that these matters will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon’s business,  tio
n
results of operations, competitive position, reputation, and financial position. For additional information on proceedings in which 
Aegon is involved, refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 45 ‘Commitments and contingencies’ 
of Aegon’s Integrated Annual Report 2020.
Changes in government regulations in the jurisdictions in which Aegon operates may affect profitability and operating models.
Aegon’s regulated businesses, such as insurance, banking, and asset management, are subject to comprehensive regulation and  C
supervision. The primary purpose of such regulation is to protect clients of these operating companies (e.g. policyholders), rather  rea
t
than holders of Aegon shares, capital securities and debt instruments. Changes in existing laws and regulations may affect the way  in
g
in which Aegon conducts its businesses, including its relationship with distributors of its products and other third parties and   su
s
the structure of its relationship with employees. These changes may evolve over time and be open to interpretation through judicial and  ta
in
enforcement action. Such changes may also affect the profitability of its businesses and the products it offers. Additionally, the laws  ab
le
or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may impose greater restrictions on Aegon’s financial flexibility and operations   v
a
or may result in higher costs to operate than currently is the case, including but not limited to financial and accounting requirements;  lu
e
information security, data privacy, transfer, storage, and usage requirements; modeling and other actuarial requirements and standards; 
investments, reserves, and financial management.
Aegon may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable 
to its businesses and legal entities. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws and 
regulations may result in restrictions on Aegon’s ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which Aegon operates and  F
in
may result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, financial position or results  an
c
of operations. ia
l in
f
o
Certain key regulatory proposals that could materially impact Aegon’s financial condition and results of operations are described below. rm
a
t
io
n
Regulatory changes include preventive and corrective supervisory measures that aim to address macro-prudential concerns, referred 
to in the Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector, as adopted by the IAIS in November 2019. Aegon was 
designated a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII) by the FSB in 2015. The FSB, in consultation with the IAIS, has decided 
to suspend G-SII identification as from the beginning of 2020 and in November 2022 will, based on the initial years of implementation 
of the holistic framework, review the need either to discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of G-SIIs. 
O
t
h
e
In addition, the ComFrame, which was adopted in November 2019 by the IAIS, establishes minimum supervisory standards and  r n
o
guidance on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) and builds on the IAIS Insurance  n
-
f
Core Principles (a set of principles that is applicable to all insurers). Therefore, IAIGs may be subject to additional standards that other  in
a
n
insurers or other insurance groups are not subject to. c
ia
l in
f
On May 12, 2020, DNB announced, in line with expectations due to Aegon’s former designation as a G-SII, that it has identified Aegon  o
rm
as one of the two IAIGs in the Netherlands, based on the size and international activities of the Aegon group.  a

e e
and other business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which 
the impact on shareholders cannot be predicted.
As referred to above, the Solvency II 2020 review covers a broad range of topics of the Solvency II framework. Aegon’s insurance 
subsidiaries, as well as Aegon at Group level is subject to the Solvency II framework. If the technical advice, provided to the European 
Commission through the EIOPA Opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II is taken over by the European Commission and the European 
co-legislators to a significant extent and without material changes, the amendments to the Solvency II framework may have 
a significant impact on the activities, profitability and financial position of Aegon and Aegon’s subsidiaries in the European Union.

lue In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) adopted in 2010 has been challenged in whole  lue
 c  c
re or in part since its adoption. Changes to the PPACA and to other laws and regulations impacting the US health insurance industry  re
a a
tio could have a material adverse effect on Aegon’s financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position. The extent  tio
n n
to which employers or individuals may discontinue their purchase of supplemental health insurance products as a result of any such 
changes may significantly impact Aegon USA’s supplemental health insurance products business. The extent of any such changes 
or the corresponding impact on Aegon USA’s supplemental health insurance business cannot be determined at this time.
On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI), a new rule requiring broker-dealers and investment advisers 
to recommend only those financial products to their customers that are in their customers’ best interest, and to clearly identify 
C any potential conflicts of interest and financial incentives the broker-dealer may have in connection with the sale of such products.  C
rea In addition, since the Department of Labor (DOL) Fiduciary Rule was vacated in July 2018, several states have moved forward with  rea
t t
in developing their own similar rules and proposals, which in some instances substantially broaden the standard of care traditionally owed  in
g g

have a material impact on annuity sales and, as applicable, life insurance sales.
Changes in pension and employee benefit regulation, social security regulation, financial services regulation, taxation and the regulation 
of securities products and transactions may adversely affect Aegon’s ability to sell new policies or claims exposure on existing policies.

an private-market retirement plans. More than 30 US states have considered legislation that would establish state-run plans but fewer  an
c c

l inf questions as to whether such plans are pre-empted by ERISA. l inf

tio In general, changes in laws and regulations may materially increase Aegon’s direct and indirect compliance costs and other ongoing  tio
n n
business expenses and have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
Tax risks may adversely affect Aegon’s businesses and profitability.
Aegon is subject to the substance and interpretation of tax laws in all countries in which Aegon operates or invests. The majority 
O O
th of tax risks relate to both Aegon’s products and its businesses, that would materialize due to (i) changes in tax laws, (ii) changes  th
e e
r n in interpretation of tax laws, (iii) later jurisprudence or case law, or (iv) the introduction of new taxes or tax laws. These tax risks include  r n
o o
n for example the risk of changes in tax rates, changes in loss carry-over rules and changes in customer taxation rules. n
- -
f f
in in
a a
n n
c Tax risks also include the risk of consequences arising from failure to comply with procedures required by tax authorities. Failure  c
ia ia
l in to manage tax compliance risks could potentially leads to inaccurate, incomplete, or untimely tax returns. Materialization of those risks  l in
f f
o would lead to non-compliance, and potentially increased tax charges, penalties, and interest. Failure to manage reporting risks, may  o
rm rm
a lead to tax positions in financial reporting that do not represent a true and fair view. a

Most of Aegon’s insurance products enjoy certain policyholder tax advantages. This permits, for example, the build-up of earnings 
A
on gross premium amounts with deferred taxation, if any, when the accumulated earnings are actually paid to our customers.  t a
 g
Legislators have, from time to time, considered legislation that may make Aegon’s products less attractive to consumers, including  la
n
legislation that would reduce or eliminate this deferral of taxation. This may have an impact on insurance products and sales. c
e
Overall, tax risks may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, profits, capital, and financial condition.
Judgments of US courts may not be enforceable against Aegon in Dutch courts.
There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement 
of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Judgments of US courts, including those predicated 
on the civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws, may not be enforceable in Dutch courts. Therefore, Aegon’s investors 
that obtain a judgment against Aegon in the United States may not be able to require Aegon to pay the amount of the judgment unless  V
a
a competent court in the Netherlands gives binding effect to the judgment, or, if possible, the US investor has brought a successful  lue
 c
original action in a Dutch court. Therefore, investors are required to undertake more action in order to enforce a US court judgment  re
a
than in relation to any US counterparty. tio
n
Aegon may not manage risks associated with the reform and replacement of benchmark rates effectively.
Aegon recognizes that the reform of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates) and any transition to replacement rates entail risks for all our 
businesses across our assets and liabilities. These risks include, but are not limited to:
	Legal risks, as Aegon is required to make changes to documentation for new and existing transactions, such as funding instruments 
issued with an IBOR reference and derivatives held with an IBOR reference; C
	Financial risks, arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates, such as derivatives and  rea
t
floating rate notes, issued by, or invested in by Aegon; in
g
	Pricing risks, as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some funding instruments or investments;  su
s
	Operational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt informational technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and  ta
in
operational processes; and ab
	Conduct risks, relating to communication with potential impact on Aegon’s customers, and engagement during the transition period. le v
a
lu
e
Various supranational institutions, central banks, regulators, benchmark administrators and industry working groups play a role 
in the benchmark reform and the preparation for the replacement of IBORs. Although a lot of work has been done, there is still 
significant uncertainty around liquidity development, and the timetable and mechanisms for implementation, including application 
of spread adjustments to the alternative reference rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what 
extent, any such changes would affect Aegon. However, the implementation of alternative reference rates may have a material adverse 
effect on Aegon’s business, financial condition, customers, and operations. F
in
a
n
c
Aegon may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. ia
l in
f
o
Aegon relies on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws  rm
a
to establish and protect Aegon’s intellectual property. Third parties may infringe on or misappropriate Aegon’s intellectual property,  tio
n
and it is possible that third parties may claim that Aegon has infringed on or misappropriated their intellectual property rights. 
Any resulting proceedings in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property or defend itself against 
a claim of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property, may require significant effort and resources and may not prove 
successful. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property, Aegon may lose 
intellectual property protection, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations, financial 
O
condition and Aegon’s ability to compete and pursue future business opportunities. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon  th
e
would have to defend itself against a claim of infringement of a third-party’s intellectual property, Aegon may be required to pay  r n
o
damages and provide injunctive relief, which may have a materially adverse effect on Aegon’s businesses, results of operations and  n

n n
c c
e e
The price at which Aegon’s common shares trade is influenced by many factors, some of which are specific to Aegon and 
Aegon’s operations, and some of which are related to the insurance industry and equity markets in general. As a result of these factors, 
investors may not be able to resell their common shares at or above the price paid for them. In particular, the following factors, 
in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a material impact on the market price of Aegon’s common shares:
	Investor perception of Aegon as a company;
	Actual or anticipated fluctuations in Aegon’s revenues or operating results;
	Announcements of intended acquisitions, disposals or financings, or speculation about such acquisitions, disposals or financings;

option on common shares B, which Vereniging Aegon may exercise to keep or restore its total stake at 32.6%, irrespective 
of the circumstances which cause the total shareholding to be or become lower than 32.6%.
As a matter of Dutch corporate law, common shares and common shares B offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal 
values (EUR 0.12). The financial rights attached to a common share B are 1/40 of the financial rights attached to a common share. 
O O
th The Voting Rights Agreement between Aegon N.V. and Vereniging Aegon ensures that under normal circumstances, i.e. except  th
e e
r n in the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will no longer be able to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial  r n
o o

Currency fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of Aegon’s common shares and the value of any cash 
A
distributions made. t a
 g
la
n
Since Aegon’s common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam are quoted in euros and Aegon’s common shares listed on NYSE New York  c
e
are quoted in US dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and the US dollar may affect the value of Aegon’s common 
shares. In addition, Aegon declares cash dividends in euros, but pays cash dividends, if any, on Aegon’s New York registry Shares 
in US dollars based on an exchange rate set the business day following the shareholder meeting approving the dividend. As a result, 
fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the US dollar value of any cash dividends paid.
Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities (or other securities that permit or require Aegon to satisfy its obligations by 
issuing common shares) that Aegon may issue could influence the market price for Aegon’s common shares.
In April 2019, Aegon issued EUR 500 million Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities (“PCCS”). Upon the occurrence of a conversion  V
a
trigger event the PCCS will be converted into common shares of the Company at the prevailing conversion price. A conversion trigger  lue
 c
event, shall occur if at any time: (i) the amount of eligible own funds items eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement is equal  re
a
to or less than 75% of the Solvency Capital Requirement; (ii) the amount of own fund items eligible to cover the Minimum Capital  tio
n
Requirement is equal to or less than the Minimum Capital Requirement; (iii) in case the Minimum Capital Requirement is an event, such 
event occurs; or (iv) a breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement has occurred and such breach has not been remedied within a period 
of three months from the date on which the breach was first observed. The conversion price was set at EUR 2.994 per common share 
and will be adjusted upon occurrence of dilutive events like stock splits, extraordinary dividends or stock dividends, rights issues and 
others. A reduction of the conversion price will result in an increase in the number of common shares to be issued.
The PCCS and other convertible securities may influence the market for Aegon’s common shares. For example, the price  C
of Aegon’s common shares may become more volatile and may be depressed by the issue of common shares upon conversion  rea
t
of the PCCS and/or any convertible securities or by the acceleration by investors of any convertible securities (or other such securities)  in
g
that Aegon may have issued. Negative price developments may also result from hedging or arbitrage trading activity by holders of such   su
s
convertible securities that may develop involving such convertible securities (or other such securities) and Aegon’s common shares. Any  ta
in
such developments may negatively affect the value of Aegon’s common shares. ab

la Under Dutch law and Aegon’s articles of association, holders of Aegon’s common shares are entitled to dividends paid out of the profits  la
n n
c remaining, if any, after the creation of a reserve account. Aegon’s Executive Board may determine the dividend payment date and  c
e e
the dividend record date for the common shares, which may vary for the various kinds of registered shares. Aegon’s Executive Board, 
with the approval of Aegon’s Supervisory Board, may also determine the currency or currencies in which the dividends will be paid. 
Aegon may make one or more interim distributions to the holders of common shares.
Aegon aims to pay out a sustainable dividend to allow equity investors to share in Aegon’s performance, which can grow over time 
if Aegon’s performance so allows. Aegon’s plans for returning capital to shareholders are based on the actual and expected capital 
position of its operating units, the expected levels of capital generation and free cash flow and the expected allocation of capital 
to invest in Aegon’s strategy and in the quality of its balance sheet. After investment in new business to generate organic growth, 
V capital generation in Aegon’s operating subsidiaries is available for distribution to the holding company, while maintaining a capital and  V
a a
lue liquidity position in the operating subsidiaries in line with Aegon’s capital management and liquidity risk policies in addition to adhering  lue
 c  c
re to local regulatory and statutory requirements and restrictions.  re
a a
t t
io io
n n
Aegon uses cash flows from its operating subsidiaries to pay unallocated holding expenses, including funding costs. The remaining 
cash flow is available to execute Aegon’s strategy and to fund dividends on its shares, subject to maintaining the Holding’s capital 
and liquidity in line with its capital management and liquidity risk policies. Aegon’s Executive Board takes into account the actual 
and expected capital position of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding balances, leverage ratios and strategic considerations 
when declaring or proposing dividends on common shares. Depending on circumstances, future prospects and other considerations, 
Aegon’s Executive Board has discretion to deviate from the aforementioned capital and liquidity measures.
C C
rea Under normal circumstances, Aegon would expect to declare an interim dividend when announcing Aegon’s second quarter results  rea
t t
in and to propose a final dividend at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for approval. Dividends would normally be paid in cash  in
g g
 su or stock at the election of the shareholder. The relative value of cash and stock dividends may vary. Stock dividends paid may, subject   su
s s
ta to capital management and other considerations, be repurchased in order to limit dilution.  ta
in in
a a
b b
le le
 v When determining whether to declare or propose a dividend, Aegon’s Executive Board balances prudence versus offering an attractive   v
a a
lu return to shareholders. This is particularly important during adverse economic and/or financial market conditions. Furthermore,  lu
e e
Aegon’s operating subsidiaries are subject to local insurance regulations that could restrict dividends to be paid to the Company. There 
is no requirement or assurance that Aegon will declare and pay any dividends. 
Holders of common shares historically have been permitted to elect to receive dividends, if any, in cash or in common shares. For 
dividends, which holders may elect to receive in either cash or common shares, the value of the stock alternative may differ slightly 
F from the value of the cash option. Aegon pays cash dividends on shares of New York registry in US dollars through Citibank, N.A.,  F

n
For information with respect to provisions in the Articles of Association relating to members of the Supervisory Board and Executive 
Board, refer to the Governance section (see pages 48-52).
Description of Aegon’s capital stock
Aegon has two types of shares: common shares (par value EUR 0.12) and common shares B (par value EUR 0.12).
Common characteristics of the common shares and common shares B
C
	All shares are in registered form; rea
t
	All shares have dividend rights except for those shares (if any) held by Aegon as treasury stock. Dividends which have not been  in
g
claimed within five years lapse to Aegon;  su
s
	Each currently outstanding share is entitled to one vote except for shares held by Aegon as treasury stock. There are no upward  ta
in
restrictions; ab
	However, under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a Special Cause, based on the Voting Rights Agreement, Vereniging  le v
a
Aegon will not be able to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial rights represented by its shares. This means that  lu
e
in the absence of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 
40 common shares B it holds. As Special Cause qualifies the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon N.V., a tender offer for 
Aegon N.V. shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group of persons, whether individually or as a group, other

Actions necessary to change the rights of shareholders
A A
t a A change to the rights of shareholders would require an amendment to the Articles of Association. The General Meeting  t a
 g  g
la of Shareholders (Annual General Meeting or Extraordinary General Meeting) may only pass a resolution to amend the Articles  la
n n
c of Association pursuant to a proposal of the Executive Board with the approval of the Supervisory Board. The resolution requires  c
e e
a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in order to pass. The actual changes to the text of the Articles of Association will 
be executed by a civil law notary.
Furthermore, a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders to amend the Articles of Association which has the effect of reducing 
the rights attributable to holders of a specific class shall be subject to the approval of the meeting of holders of such class.
Conditions under which meetings are held
Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders shall be convened by public notice. Notice must be given 
V no later than 42 days prior to the date of the meeting. The notice must contain a summary agenda and indicate the place where  V
a a
lue the complete agenda together with the documents pertaining to the agenda may be obtained. The agenda is also sent to shareholders  lue
 c  c
re registered with the Company Register. New York Registry shareholders or their brokers receive a proxy solicitation notice. re
a a
t t
io io
n n
For admittance to and voting at the meeting, shareholders must produce evidence of their shareholding as of the record date. 
The Dutch law determines that the record date is 28 days prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders. Shareholders must notify 
Aegon of their intention to attend the meeting.
Limitation on the right to own securities

United States tax consequences to holders of shares
A A
t t
 a  a
 gla Introduction  gla
n n
c This section describes certain US Federal income tax consequences to beneficial holders of common shares that are held as capital  c
e e
assets, including certain Dutch withholding tax considerations. This section does not address all US Federal income tax matters that 
may be relevant to a particular holder. Each investor should consult their tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of an 
investment in the common shares. This section does not address tax considerations for holders of common shares subject to special tax 
rules including, without limitation, the following:
	Financial institutions;
	Insurance companies;
	Dealers or traders in securities or currencies;
	Tax-exempt entities;
V 	Regulated investment companies; V
a a
lue 	Persons that at any time hold the common shares as part of a 'hedging' or 'conversion' transaction or as a position in a 'straddle'  lue
 c  c
re or as part of a 'synthetic security' or other integrated transaction for US Federal income tax purposes; re
atio 	US expatriates and former citizens or former residents of the United States; atio
n 	Persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the stock being taken into  n
account in an applicable financial statement;
	Holders that own (or are deemed to own for US Federal income tax purposes) 10% or more of the voting shares of Aegon;
	Partnerships, or arrangements treated as partnerships for US tax purposes, or pass-through entities or persons who hold common 
shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities; and
	Holders that have a 'functional currency' other than the US dollar.
C C
rea Further, this section does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or the indirect effects on the holders of equity interests  rea
t t
in in a holder of common shares. This section also does not describe any tax consequences arising under the laws of any taxation  in
g g
 su jurisdiction other than the Federal income tax laws of the US Federal government.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, US Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative  ab
le le
 v interpretations, in each case as in effect and available on the date of this Annual Report. All of the foregoing is subject to change,   v
a a
lu which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. lu
e e
For the purposes of this section, a 'US holder' is a beneficial owner of common shares that is, for US Federal income tax purposes:
	A citizen or individual resident of the United States;
	A corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States (including the District 
of Columbia);
F 	An estate, the income of which is subject to US Federal income taxation regardless of its source; F
in in
an 	A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more US persons  an
c c
ia have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of such trust. ia
l in l in
f f
o o
rm A non-US holder is a beneficial owner of common shares that is neither a US holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for  rm
a a
tio US federal income tax purposes. tio
n n
If an entity treated as a partnership for US Federal income tax purposes holds common shares, the tax treatment of a partner 
in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made 
at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding common shares and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax 
advisors regarding the US Federal income tax consequences to them.

Dividend withholding tax in the Netherlands
A
Withholding requirement t a
 g
Aegon is required to withhold 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of the gross dividends paid on its common shares. In the  la
n
Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act 1965 (Wet op de dividendbelasting 1965), dividends are defined as the proceeds from shares,  c
e
which include:
	Direct or indirect distributions of profit, regardless of their name or form. 
	Liquidation proceeds, proceeds on redemption of Aegon common shares and, as a rule, the consideration for the repurchase of its 
own common shares by Aegon in excess of the average paid-in capital recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, 
unless a particular statutory exemption applies. 
	The nominal value of new common shares issued to a holder of Aegon common shares or an increase of the nominal value of Aegon 
common shares, except insofar as the (increase in the) nominal value of Aegon common shares is funded out of its paid-in capital 
as recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes. 
	Partial repayments of paid-in capital recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, if and to the extent there are  V
a
qualifying profits (zuivere winst), unless Aegon’s General Meeting of Shareholders has resolved in advance to make such repayment  lue
 c
and provided that the nominal value of Aegon common shares concerned has been reduced by an equal amount by way of an  re
a
amendment of the Articles of Association. The term 'qualifying profits' includes anticipated profits that have yet to be realized.  tio
n
US residents
Residents of the United States that qualify for and comply with the procedures for claiming benefits under the Convention between 
the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United States of America for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal 
evasion with respect to taxes on income 1992 (the US/NL Income Tax Treaty) may, under various specified conditions, be eligible 
for a reduction of the Dutch dividend withholding tax rate from 15% to 5% if the resident of the United States is a company which 
holds directly at least 10% of the voting power in Aegon. The US/NL Income Tax Treaty provides, subject to certain conditions, for  C
a complete exemption from, or refund of, Dutch dividend withholding tax for dividends received by exempt pension trusts and exempt  rea
t
organizations, as defined therein. in
g
 s
u
s
Beneficial owner ta
in
A recipient of proceeds from Aegon common shares will not be entitled to any exemption, reduction, refund or credit of Dutch dividend  ab
le
withholding tax if such recipient is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such proceeds. The recipient will not be considered the   v
a
beneficial owner of these proceeds, if, in connection with such proceeds, the recipient has paid a consideration as part of a series  lu
e
of transactions in respect of which it is likely:
	That the proceeds have in whole or in part accumulated, directly or indirectly, to a person or legal entity that would: (i) as opposed 
to the recipient paying the consideration, not be entitled to an exemption from dividend withholding tax; or (ii) in comparison to the 
recipient paying the consideration, to a lesser extent be entitled to a reduction or refund of dividend withholding tax; and
	That such person or legal entity has, directly or indirectly, retained or acquired an interest in Aegon common shares or in profit 
sharing certificates or loans, comparable to the interest it had in similar instruments prior to the series of transactions being  F
in
initiated. an
c
ia
US tax treatment of distributions l in
f
o
The gross amount of any distribution (including any amounts withheld in respect of Dutch withholding tax) actually or constructively  rm
a
received by a US holder with respect to common shares will be taxable to the US holder as a dividend. Such dividends will not qualify  tio
n
for the dividends received deduction otherwise allowable to corporations. The amount of any distribution of property other than cash 
will be the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution.
Certain 'qualified dividend income' received by certain non-corporate US holders is taxed at a maximum income tax rate of 20% 
under current law. Only dividends received from US corporations or from a 'qualified foreign corporation' and on shares held by a 
O
non-corporate US holder for a minimum holding period (generally, 61 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex- th
e
dividend date) can qualify for this reduced rate. Aegon is eligible for benefits under the comprehensive income tax treaty between  r n
o
the Netherlands and the US; therefore, Aegon should be considered a 'qualified foreign corporation' for this purpose. Accordingly,  n
-
f
dividends paid by Aegon to non-corporate US holders on shares held for the minimum holding period may qualify for a reduced income  in
a
n
tax rate. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the applicable tax rate. c
ia
l in
f
In addition, US holders receiving dividends may be subject to a net investment income tax (NIIT). The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser  o
rm
of net investment income or the amount of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) that is over a threshold amount based on filing  a
t
status (USD 250,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding applicability  ion
of the NIIT. 
Aegon Integrated Annual Report 2020
412 Additional information Taxation 413
Distributions paid in currency other than US dollars (a 'foreign currency'), including the amount of any withholding tax thereon, 
A A
t a must be included in the gross income of a US holder in an amount equal to the US dollar value of the foreign currency calculated  t a
 g  g
la by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. This is the case regardless of whether the foreign currency  la
n n
c is converted into US dollars. If the foreign currency is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, a US holder generally should  c
e e
not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend. If the foreign currency received in the distribution 
is not converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, a US holder will have a basis in the foreign currency equal to its US dollar 
value on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the foreign currency will be treated 
as ordinary income or loss.
Dividends received by a US holder with respect to common shares will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit 
limitation purposes. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, any Dutch income tax withheld on dividends may be deducted from 
taxable income or credited against a US holder’s Federal income tax liability. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for the US foreign 
V tax credit is calculated separately with respect to 'passive category income' and 'general category income'. Dividends distributed  V
a a
lue by Aegon generally will constitute 'passive category income', or, in the case of certain US holders, 'financial services income', which  lue
 c  c
re is treated as general category income. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit  re
a a
tio under their particular circumstances. tio
n n
The amount of the qualified dividend income paid by Aegon to a US holder that is subject to the reduced dividend income tax rate and 
that is taken into account for purposes of calculating the US holder's US foreign tax credit limitation must be reduced by the 'rate 
differential portion' of such dividend. Each US holder should consult their tax advisor regarding the implications of the rules relating 
to qualified dividend income on the calculation of US foreign tax credits under their particular circumstances.
C In general, upon making a distribution to shareholders, Aegon is required to remit all Dutch dividend withholding taxes to the Dutch  C
rea tax authorities. The full amount of the taxes so withheld should (subject to certain limitations and conditions) be eligible for  rea
t t
in the US holder's foreign tax deduction or credit as described above. Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding  in
g g
 su the general creditability or deductibility of Dutch withholding taxes.  su
s s
t t
a a
in in
ab Aegon generally affords shareholders an option to receive dividend distributions in cash or in stock. A distribution of additional  ab
le le
 v common shares to US holders with respect to their common shares that is made pursuant to such an election will generally be taxable   v
a a
lu in the same manner as a cash dividend under the rules described above. lu
e e
Sale or other disposition of shares
Upon the sale or exchange of common shares, a US holder will generally recognize gain or loss for US Federal income tax purposes 
on the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized from such sale or exchange and the tax basis in those common 
shares. This gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will generally be treated as from sources within the United States. Investors 
F should consult their tax advisors with respect to the treatment of capital gains (which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary  F
in in
an income for taxpayers who are individuals, trusts or estates that have held the common shares for more than one year) and capital  an
c c
ia losses (the deductibility of which is subject to limitations). ia
l in l in
f f
o o
rm In addition, US holders with capital gains may be subject to a NIIT. The NIIT is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of net investment income  rm
a a
tio or the amount that is over a threshold amount based on filing status (USD 250,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). Each US holder  tio
n n
should consult their tax advisor regarding applicability of the NIIT.
If a US holder receives foreign currency upon a sale or exchange of common shares, gain or loss, if any, recognized on the subsequent 
sale, conversion or disposition of such foreign currency will be ordinary income or loss, and will generally be income or loss from 
sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. However, if such foreign currency is converted into 
O O
th US dollars on the date received by the US holder, the US holder generally should not be required to recognize any gain or loss  th
e e
r n on such conversion. r n

f f
in Passive foreign investment company considerations in
a a
n n
c Based on the nature of Aegon’s gross income, the average value of Aegon’s gross assets and the active conduct of Aegon’s insurance  c
ia ia
l in business, Aegon does not believe that it could be classified as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). If Aegon were treated as a  l in
f f
o PFIC in any year during which a US holder owns common shares, certain adverse tax consequences could apply. Investors should consult  o
rm rm
a their tax advisors with respect to any PFIC considerations. a

Tax consequences to non-US holders
A
A non-US holder generally will not be subject to US Federal income tax on dividends received on common shares or on any gain realized  t a
 g
on the sale or exchange of common shares unless the gain is connected with a trade or business that the non-US holder conducts  la
n
in the United States or unless the non-US holder is an individual, such holder was present in the United States for at least 183 days  c
e
during the year in which such holder disposes of the common shares, and certain other conditions are satisfied. Non-US holders should 
consult their tax advisors with respect to the US Federal income tax consequences of dividends received on, and any gain realized from 
the sale or exchange of, the common shares.
US withholding and information reporting
Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments on the common shares and to proceeds 
of a sale or redemption of the common shares to US holders made within the United States. Aegon, its agent, a broker, or any paying 
agent, as the case may be, may be required to withhold tax from any payment that is subject to backup withholding if a US holder fails 
to furnish the US holder's taxpayer identification number, fails to certify that such US holder is not subject to backup withholding,  V
a
or fails to otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain US holders are not subject  lue
 c
to the backup withholding and information reporting requirements. re
a
t
io
n
US and non-US holders may also be subject to withholding and/or reporting to the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) 
if they do not provide required documentation and certifications to the appropriate reporting agent. When documentation and 
certifications are required, they will generally be requested by the appropriate reporting agent.
Backup withholding and withholding under FATCA are not additional taxes. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules 
from a payment to a US holder or a non-US holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such holder's US Federal income tax 
liability provided that the required information is furnished to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Investors should consult their tax  C
advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and withholding under FATCA. rea
t
in
g
Individual US holders may be required to report to the IRS certain information with respect to their beneficial ownership of certain   su
s
foreign financial assets, such as the common shares, if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds USD 50,000 and the assets are not  ta
in
held through a US financial institution. US holders who fail to report required information could be subject to substantial penalties.  ab
le
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the information reporting rules to their   v
a
particular circumstances. lu

3  Responsible Investment Solutions (RIS) are investment strategies that go beyond ESG integration to pursue competitive financial returns by incorporating specific  in
ESG or sustainability criteria. In 2019, Aegon AM formalized its responsible investment principles and developed a common terminology. AM’s responsible  ab
investment solutions span four key categories: exclusions, best-in-class, sustainability-themed and impact investments. This AuM reporting methodology was  le
updated in 2019 and is reflected in the data shown on this page.  va
4  Please note, there is often no direct correlation between tax reported on earnings for any given year and amounts paid or received in tax. Part of the explanation for  lu
e
this is that certain tax-deductible items are not recognized in the Company’s profit & loss statement but directly in equity. Additionally payments and refunds for 
prior years can impact the amounts paid or received in the current year. The US corporate income tax refund is related to refundable minimum tax credits generated 
in prior years. Furthermore, the 2020 US tax liability will be satisfied entirely by losses carryforwards and tax credits, including low income housing tax credits.
5  GHG emissions have been calculated based on energy consumption and air travel for the US, the UK and the Netherlands, and extraolated to cover the headcount 
of our remaining in-scope business units. Under the market-based calculation methodology prescribed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, electricity consumption in 
the US has been accounted as zero-carbon through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). A significant proportion of electricity consumed in the 
UK and the Netherlands is procured on a ‘green tariff’ basis which has also been accounted as zero-carbon. Aegon’s operations in US, UK and the Netherlands 
have been carbon neutral since August 2016 through offsetting our remaining market-based GHG emissions by supporting projects in Brazil, China and Turkey.

1.   We will embed in our decision-making  ESG is integrated in how we operate. Aegon has its Responsible Business and Investment 
environmental, social and governance (ESG)  Committee, consisting of relevant Management Board members, Chief Investment 
issues relevant to the insurance business. Officers and senior management. They discuss ESG matters related to the business and 
investing on a quarterly basis, and provide advice to Aegon’s Executive Board. Addition-
ally, as per our Executive Board’s Remuneration Policy, 50% of a member’s variable 
compensation is related to non-financial performance indicators, of which at least one 
must be ESG-related and clearly support the wider interests of society. New as of 
January 1, 2021, is the Global Head of Corporate Sustainability function, which was 
created to further embed ESG into how Aegon operates.
V Our public ESG policies and frameworks are available at aegon.com. In 2020, Aegon  V
a a
lu made a concerted effort to update the Human Rights Statement and the Vendor Code  lu
e of Conduct, to reflect current best practice.  e
 c  c
re re
a ESG risks are covered by Aegon’s risk universe and in 2020 climate risk was more  a
t t
io explicitly recognized in the risk universe, given its increasing relevance and the need to  io
n manage the impact on Aegon’s risk profile. Risk management regularly interacts and  n
cooperates on ESG risks, including climate risk, with the Global Corporate Sustainability 
Team reporting into the CEO and the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG) of the 
Responsible Business and Investment Committee chaired by a member of Aegon’s 
Management Board. This is covered in more detail in the Responsible Business section 
and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section of this report. 
Of note for 2020 were the recognition of climate change and loss of biodiversity as 
material topics in the Aegon Business Environment Scan.
Through our products we offer financial solutions for vulnerable groups in, for example,

2.   We will work together with our clients and  For clients, guided by our overarching Responsible Investment Policy, Aegon Asset 
business partners to raise awareness of ESG  Management (AAM) has established a Responsible Investment Framework that reflects 
issues, manage risk and develop solutions. these key elements including similar policies put forward by AAM’s clients.
Our Responsible Investment Framework is structured as follows:
1.   ESG integration – Material ESG factors are fundamental to our investment 
decision-making across all AAM portfolios. By integrating ESG considerations into 
F traditional financial analysis, the AAM research team arrives at an independent view  F
ina of an issuer’s fundamentals. ina
nc 2.   Active ownership – We actively engage with investee companies across a wide range  nc
ia of industries to improve their ESG profile and address sustainability issues, often in  ia
l in cooperation with other investors to maximize our influence. We also exercise any  l in
fo shareholder voting rights we have to support our engagement efforts and enhance  fo
rm long-term value creation for all stakeholders. rm
at 3.   Solutions – AAM provides a range of responsible investment solutions to pursue  at
io ESG objectives alongside financial returns. These solutions are categorized into four  io
n n
types: exclusion-based strategies, best-in-class strategies, sustainability-themed 
strategies, and impact investments.
For vendors, in 2020, we replaced Aegon’s previous Sustainable Procurement Policy 
with a new Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets out the minimum standards our 
partners must commit to. This document reflects the consistent approach to 
 responsible business that we aim to foster throughout our organization.
O O
t t
he We have started using SAP Ariba, a vendor lifecycle management platform for  he
r n registering third parties and monitoring them through data feeds. Moreover, Aegon is  r n
o an early adopter of Ariba Risk Management technology, which supports our third party  o
n n

In addition, Aegon now works with an external assessment company, EcoVadis, that 
evaluates the ESG risks involved in our partnerships with suppliers. The EcoVadis  A
t
assessment categories are aligned with the standards laid out in our Vendor Code of   a
Conduct, including key topics such as a supplier’s environmental policies and their labor,   gla
human rights, and ethics record. The EcoVadis results can be integrated into our Ariba  n
platform, creating greater oversight of a vendor’s ESG credentials. This partnership  ce
allows us to take a more proactive approach to responsible business. Should the 
external assessment reveal that a partner falls short of our expectations, we can work 
with them on corrective actions. We believe that this new system for risk management 
gives us more comprehensive oversight of our partners’ ESG policies, actions, and 
results. We are now better able to choose suppliers we can trust, and thus to be a good 
corporate citizen, creating sustainable value for the societies we operate in. In 2020, 
we decided that we would assess our top 250 vendors by spend (representing 80% of 
Aegon’s total procurement spend).

and engages with individuals and policymakers in service of helping people to achieve  n
wealth and health wherever we can. Aegon is active in many international projects that 
aim to fulfill this goal; for example, an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) working group on the future of work, and the Living, Learning, and 
Earning Longer initiative led by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the OECD, and 
US-based retirement interest group AARP. Within Aegon, our Silver Starters program 
(developed jointly with the Leyden Academy on Vitality and Ageing) provides online 
entrepreneurship coaching to over- 50s, to promote lifelong learning and healthy 
attitudes to aging.
