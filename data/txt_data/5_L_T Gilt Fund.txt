FUTURE MARKET OUTLOOK(cid:2)(cid:2)
 
Equity Market Overview and Outlook 
 
Despite some of the worst conditions led by a pandemic, the Nifty ended FY’21 with a strong return of 
71%. The return looks stellar due to the low base of FY’20 when markets fell 26%. Again, surprisingly, 
all four quarters of the year saw positive returns from the nifty and all sectors delivered positive returns 
during the year. The Nifty Midcap 100 and the Nifty Smallcap 100 indices outperformed the Nifty with 
a 102% YoY and 126% YoY return respectively. The best performers among sectors were metals with 
Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021      3
L&T Gilt Fund
151% gain, autos with 108%, technology with 103% and real estate with 90%, while the consumer sector 
underperformed. FII flows in equities in FY’21 were the highest ever at US$ 37.6bln. 
  
After the Covid led sharp correction in Mar’20, markets gradually recouped its losses in FY’21, led by 
policy measures from governments and central banks, as well as a better than expected corporate 
earnings performance. Equity markets probably bottomed out in March 2020 with the steep fall which 
looks like a final capitulation after a prolonged bear phase across the broad market over the previous 
two  years.  During  the  lockdowns,  stronger,  organised  players  took  advantage  of  technology 
advancements and gained disproportionate market share from the unorganised and weaker players. 
Demand was bunched up in many sectors, which manifested itself eventually, as lockdowns were 
relaxed. Along with this, the unprecedented speed of development of vaccines saw markets moving 
from gloom to strength resulting in indices scaling new highs.  
 
The recovery in economic growth and markets could be seen as a new cycle that has begun, with GDP 
growth, interest rates, capacity utilisation levels, capex, corporate profitability & earnings growth all 
touching multi year lows in the first quarter of the year. An expansion phase supported by central banks 
pledging low interest rates for long augurs well for equity markets. Three key trends are visible in this 
period similar to past cycles. First, cyclical stocks and sectors are gaining traction. This trend is also 
helped by the government thrust on investments. Within the Nifty in FY’21, the best five performers 
belonged to the cyclical space while the bottom five are dominated by defensive stocks. Second, after 
several years of outperformance of growth over value in the market, value as a style has begun to 
outperform and have done meaningfully better, especially in the second half of the year. Third, the 
broad market has started outperforming the large caps after a two to three year under performance.    
 
During the correction and in the first quarter of FY’21, markets cut earnings forecasts drastically and 
thus in contrast to the last several years, the growth expectation at the beginning of the year was quite 
subdued. Subsequent upgrades to earnings growth were the result of market share gains, operating 
leverage, cost savings etc. The fourth quarter is expected to be a bumper quarter given a very low base 
and sustained recovery. Nifty earnings is expected to grow between 13-15% in FY’21 which is the best 
in six years.  
 
Valuation of the Nifty have now reached above long term average levels and a further up move in the 
index will need earnings growth catch up. One of the fallouts of very low interest rates is that high 
quality defensive stocks have been rerated to exorbitant valuations given low cost of capital. Hence the 
differential between defensive and cyclical valuations continue to remain high despite the move in 
cyclical stocks during the year.    
 
Outlook 
While earnings growth should remain fairly strong in FY’22 with the low base of FY’21 and the recovery, 
over the last few days India has seen a severe second wave with a sharp rise Covid cases. The possibility 
of lockdowns cannot be ruled out which could have an impact on the recovery, depending on how long 
these last. Hence this would be a key variable to watch out for, especially as the expectation of a strong 
recovery and earnings growth of close to 30% for the Nifty in FY’22 is already factored by markets. The 
pace of vaccination will also assume critical importance in this context.  
 
From a global perspective, as the vaccination drive progresses, the recovery should gain momentum 
which has led to markets fearing that interest rates will reverse and start moving up. While the 
downtrend in rates is now possibly done, the current view is that central banks are likely to maintain an 
4      Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021
L&T Gilt Fund
accommodative stance in the foreseeable future, possibly the whole of this year. In India also, interest 
rates are likely to remain low for the year and a growth supportive policy framework should continue 
for some time as has been articulated by the central bank. This could mean that liquidity and risk 
appetite in the equity markets would sustain. However, investors should pay heed to economic data 
and central bank narratives to assess the risk of a reversal.  
 
As of now, one is hopeful of expeditious containment of Covid19 cases and accelerated pace of 
vaccination which means that the moderation in growth, if any, is only a speed breaker. With this view, 
the improvement in the broad market is expected to continue in FY’22. Given the rich valuations, any 
miss on earnings delivery may act as a dampener. 
 
Debt Market Overview and Outlook 
 
The past year has been fairly volatile across asset classes, both globally and from a domestic 
perspective. With the impact of the pandemic seen spreading across the world, Governments and 
Central Banks globally faced the challenge of curbing the spread of the virus on one hand, while taking 
adequate steps to revive the dwindling growth and keeping inflation in check. Unprecedented times 
called for unconventional approach. While Governments provided the quintessential impetus to growth 
through fiscal stimulus, Central Banks turned accommodative. Policy rate cuts were supported by 
providing surplus liquidity to the system and absorbing bond supply through monetary policy tools.  
 
In this backdrop, the Union budget of FY2022 was one of the most anticipated Budgets in the last few 
years. The Government faced a dilemma of either propelling growth through incremental spending or 
continue on the path of fiscal consolidation. However, the Government picked growth over fiscal 
consolidation. With an increase in capital expenditure and a strong disinvestment pipeline, Government 
looks set to achieve this target. However, a push to growth also meant to deviate from the fiscal deficit 
glide path. The revised fiscal deficit for FY2021 was set at 9.5% (against initial estimate of 3.5%) and the 
fiscal deficit for FY2022 is set at 6.8% of GDP, with a gross borrowing number of ~ INR 12 lakh Crs. The 
fiscal deficit is expected to reach 4.5% by FY2026. 
 
The 10-year US Treasury yield moved from 0.67% to 1.74% during FY2021 (while reaching a low of 
0.51%). While the first 9 months saw 10-year US Treasury yields remain below 1%, however with 
markets expecting a faster revival in inflation and possible tapering earlier than expected, the last 
couple of months saw a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Crude prices moved from USD 23/bbl to USD 
64/bbl during FY2021. Like US Treasury, Crude remained below USD 50/bbl for the first 8 months of the 
year. However, with green shoots visible in growth and investors moving from other asset classes to 
commodities as part of the global reflation trade, the last few months saw a sharp rise in Crude prices. 
   
During the year the MPC cut Repo rate by 40 bps (4% currently) and Reverse Repo rate by 65 bps (3.35% 
currently), thereby increasing the LAF corridor to 65 bps. With the system in surplus liquidity throughout 
the year, the operative rate is currently the Reverse Repo. The 10-year G-Sec moved from 6.14% to 
6.17% (while reaching a low of 5.75%) over the year. Meanwhile 10 yr AAA PSU Corporate bonds moved 
from 7.16% to 6.83% (while reaching a low of 6.36%) over the year. 3 yr AAA PSU Corporate bonds 
moved from 6.45% to 5.37% (while reaching a low of 4.47%). Although CPI inflation remained above 
the mandated band of 4% (+/- 2%) for 8 consecutive months, with food prices easing inflation has come 
off in the past few months. However, core inflation has remained sticky and is expected to remain so in 
the near future.

(cid:2)(cid:2) For the first time ever, RBI conducted INR 30,000 Crs OMO purchase in SDLs from the market 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Increased the HTM category for Banks from 19.5% to 22% of NDTL with respect to SLR securities, 
and allowed this dispensation till March 2023 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Conducted TLTRO worth ~ INR 88,000 Crs in FY2021to enable funding to specific stressed sectors 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Retail investors allowed to participate in G-Sec market, both in primary and secondary market 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Conducted 14-day Variable Rate Reverse Repo auctions to bring overnight rates close to the 
Reverse Repo 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Provided special liquidity facility to All India Financial Institutions 
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in their latest bi-monthly policy on April 07, 2021 came out with 
the following key announcements: 
(cid:2)(cid:2) The MPC members unanimously voted for keeping the policy rates unchanged 
(cid:2)(cid:2) The MPC also unanimously decided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as 
necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-
19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remained within the target going forward 
(cid:2)(cid:2) The MPC retained their expectation of real GDP growth at 10.5% for FY2022 
(cid:2)(cid:2) The projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5% for Q4 FY2021, 5.2% in H1 FY2022, 4.4% 
in Q3 FY2022 and 5.1% in Q4 FY2022 
The Governor also made two very important announcements in his address: 
(cid:2)(cid:2) Given the success of the Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions and the rising surplus 
liquidity in the system, RBI announced to further conduct VRRR auctions of longer maturity. 
However, the RBI reiterated that this should not be considered as liquidity tightening 
(cid:2)(cid:2) The Governor announced a secondary market G-Sec acquisition program (G-SAP 1.0), where the 
RBI will upfront commit to a specific amount of open market purchases of G-Sec in order to 
ensure orderly evolution of yield curve. For Q1 FY2022, G-SAP of INR 1 lakh Crs will be 
conducted, the first of which will be conducted for an amount of INR 25,000 Crs on April 15, 
2021. Separately, the RBI will continue to use other tools under LAF, long term repo/reverse 
repo auctions, FX operations, OMOs and special OMOs as and when required 
Although, the recent surge in COVID-19 infections has added uncertainty to the domestic growth 
outlook, India looks better prepared to meet the challenges posed by resurgence in infections. The 
Governor in his most recent monetary policy speech provided markets with confidence by stating that 
“Fiscal and monetary authorities stand ready to act in a coordinated manner to limit its spillovers to the 
economy at large and contain its fallout on the ongoing recovery”. 
 
Overall, the RBI governor has been very articulate in his communication that the RBI and MPC stand 
ready to support growth in the face of the second wave of pandemic, and will ensure that the bond 
market functions in an orderly manner, with adequate provision of liquidity. While this does provide 
6      Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021
L&T Gilt Fund
much needed comfort to market participants, especially for yields at the longer end of the curve via the 
newly announced GSAP 1.0 program, the announcement regarding the longer tenor variable rate 
reverse repos (VRRR) does suggest that RBI is moving in a calibrated manner towards nudging up levels 
at the shorter end of the curve. Yields at the extreme short end have been trading close to the reverse 
repo rate with hardly any reward in the 0-6 month part of the curve. Effective implementation of the 
VRRR can gradually push up the term premia in the money market part of the curve, leading to a gradual 
flattening of the yield curve, which so far has been extremely steep.  
 
Yields in the short to medium (2-3 years) part of the curve have moved higher over past few months,  
thereby offering better value for investors looking for some yield pickup over other money market 
segments.  For investors with a long term horizon of 3 years and more, the steepness of the curve – 
especially between the 3 year and 7 year segment of the curve – is very attractive, and yields in the 7 
year segment offer substantial cushion to be able to offset the impact from the upward move in rates 
which is likely over the coming few years.  Spreads on less liquid AAA securities and some of the good 
quality AA securities still remain attractive, and in an environment of interest rates trending higher, a 
strategy which delivers better yield pickup through judicious exposure to such securities, while still 
keeping duration moderate – are well suited for investors with a 3 year + horizon.

Voting policies and procedures      
30      Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021
L&T Gilt Fund
1. Introduction 
Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI), vide circular ref. SEBI/IMD/Cir No. 18/198647/2010 
dated March 15, 2010 stipulated that mutual fund should play an active role in ensuring better 
corporate governance of listed Companies. In this regard, SEBI has mandated that, Asset 
Management Companies shall disclose their policy and procedure, for exercising the voting rights 
in respect of shares held on behalf of the mutual funds on their website as well as in the annual 
reports of the schemes. This document is drafted in pursuance of the above referred circular and 
clarificatory email received from SEBI on June 23, 2011.  
The purpose of this document is to disclose general policies and procedures followed by L&T 
Investment Management Limited (LTIML) for exercising the voting rights in respect of shares held 
in the schemes of L&T Mutual Fund (the Fund). LTIML understands its fiduciary duty to exercise 
its vote judiciously, on behalf of, and in the best interest of the unit holders of the fund. It further 
appreciates that voting decisions may affect the value of shareholdings.   
2. General Voting Principles and Application 
LTIML shall review all proposals, even though that may be considered to be routine matters. 
Since, LTIML endeavors to effectively manage its investment process and corporate governance 
responsibilities, in all cases each proposal will be considered based on the relevant facts and 
circumstances and in the best interest of the unit-holders. 
LTIML will generally follow the below mentioned voting guidelines: 
1. Corporate Governance matters (including changes in the state of incorporation, merger and 
other  corporate  restructuring  and  anti-takeover  provisions):  Mergers  and  acquisitions  and 
corporate restructuring proposals will be subject to appropriate review on a case-by-case basis 
to determine whether they would be beneficial to shareholders’ interest. LTIML votes against anti-
takeover  proposals  but  will  consider  supporting  measures  for  time  periods  in  special 
circumstances. 
2. Changes to capital structure (including increases or decreases of capital and preferred stock 
issuances): The proposals for approval to alter the capital structure of the company, such as an 
increase in authorized capital will generally be supported unless the same is considered to be 
unusual or excessive. LTIML does not generally favour shares with restricted or differential voting 
rights.  
Voting policies and procedures      
Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021      31
L&T Gilt Fund
3. Stock option plans and other management compensation issues: LTIML would generally 
support proposals for Employee Stock option plans and other management compensation plans, 
but would oppose stock option plans and compensation, if it feels that approval of the plan would 
be against shareholder interest by virtue of being excessively dilutive or seen as giving undue 
advantage to the management.  
4. Corporate Social Responsibilities: LTIML believes in management discretion with regard to 
social and environmental issues and would generally support proposals on social issues that have 
demonstrable socio-economic benefits.  
5. Appointment and Removal of Directors: The foundation of good corporate governance is in the 
selection of responsible and qualified, Independent Directors that are likely to diligently represent 
the interest of the shareholders and oversee management of the Company in the manner that will 
seek to maximize shareholder value over time. LTIML would generally support the Board’s 
nominees in the election of Directors and generally support proposals that strengthen the 
independence of Board of Directors. However, each such proposal shall be evaluated on a case-
by-case basis.  
LTIML will generally vote in accordance with the above guidelines, but may act differently if the 
relevant facts and circumstances so warrant in the interests of the shareholders.  
Exceptionally, LTIML may also decide to abstain where it does not have sufficient information or 
where LTIML wish to give a cautionary message to a Company. LTIML may also decide to abstain 
from voting for holdings in schemes which follow a passive philosophy towards investment. 
3. Voting procedures 
Voting in respect of proposals covered by these guidelines shall be executed by LTIML’s 
Investment Operations team or Custodian based on voting instructions received from the 
Investment Management Team. The analyst team frame the analysis of each proxy proposal and 
in evaluating votes, the analyst team may consider information from many sources, including a 
company’s management, shareholder groups, proxy voting advisors and various research and 
data resources, etc. Proposals not covered by these guidelines would be evaluated by the 
Investment Management team of LTIML. LTIML may utilize the services of third party professional 
agencies for getting in-depth analysis of proposals and recommendations on voting.  
Voting policies and procedures      
32      Abridged Annual Report 2020-2021
L&T Gilt Fund
 In case if the voting done by LTIML is at a variance from the recommendation provided by the 
service provider, approval will be obtained from either the Head of Equities or the Chief Executive 
Officer. LTIML retains the discretion to vote directly, wherever feasible. 
There may be situations in which LTIML may be unable to vote, or may choose not to vote, 
examples of such cases are : (i) proxy ballot not received from the Custodian of the schemes of 
the Fund, (ii) notice of the meeting received too late; (iii) fees being imposed upon the exercise 
of a vote and it is determined that such fees outweigh the benefit of voting; (iv) there being legal 
encumbrances to voting, including blocking restrictions in certain markets that preclude the ability 
to dispose of a security if LTIML votes or where LTIML is prohibited from voting by applicable law 
or other regulatory or market requirements, including but not limited to, effective Powers of 
Attorney; (v) the Fund holding shares on the record date but the same been sold prior to the date 
of the meeting; (vi) proxy voting service not offered by the Custodian of the Fund in the relevant 
market; etc. 
4. Conflict of Interest 
LTIML recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest (may be in form of the company 
being a group / associate company or the company having investments in the schemes of the 
Fund) when it votes on an entity with which LTIML may have a significant relationship. In such 
cases, LTIML will ensure to vote in the interest of the unit holders and in accordance with the 
guidelines  stated  herein.  All  investments  by  the  schemes  are  made  based  on  strong 
fundamentals of a Company. The Investment Manager may also decide to abstain from such 
voting, if it deems fit to do so in the best interest of the unit holders or if there is conflict of interest.  
While most votes will be determined in accordance with the present policy on voting and 
disclosure there may be circumstances when analyst will refer proxy issues to the Conflict 
Management Committee (“the Committee”) for consideration. The Investment Team is expected 
to determine and address potential or actual conflicts of interest that may be presented by a 
particular proxy and escalate such potential or actual conflicts to the Committee. LTIM will allow 
for employee(s) to recuse from decision making in case of the employee(s) having any 
actual/potential conflict of interest in the proxy voting decisions. 
The Constitution of the Committee shall be as under:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To The Board of Directors of L&T Mutual Fund Trustee Limited
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying ﬁ nancial statements of the undermentioned Debt schemes of L&T Mutual Fund (the “Fund”), which comprise the Balance Sheets 
as at March 31, 2021,  the Revenue Accounts and  the Cash Flow Statements for the year then ended on that date, and a summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies 
and other explanatory information:
•  L&T Ultra Short Term Fund
•  L&T Money Market Fund
•  L&T Liquid Fund
•  L&T Triple Ace Bond Fund
•  L&T Credit Risk Fund
•  L&T Short Term Bond Fund
•  L&T Overnight Fund (formerly known as L&T Cash Fund)
•  L&T Flexi Bond Fund
•  L&T Banking and PSU Debt Fund
•  L&T Gilt Fund
•  L&T Conservative Hybrid Fund
•  L&T Resurgent India Bond Fund
•  L&T Low Duration Fund
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the ﬁ nancial statements give the information required by the Securi-
ties and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 as amended (the “SEBI Regulations”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, as applicable: 
(a)     in the case of the Balance Sheets, of the state of aﬀ airs of the Schemes as at March 31, 2021;
(b)     in the case of the Revenue Accounts, of the Surplus/(Deﬁ cit) of the Schemes for the year ended on that date; and
(c)     in the case of the Cash Flow Statements, of the cash ﬂ ows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(“ICAI”) as applicable to the schemes. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. In conducting our audit we have taken into account the provisions of the SEBI Regulations, the accounting standards issued by the 
ICAI, as applicable, accounting principles generally accepted in India and matters which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the 
SEBI Regulations.  We are independent of the schemes in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements, and 
we have fulﬁ lled our other responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is suﬃ  cient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁ cance in our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Managements of L&T Mutual Fund Trustee Limited (the “Trustee Company”) and L&T Investment Management Limited (the “AMC” / “Investment Manager”) 
are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Trustee Report and Abridged Financial Statements of L&T Mutual Fund, but does not 
include these ﬁ nancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of these ﬁ nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identiﬁ ed above when it becomes available and, in do-
ing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁ nancial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein of this other information, we are required to report the fact. We  
have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Managements of the Investment Manager and the Trustee Company are responsible for the preparation of these ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows of the Schemes in accordance with accounting policies and standards as speciﬁ ed in the Ninth 
Schedule of the SEBI Regulations and in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes the maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the SEBI Regulations for safeguarding the assets 
of the Schemes and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal ﬁ nancial controls, that were operating eﬀ ectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, managements of the Investment Manager and the Trustee Company are responsible for assessing the Scheme’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the schemes, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Managements of the Investment Manager and the Trustee Company are responsible for overseeing the Schemes’ ﬁ nancial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁ nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁ nancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁ nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures respon-
sive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suﬃ  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstate-
ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•  Obtain an understanding of internal ﬁ nancial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eﬀ ectiveness of the Schemes’ internal ﬁ nancial control.
•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a mate-
rial uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁ cant doubt on the Scheme’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Scheme to cease to continue as a going concern.

L&T Gilt Fund
•  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁ nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the ﬁ nancial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the ﬁ nancial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reason-
ably knowledgeable user of the ﬁ nancial statements may be inﬂ uenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the eﬀ ect of any identiﬁ ed misstatements in the ﬁ nancial statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiﬁ cant audit ﬁ ndings, 
including any signiﬁ cant deﬁ ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to com-
municate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signiﬁ cance in the audit of the ﬁ nancial state-
ments of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁ ts of such communication. 
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
1.     As required by Regulation 55, and Clause 5 of the Eleventh Schedule to the SEBI Regulations, we report that:
a)   we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit; 
b)   the Balance Sheets, the Revenue Accounts and the Cash Flow Statements dealt with by this report are in agreement with the books of account of the 
Schemes; and
c)    the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies and standards as speciﬁ ed in the Ninth Schedule of the SEBI Regu-
lations.
2.     As r equired by the Clause 2 (ii) of Eighth Schedule of the SEBI Regulations, we report that, there are no non-traded securities as at the year end.
