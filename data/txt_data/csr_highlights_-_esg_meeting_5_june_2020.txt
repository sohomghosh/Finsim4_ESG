Publication of BNP Paribas’ first TCFD report
 Since 2011, BNP Paribas has been strongly engaged in the fight against climate change and works to align its
activity with the objectives set by the Paris Climate Agreement. BNP Paribas has therefore endeavoured for
several years to identify, analyse, and manage the climate-related risks and opportunities for the Group and its
clients;
 In 2017, BNP Paribas CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafé publicly supported
the release of the final recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures), which have been supported and
implemented by the Group since then;
 Also, within BNP Paribas, Jane Ambachtsheer (Global Head of
Sustainability, BNP Paribas Asset Management) and Mark Lewis
(Global Head of Sustainability Research, BNP Paribas Asset
Management) are both members of the TCFD;
 On May 18th, 2020, BNP Paribas published its first dedicated and stand-
alone TCFD report, which represents an additional step toward leading
this alignment with constructive transparency.

SDG #13 – Aligning portfolios with the Paris Agreement goals 
 THE KATOWICE COMMITMENT
 During the COP24 in Katowice, BNP Paribas, BBVA, ING, Société Générale and Standard Chartered made a historic 
commitment: pledging to measure the climate alignment of their lending portfolios, and to explore ways to progressively 
steer financial flows through their core lending towards the Paris Agreement’s goals
 ALIGNING THE BANK’S LENDING PORTFOLIOS WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT GOALS
 BNP Paribas works together with other signatory banks to test and recommend ways to
improve the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology
developed by the 2 Degrees Investing Initiative, so as to provide open-source
methodologies and tools that can be used by all banks. In 2020 the finalized IP rights
free, open source software will be released, enabling any bank to carry out the analysis.
 BNPParibas has been continuouslyand intensively working on this project for its own activities
• As of 2019, the Group uses the PACTA methodology to calculate its loan book’s profile at various maturity dates for five
high-carbon sectors (extraction of fossil fuels, electricity generation, transport, steel production and cement production)
• The method, tailored to each sector, employs benchmark scenarios used and developed by independent organizations
such as the International EnergyAgency (IEA)
• The Group is now focusing its efforts not only on improving the percentage and quality of client coverage, but also gaining a
better understandingof projected trends in each sector
