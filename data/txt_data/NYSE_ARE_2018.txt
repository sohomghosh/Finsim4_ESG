EXECUTIVE 
CHAIRMAN & 
FOUNDER LETTER TO 
STAKEHOLDERS
I am extremely proud to report that 2018 was a stellar year of operating and financial performance for our  
first-in-class company and team. Our team is family and core to all we do—we provide best-in-class ecosystems and 
campuses, invest to support the creation of cures for human diseases, curate impactful thought leadership, and implement 
leading environmental, social, and governance practices. We are truly making the life-changing work of today’s innovators 
possible. Congratulations and thank you to each and every one of our talented team members who come to work every day 
with unwavering dedication to operational excellence and a tremendous commitment to our people, passion, and purpose.
Since founding Alexandria in 1994 as a garage startup with a totally unique strategic business plan, $19 million in 
Series A capital, and a vision to create a new kind of real estate company focused on serving the life science industry, 
we have grown remarkably into an investment-grade rated S&P 500® company with a total market capitalization of 
approximately $18.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. With a view to the future, we continue to execute on our unique and 
differentiated business strategy; invest in our leading franchise and in technology; attract, mentor, and retain top, egoless 
talent; and monetize our unmatched assets.
DIFFERENTIATED, MULTIFACETED, AND MISSION-DRIVEN BUSINESS MODEL
Our incredible growth over the last 25 years was catalyzed by our bold strategic decision—
informed by Harvard Business Professor Michael E. Porter’s cluster theory and initially 
implemented during 2004–2006—to shift our focus from a single-asset strategy to a 
cluster campus strategy as the first mover in Mission Bay, New York City, and Cambridge. 
This strategic decision preceded today’s mega trend of urbanization to foster innovation 
and collaboration and has positioned Alexandria from first mover to dominant leader in 
developing collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA innovation 
cluster  locations  that  enable  and  inspire  the  world’s  most  brilliant  minds  to  develop  
life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs to improve human health. 
Our successful execution of this strategy continues to deepen our competitive advantage 
and distinguish Alexandria from all other office REITs. For over 20 years, since our initial 
public offering (IPO) on May 27, 1997, we have maintained our primary business objective 
of maximizing long-term value and growth in net asset value, funds from operations, and 
dividends. Alexandria’s exceptional total shareholder return (TSR, assuming reinvestment 
of dividends) from the time of our IPO through December 31, 2018, exceeded 1,200%, 
JOEL S. MARCUS
significantly outperforming various indices, including the MSCI US REIT’s 525% TSR and 
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN  
the S&P 500’s 342% TSR, over the same time period. 
& FOUNDER
We are honored to be recognized as the brand of choice among innovative life science, 
technology, and agtech companies. Our business decisions, which have helped shape the company’s differentiated and 
multifaceted business model, are driven by Alexandria’s distinctive mission to support the world’s leading innovators 
to advance human and improve quality of life. Our mission also unifies Alexandria’s four business verticals: real estate, 
corporate responsibility, thought leadership, and venture investments. 
BEST-IN-CLASS, LONG-TENURED TEAM AND MISSION-DRIVEN CULTURE CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE
At the center of Alexandria’s most important assets is our people. Their dedication as a best-in-class team and their 
sustained commitment to operational excellence enable the company’s outstanding achievements. We will continue to 
uphold the egoless idea-based meritocracy culture where such excellence thrives and continue to operate at the highest 
standards of integrity and ethical behavior.
Over the past few years, our team has had the privilege of working with renowned author and business strategist 
2  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Jim Collins to examine tangible frameworks for understanding why organizations and leaders succeed. Out of his deep 
understanding of our business and what makes us successful, he has affirmed our ongoing work: 
“Alexandria has achieved the three outputs that define a great company: Superior Results, Distinctive Impact, and 
Lasting Endurance. Alexandria’s success flows from disciplined focus on what it can be the best in the world at, disciplined 
insight into what drives its economic engine, and disciplined people passionate about the company’s purpose. As with 
any great company, this impressive run happened not in one step, but as a cumulative effort—decision by decision, city 
by city, location by location, cluster by cluster—like turning a giant heavy flywheel. Throughout, Alexandria has built 
a leadership culture infused with the personal humility to continually learn, combined with the professional will to do 
whatever it takes to enhance the success of its customers, and, through them, change the world through innovation.”
The truly cumulative process that Alexandria underwent to become a great company, one intrinsically tied to the 
successes of the innovators we serve, was borne out of the financial crisis of 2008−2009. Coinciding with our shift to 
our cluster campus strategy, we made it impressively through the tumultuous period by preserving our most valuable 
asset—our people—without resorting to layoffs. As a result, we have built an incredibly strong, diverse, and long-tenured 
leadership team at all levels of the company. 
Today, with the strongest balance sheet in company history, along with our incredible pace of early lease renewals and 
reliable, long-term demand for space from highly innovative entities, Alexandria is currently experiencing a period of 
historic internal and external growth. 
INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS DRIVE STRONG DEMAND AND OUR BOLD, STRATEGIC FIVE-YEAR GROWTH PLAN 
The life science industry is currently undergoing a knowledge explosion, which, supported by ample capital and innovation 
at every stage of development, has resulted in a potential capacity to treat and even cure diseases at an unprecedented 
rate. Multiple positive factors continue to drive the industry forward, including strong bipartisan support for biomedical 
research leading to continued robust National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, significant partnering and M&A 
activity as large biopharma companies grow their pipelines through external innovation, and a favorable regulatory 
environment that encourages R&D and is helping truly novel therapies reach patients. With only 500 of the 10,000 
diseases known to humankind currently addressable through medical therapies, the biology revolution has just begun. 
Within the technology sector, advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data have led to a war 
for talent among companies looking to employ such tools to solve large problems, including in healthcare, data privacy, 
and cybersecurity. Such innovation fuels demand for our cutting-edge, highly amenitized spaces to attract and retain top 
talent. The need for greenhouse and laboratory space is also increasing as the agtech industry shifts to tackle the challenge 
of feeding a global population expected to grow to roughly 8.5 billion people by 2030 from about 7.5 billion people today.
Alexandria is extremely well positioned to take advantage of these positive fundamentals and to execute our 
multifaceted business strategy. At our annual Investor Day on November 28, 2018, we presented our bold and positive 
framework for our five-year growth plan to double rental revenues by 2022, compared to 2017, with our existing  
value-creation pipeline of development and redevelopment properties and continued execution of strong internal growth.
 
LOOKING AHEAD WITH CONFIDENCE
In 2019, as we celebrate Alexandria’s 25th anniversary, we look forward to reaping the benefits of the continued strong macro 
real estate and life science fundamentals driving strong demand for our collaborative campuses in our leading innovation 
clusters throughout the country. Accordingly, we have been mobilizing our visionary cluster campus strategy to support the 
rapidly growing agtech industry. The need for innovation across the agricultural supply chain has never been greater, and we 
are committed to driving the evolution of the agricultural ecosystem to improve nutrition and expand access to food, just as 
we have supported the life science and technology industries, with our proven and differentiated business model.
We also continue to make meaningful investments toward cultivating a unique culture of excellence defined by our sense 
of purpose and opportunities to grow, collaborate, and be inspired. We remain as passionate as ever about making a positive 
and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our tenants, stockholders, employees, and the communities 
in which we live and work, and we will continue to be motivated by seeing the long-term positive effect of such work. 
Our company demonstrates that accomplishing meaningful endeavors can drive extraordinary growth. By staying true 
to our strategic focus, I am confident we can continue to generate industry-leading returns and substantially outperform 
over the long term.
With sincere gratitude,
JOEL S. MARCUS

A Q& A WITH  
ALEXANDRIA’S  
CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICERS
QWhere were you in your careers prior to Alexandria, and how have your career 
trajectories led you to serve as Alexandria’s Co-CEOs today?
A PETER: Before I joined Alexandria, I was a financial analyst and at a point in my career where I 
was starting to negotiate acquisitions and put together joint ventures on my own. At that 
time, Alexandria was looking for somebody who could develop their earnings model and underwrite 
their acquisitions. I knew how to do both, so they hired me to join 15–20 other employees. That was 
in 1998. I was kind of a jack-of-all trades, and like most employees with the company back then, I 
wore a lot of hats. We’re still that way. The Alexandria culture has always been one where everyone 
makes the deals and the coffee. 
I also did a lot of work helping to build our clusters, which I’m proud of. 
Alexandria opened up a number of offices over the years, and in 2003, there 
was an opportunity (through a key acquisition we had made) to open one in 
Seattle. I took that role on, and it gave me a great background in operations and 
asset management I hadn’t had before. Up to that point, I had always been on 
the finance side. With Seattle, I was the manager.
And then in 2009, Alexandria created a chief investment officer role, which 
I was appointed to. I think the key to my success as CIO is that our regional 
leaders trust me. They trust me to help them think through their ideas and to 
ensure their ideas line up with our company goals. 
Eventually, when it came time to name the next CEO, or Co-CEOs as we 
would come to have, I believe I was a great candidate because of my experience 
and track record at the company, and all the areas of the business I’d had a hand 
in, and the trust and respect I earned from my peers. 
STEVE: I initially started in the Silicon Valley as a broker and then moved over to 
a real estate development company. From two years of doing that, it seemed like

lobby design, and that just was not intellectually or professionally very rewarding.

So I went in a completely different direction toward the technology realm, which    
PETER M. MOGLIA  
included traveling to Russia during the Perestroika and Glasnost era to try to

put partnerships together between Silicon Valley tech companies and Russian  CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
companies. (And, no, I did not sell condos to any Russian oligarchs during that time.) 
Then, after the tech company where I was working got acquired, I connected with Alexandria. 
Alexandria was working with the real estate on a much more technical and complex level, and it looked 
like a more intellectually and professionally rewarding way to work. On top of that, what Alexandria’s 
life science tenants were doing inside the buildings was very inspiring. Alexandria’s business model is 
unique. I found it very appealing, and it made me excited to lead the San Francisco region. 
Then, similar to Peter—I think it was around the same time he was appointed to CIO, or shortly

after—Alexandria appointed me to help support the executive team in the chief  FAST FACTS ABOUT

words that resonate for me. Take initiative. Be a leader. Be entrepreneurial.  
We want to be a very agile company as we continue to grow, so work with 
purpose, work with intention. Be passionate about what you’re doing, and really pursue that and  
seek that.
I think that our company’s DNA is what makes a big difference for us. Each and every Alexandria 
team member is united in passion and purpose. We continually strive to create an inclusive 
environment that values all people and their talents and contributions. 
PETER: Yes, one of the key pieces of our DNA is that we’re people oriented. We hire only the best people. 
We never settle just to fill positions. We’re very meticulous and selective about who we bring on.
A big part of our DNA is that we are a team. We’re one company, one team. There are no empire 
builders here. You have to be a team player; you have to root for other people’s success. 
For example, you can’t have a co-management structure like we have at Alexandria without a lot 
of mutual respect and support. If we were all out for ourselves, we’d have a house of cards that would 
easily fall. I really think that the key to our culture and our DNA is the fact that everybody here is 
working toward accomplishing our goals. And it’s we, not me.

and shortly after, I was born. My mom was an emergency room nurse. My dad 
drove an ambulance. They were grace under pressure personified. And they 
were very determined to build a good life. That’s the type of mindset and drive that we want our 
Alexandria team to be cultivating. We want them to be determined to build a great company together 
and a good life for their families.
I believe that you lead by being supportive and encouraging. You do that by having good 
attention to detail and by modeling behavior. Being able to remain calm and determined is really 
a critically important skill, especially in leadership. You can have a very adverse impact on your 
organization if you can’t stay even-keeled. You have to be clear, you have to hold firm. You can be as 
determined as anybody that your people have better outcomes, but you absolutely have to stay very 
calm in the middle of chaotic, challenging situations. Like the driver of an ambulance. Or a nurse  
in an emergency room.
QWhat does being part of the Alexandria family mean to you?
A STEVE: What I find really pretty special is the tenure people have in working with one another 
at Alexandria. A lot of people today move around from company to company and therefore 
only build transitory relationships. 
Having people you’ve worked with, gone through tough times with, celebrated victories with, and to 
have done that now for two decades with these people, that’s pretty unique. Our long-term experience 
working together has resulted in a socially and professionally fun culture. It’s gratifying. That dimension 
of the Alexandria culture is really special and something we’re all grateful for, I’m grateful for.
PETER: Yes. I’d add that I think we all work very hard and spend so much time together that you 
almost can’t help but become a family. We kind of have (given that we’ve been together for so long)

STEVE: “We Will Rock You” by Queen
A STEVE: I think a lot of our success and our greatest opportunities are due  PETER: “Neon Moon” by Brooks and 
to the life science industry we serve and partner with. We’ve said this  Dunn (I did it a couple of months 
ago and got a round of applause)
before and often, because it’s true: we’re at the very beginnings of a renaissance 
in biology, the next frontier of an industry we’re privileged to serve, one that  THREE ITEMS TO TAKE WITH  
YOU ON A DESERTED ISLAND 
can advance human health.
STEVE: Sunscreen, a hat, and beer
If we were serving an aging industry or a maturing or a dying industry, our  PETER: My wife, a stereo, and red wine
prospects would be very different. Fortunately, at Alexandria we’re working 
WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE  
with an industry that’s still just beginning to innovate. When you combine that  WHEN YOU GREW UP 
with the depth and breadth of the talent at our company, the next 25 years  STEVE: Pitcher for the NY Yankees
PETER: I was asked that question 
should be even more exciting and more inspiring than the last 25 years. With  when I was 3 or 4 and said dinosaur, 
the latest breakthroughs in scientific technology related to human health,  so I’m sticking with it.
Alexandria’s future could be unbelievable. 
Intellectually, it’s extremely exciting, and that’s where I think the success 
of the company is going to come from: taking the people we have, who enjoy a challenge and seek a 
larger purpose, and applying their talent to this amazing industry.
PETER: Specifically, I think Steve and I need to foster teamwork and collaboration by being player-
coaches. We have an amazing management team and amazing people who execute day in and day out 
to lease buildings, to acquire properties, to invest in ventures, to raise capital. We have a lot of varied 
expertise in the company to excel in these activities, and we need to continue to make the whole 
greater than the sum of its parts. We can do that by maximizing collaboration and teamwork. When 
we assemble all of that talent together, that’s when one plus one can, in effect, equal three. 
Where I see the greatest opportunities for growth, I’ll echo what Steve said as far as the amount 
of research that needs to be done to advance human health, especially by curing disease: that’s to say, 
at this point, it’s infinite. We’re at the beginnings of the biology revolution; we’re not near the end. 
We’re in the very early innings of solving things. There are 10,000 diseases for which there are only 
about 500 known treatments. Only in the past decade have we really seen green shoots of the biology 
revolution come out of the ground. There’s a lot more work to do, extending well beyond Steve’s and 
my tenure at Alexandria, and possibly our lifetimes. 
With the emerging importance of the intersection of science and technology today, there are great 
opportunities for Alexandria to serve both industries well into the future. They’ll continue to work to 
solve the issues that impact us today and in the next generations, and we’ll continue to stand shoulder 
to shoulder with them.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a Maryland corporation, formed in October 1994, that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax 
purposes. We are an S&P 500® company and an urban office REIT uniquely focused on collaborative life science and technology 
campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. We consider AAA locations to be highly desirable for tenancy by life science and 
technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related 
businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and 
a limited supply of available space. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market 
presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research 
Triangle Park.
Alexandria develops dynamic urban cluster campuses and vibrant ecosystems that enable and inspire the world’s most 
brilliant minds and innovative companies to create life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs. We believe in the utmost 
professionalism, humility, and teamwork. Alexandria manages its properties through fully integrated regional teams with real estate, 
life science, and technology expertise. Our tenants include multinational pharmaceutical companies; public and private biotechnology 
companies; life science product, service, and medical device companies; digital health, and technology companies; academic and 
medical research institutions; U.S. government research agencies; non-profit companies; and venture capital firms. Alexandria has a 
longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science and technology campuses that 
provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit 
and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Alexandria also provides strategic risk capital 
to transformative life science and technology companies through its venture capital arm. We believe our unique business model and 
diligent underwriting ensure a high-quality and diverse tenant base that should result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, 
higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. 
As of December 31, 2018, Alexandria’s total market capitalization was $18.4 billion and our asset base in North America 
consisted of 33.1 million SF. The asset base in North America includes 22.4 million RSF of operating properties and 3.9 million RSF 
of development and redevelopment of new Class A properties currently undergoing construction and pre-construction activities with 
target delivery dates ranging from 2019 through 2020. Additionally, the asset base in North America includes 6.8 million SF of 
intermediate-term and future development projects. These operating properties and development projects include 11 properties that are 
held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and six properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The 
occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 97.3% as of December 31, 2018. Our 10-year average 
occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31, 2018, was 96%. Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants 
represented 52% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2018. Additional information regarding our consolidated 
and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is

included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Business objective and strategies
Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and shareholder returns based on a multifaceted 
platform of internal and external growth. A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A properties clustered in urban 
campuses located in AAA innovation cluster locations. These key urban campus locations are characterized by high barriers to 
entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. They represent highly desirable 
locations for tenancy by life science and technology entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, 
knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad real estate, life 
science, and technology relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading tenants and to source additional value-
creation real estate.
Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science and technology industries and reflects our focus on regional, 
national, and international tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a more detailed description of our 
properties and tenants, refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have an experienced Board of 
Directors and are led by an executive and senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate, life science, and 
technology industries.
Acquisitions
We seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our target cluster markets. Critical evaluation of prospective 
property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a 
full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:
•  Proximity to centers of innovation and technological advances;
•  Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;
•  Quality of existing and prospective tenants;
•  Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;
•  Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;
•  Quality and generic characteristics of the improvements;
•  Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space;
•  Availability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities;
•  Availability of land for future ground-up development of new space;
•  Opportunities to generate higher rent through redevelopment of existing space;
•  The property’s unlevered yields; and
•  Our ability to increase the property’s long-term financial returns.
Development, pre-construction, and redevelopment
A key component of our business model is our value-creation development projects. Our development strategy is 
primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing for which we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns 
and generally match a source of funds for this use. Our value-creation development projects focus on high-quality, generic, and 
reusable office/laboratory or tech office space to meet the real estate requirements of our diverse group of tenants.
We seek to meet growing demand from our stakeholders and continuously improve the efficiency of our buildings. We 
have committed to significant building goals to promote wellness and productivity for our buildings’ occupants, including targeting 
a minimum of LEED® Gold certification on all new ground-up construction projects. 
Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding 
commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements, which are focused on reducing the time required to deliver 
projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value to our future ground-up development and are required 
for the vertical construction of buildings. We normally do not commence vertical construction of new projects prior to achieving 
significant pre-leasing. 
2
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  2
Another key component of our business model is our value-creation redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell 
space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable space that can be leased at higher rental rates. Our 
redevelopment strategy generally includes significant pre-leasing of projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment. 
Non-real estate investments 
  We also hold equity investments in publicly traded companies, limited partnerships, and privately held entities primarily 
involved in the life science and technology industries. We invest in highly innovative entities whose focus on the development of 
therapeutic products that advance health and transform patients’ lives is aligned with Alexandria’s purpose of making a positive 
and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of the global community. Our status as a REIT limits our ability to 
make such non-real estate investments. Therefore, we conduct, and will continue to conduct, our non-real estate investment 
activities in a manner that complies with REIT requirements. 
Balance sheet and financial strategy
We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our 
stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of office/
laboratory and tech office space, as well as the management of our balance sheet. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet 
liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders by:
•  Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital, including operating cash flows after dividends, incremental debt, 
asset sales, and other capital such as the sale of equity or joint venture capital;
•  Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit, available 
commitments under secured construction loans, marketable securities, and cash and cash equivalents;
•  Continuing to improve our credit profile;
•  Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;
•  Maintaining commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•  Maintaining low to modest leverage;
•  Minimizing variable interest rate risk;
•  Generating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows;
•  Selectively selling real estate assets, including land parcels and non-core/“core-like” operating assets, and reinvesting 
the proceeds into our highly leased value-creation development projects;
•  Allocating capital to Class A properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban 
innovation clusters;
•  Maintaining geographic diversity in urban intellectual centers of innovation;
•  Selectively acquiring high-quality office/laboratory and tech office space in our target urban innovation cluster 
submarkets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns;
•  Selectively developing properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets;
•  Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, 
generic, and reusable space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets;
•  Renewing existing tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible;
•  Minimizing tenant improvement costs;
•  Improving investment returns through the leasing of vacant space and the replacing of existing tenants with new 
tenants at higher rental rates;
•  Executing leases with high-quality tenants and proactively monitoring tenant health;
•  Maintaining solid occupancy while attaining high rental rates;
•  Realizing contractual rental rate escalations; and
•  Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for 
operating expenses and certain capital expenditures.

Competition
In general, other office/laboratory and tech office properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount 
of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rental rates we can 
attain for our properties. In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and 
investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, owners/occupants, and foreign investors. 
Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or 
accept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a 
tenant or the overall expected returns from real estate investments. In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our 
competitors may offer more free rent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances in order to attract 
tenants. These leasing incentives could hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants. Competition may 
also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property 
owners seeking to sell. Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other 
REITs, has been very strong over the past several years; however, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our 
competitors. As the first and only publicly traded urban office REIT to focus primarily on the office/laboratory real estate niche, we 
provide world-class collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations and maintain and 
cultivate many of the most important and strategic relationships in the life science and technology industries.

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that 
such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to 
permit access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We 
believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital 
expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of 
fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, 
and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental matters
Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for 
contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to 
investigate and clean up contamination located on or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard 
to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint 
and several. Previous owners may have used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may 
contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our 
properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real 
estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-
containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or 
operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or 
operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  4
In addition, some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their routine operations at our 
properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. 
Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with 
these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities. 
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the 
properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental 
condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface 
investigations, or an asbestos survey. To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we 
believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that the 
assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that may have 
arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may also impose 
additional material environmental liabilities.
Insurance
With respect to our properties, we carry commercial general liability, all-risk property, and business interruption 
insurance, including loss of rental income coverage. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be 
appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage, and industry practice. In our opinion, the properties in our 
portfolio are currently adequately insured. In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the 
vicinity of known active earthquake zones in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. We also 
carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies on our properties. We generally obtain our title insurance policies when 
we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any 
of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. Additional information 
regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
Forward-looking statements 
The following risk factors may adversely affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash 
flows; our ability to make distributions to our stockholders; our access to capital; or the market price of our common stock, as further 
described in each risk factor below. In addition to the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, one should carefully 
review and consider the information contained in our other reports and periodic filings that we make with the SEC. Those risk factors 
could materially affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; our ability to make distributions 
to our stockholders; our access to capital; or the market price of our common stock. The risks that we describe in our public filings are 
not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, 
also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Operating factors
We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties. 
We continually evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire properties when opportunities exist. Our ability 
to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to the following significant risks:
•  We may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant 
capital, including both publicly traded REITs and institutional funds;
•  Even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase 
the purchase price or result in other less favorable terms;
•  Even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions 
to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction;
•  We may be unable to complete an acquisition because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms 
or at all;
•  We may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;
•  We may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of operating properties 
or portfolios of properties, into our existing operations;
•  Acquired properties may be subject to reassessment, which may result in higher-than-expected property tax payments;
•  Market conditions may result in higher-than-expected vacancy rates and lower-than-expected rental rates; and
•  We may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to 
unknown liabilities, such as liabilities for the cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination; claims by tenants, 
vendors, or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; and claims for indemnification by general 
partners, directors, officers, and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial 
expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the 
market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
We may suffer economic harm as a result of making unsuccessful acquisitions in new markets.
We may pursue selective acquisitions of properties in markets where we have not previously owned properties. These 
acquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we face in other acquisitions where we are familiar with the markets, such as the risk 
of not correctly anticipating conditions or trends in a new market and therefore not being able to generate profit from the acquired 
property. If this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to make distributions 
to our stockholders, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and the market price of our common stock.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  6
The acquisition of new properties or the development of new properties may give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue 
potential.
We may continue to acquire additional properties and/or land and may seek to develop our existing land holdings 
strategically as warranted by market conditions. These acquisitions and developments could fail to perform in accordance with 
expectations. If we fail to accurately estimate occupancy levels, rental rates, lease commencement dates, operating costs, or costs of 
improvements to bring an acquired property or a development property up to the standards established for our intended market 
position, the performance of the property may be below expectations. Acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies 
affecting their valuation or revenue potential that we have not yet discovered. We cannot assure our stockholders that the performance 
of properties acquired or developed by us will increase or be maintained under our management.
We may fail to obtain the financial results expected from development or redevelopment projects.
There are significant risks associated with development and redevelopment projects, including the possibility that:
•  We may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•  We may be unable to lease development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts;
•  We may encounter project delays or cancellations due to unavailability of necessary labor and construction materials;
•  We may expend funds on, and devote management’s time to, development and redevelopment projects that we may not 
complete;
•  We may abandon development or redevelopment projects after we begin to explore them, and as a result, we may lose 
deposits or fail to recover costs already incurred;
•  Market and economic conditions may deteriorate, which can result in lower-than-expected rental rates;
•  We may face higher operating costs than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, including insurance 
premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or increases in 
tariffs;
•  We may face higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development or redevelopment 
projects, particularly in older structures;
•  We may be unable to proceed with development or redevelopment projects because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity 
financing on favorable terms or at all;
•  We may fail to retain tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects if we do not complete the 
construction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants’ specifications;
•  Tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, 
which may adversely affect the income produced by, and the value of, our properties or require us to change the scope of 
the project, which may potentially result in higher construction costs and lower financial returns;
•  We may encounter delays, refusals, unforeseen cost increases, and other impairments resulting from third-party litigation 
or severe weather conditions;
•  We may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required 
government permits and authorizations; and
•  Development or redevelopment projects may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes, 
including latent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service.
  The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial 
expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the 
market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
We could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future development.
If we default under the terms of a ground lease obligation, we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the 
lease. Upon expiration of a ground lease and all of its options, we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms, if at 
all. The loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase in rental expense could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and pay distributions to 
our stockholders, as well as the market price of our common stock. Refer to “Ground Lease Obligations” in the “Sources and Uses of 
Capital” section under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this 
annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on our ground lease obligations.

We may not be able to operate properties successfully and profitably.
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to operate our properties successfully. If we are unable to do so, our 
business could be adversely affected. The ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our 
business and our ability to make payments to our stockholders, including the risks that:
•  Our properties may not perform as we expect;
•  We may have to lease space at rates below our expectations;
•  We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms; and
•  We may underestimate the cost of improvements required to maintain or improve space to meet standards established for 
the market position intended for that property.
The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial 
expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the 
market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
  We may not be able to attain the expected return on our investments in real estate joint ventures. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had several consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we shared 
ownership and decision-making power with one or more parties. Our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint 
venture to take specific major actions, including budget approvals, acquisitions, sales of assets, debt financing, execution of lease 
agreements, and vendor approvals. Under these joint venture arrangements, any disagreements between us and our partners may result 
in delayed decisions. Our inability to take unilateral actions that we believe are in our best interests may result in missed opportunities 
and an ineffective allocation of resources and could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the joint venture and our 
operating results.
We may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those 
costs through to our tenants.
Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses, including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative 
costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. As of December 31, 2018, 
approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate and 
other rent-related taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in 
addition to base rent. 
  Our operating expenses may increase as a result of tax reassessments that our properties are subject to on a regular basis (e.g., 
annually, triennially, etc.), which normally result in increases in property taxes over time as property values increase. In California, 
however, pursuant to the existing state law commonly referred to as Proposition 13, properties are reassessed to market value only at 
the time of change in ownership or completion of construction, and thereafter, annual property reassessments are limited to 2% of 
previously assessed values. As a result, Proposition 13 generally results in significant below-market assessed values over time. From 
time to time, including recently, lawmakers and political coalitions have initiated efforts to repeal or amend Proposition 13 to 
eliminate its application to commercial and industrial properties. If successful, a repeal of Proposition 13 could substantially increase 
the assessed values and property taxes for some of our properties in California. 
  In addition, in June 2018, San Francisco voters approved a commercial rent tax measure, which establishes a new 3.5% gross 
receipts tax rate on rental revenues received by landlords of commercial properties within the city of San Francisco effective January 
1, 2019. Following the election, business organizations challenged this measure in the California Superior Court in San Francisco, 
asserting that the new tax, which passed by a simple majority, required a two thirds majority to pass under state law. This dispute had 
not been resolved as of the scheduled effective date of the new 3.5% gross receipts tax, and the measure went into effect on January 1, 
2019. The new gross receipts tax results in an incremental tax liability imposed on our commercial properties in the city of San 
Francisco, specifically in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco. Unless the court rules in favor of the plaintiff (the 
dispute was still ongoing as of the date of this report), we expect an increase in the range from $3.7 million to $4.6 million in our 
rental operating expenses associated with the operations of our commercial properties in the City of San Francisco. Approximately 
90% of the incremental tax expense is expected to be recoverable from our tenants and will be included in our rental revenues.
  Our triple net leases allow us to pass through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our 
tenants in the form of additional rent. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to negotiate pass-through provisions 
8
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  8
related to taxes in tenant leases in the future, which could lead to a decrease in our tenant recovery revenue. If our operating expenses 
increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. In addition, we cannot be certain that 
increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space outside of the city of San Francisco and the state of 
California, which could significantly hinder our ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. A repeal of 
Proposition 13 in California and a new 3.5% gross receipts tax rate in the city of San Francisco may significantly increase occupancy 
costs for some of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, ability to make rental payments and ability to renew 
lease agreements, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and our ability to 
make distributions to our stockholders.
The cost of maintaining the quality of our properties may be higher than anticipated, which can result in reduced cash 
flows and profitability.
If our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective tenants in terms of rent, services, condition, or location as 
properties owned by our competitors, we could lose tenants or suffer lower rental rates. As a result, we may, from time to time, be 
required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our properties. However, there can be no 
assurances that any such expenditures would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter existing tenants from relocating 
to properties owned by our competitors.
Our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business.
Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our 
tenants experience a downturn in their business or other types of financial distress, they may be unable to make timely payments under 
their leases. Also, if our tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if 
tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, 
concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could generate less cash 
flows from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flows 
generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected 
properties.
The inability of a tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.
Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our 
tenants, especially significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flows, and ability 
to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Additionally, the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget 
for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete U.S. government shutdowns may result in financial difficulties for tenants that 
are dependent on federal funding, which could adversely affect the ability of those tenants to pay us rent.
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our 
tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its 
bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for 
uncollectible future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually 
owed to us under the tenant’s lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders.
We could be held liable for damages resulting from our tenants’ use of hazardous materials.
Many of our tenants engage in research and development activities that involve controlled use of hazardous materials, 
chemicals, and biological and radioactive compounds. In the event of contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous 
materials, we could be held liable for damages that result. This liability could exceed our resources and any recovery available through 
any applicable insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, 
manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Failure to comply with these laws and 
regulations, or changes thereto, could adversely affect our business or our tenants’ businesses and their ability to make rental payments 
to us.

Our properties may have defects that are unknown to us.
Although we thoroughly review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and as they are developed 
and redeveloped, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the 
property’s value or revenue potential.
Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability 
for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture 
problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor 
air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other 
biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels may 
cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant 
mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or 
remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of 
significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, and others if 
property damage or health concerns arise.
We may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.
Our ability to acquire, develop, or redevelop properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital. The real estate industry has 
historically experienced periods of volatile debt and equity capital markets and/or periods of extreme illiquidity. A prolonged period in 
which we cannot effectively access the public debt or equity markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to 
undertake new investments. An inability to obtain debt or equity capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, 
financing, and completing desirable investments and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Also, the issuance of additional 
shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership of our then-existing 
stockholders. Even as liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital may be more expensive than in prior years.
We may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise money.
Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid compared to other investments. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our 
properties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), limits our ability to sell properties held for less than two years. 
These limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to repay debt, and our ability to 
make distributions to our stockholders.
Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing ability.
Our credit ratings may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In the event that our current credit ratings are 
downgraded or removed, we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional 
financing, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and 
liquidity.
We may not be able to refinance our debt, and/or our debt may not be assumable.
Due to the high volume of real estate debt financing in recent years, the real estate industry may require more funds to 
refinance debt maturities than are available from lenders. This potential shortage of available funds from lenders and stricter credit 
underwriting guidelines may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it matures or may adversely affect our financial condition, results 
of operations, cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and the market price of our common stock.
10
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  10
We may not be able to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds, under our unsecured senior 
line of credit, or through unsecured senior bank term loans.
There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to access the unsecured bond market on favorable terms. Our ability to 
borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds may be negatively impacted by periods of illiquidity in the bond 
market. 
Aggregate borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan require compliance with 
certain financial and non-financial covenants. Borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term 
loan are funded by a group of banks. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured 
senior bank term loan may be negatively impacted by a decrease in cash flows from our properties, a default or cross-default under our 
unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan, non-compliance with one or more loan covenants, and non-
performance or failure of one or more lenders under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan. In 
addition, we may not be able to refinance or repay outstanding borrowings on our unsecured senior line of credit or unsecured senior 
bank term loan.
Our inability to borrow additional amounts on an unsecured basis could delay us in or prevent us from acquiring, financing, 
and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our inability to refinance or repay amounts 
under our unsecured senior line of credit or unsecured senior bank term loan may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders, financial condition, and results of operations.
If interest rates rise, our debt service costs will increase and the value of our properties may decrease.
Our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and certain other borrowings bear interest at variable 
rates, and we may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest 
expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt. 
Additionally, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in the market 
price of our common stock. Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders.
Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.
The interest rate hedge agreements we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risks, such as the 
risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be 
effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. These risk factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against 
changes in interest rates and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan restrict our ability to engage in some business 
activities.
Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan contain customary negative covenants and other 
financial and operating covenants that, among other things:
•  Restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;
•  Restrict our ability to make certain investments;
•  Restrict our ability to merge with another company;
•  Restrict our ability to make distributions to our stockholders;
•  Require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and
•  Require us to maintain a pool of qualified unencumbered assets.
Complying with these restrictions may prevent us from engaging in certain profitable activities and constrain our ability to 
effectively allocate capital. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in our defaulting on these and other loans, which 
would likely have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
11
11  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.
We use debt to finance our operations, including the acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties. Our use of 
debt may have adverse consequences, including the following:
•  Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;
•  We may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on 
our debt;
•  If we default on our debt obligations, the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure those loans;
•  A foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the 
tax;
•  A default under a loan that has cross-default provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan or interest 
rate hedge agreement;
•  We may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt;
•  The terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt;
•  We may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured 
senior bank term loan, and certain other borrowings, which could adversely impact our cash flows and operations; and
•  The terms of our debt obligations may require a reduction in our distributions to stockholders.
If our revenues are less than our expenses, we may have to borrow additional funds, and we may not be able to make 
distributions to our stockholders.
If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses, including our debt service obligations 
and capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs. This could adversely 
affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Factors that could adversely affect the revenues we generate from, and the 
values of, our properties include:
•  National, local, and worldwide economic conditions;
•  Competition from other properties;
•  Changes in the life science and technology industries;
•  Real estate conditions in our target markets;
•  Our ability to collect rent payments;
•  The availability of financing;
•  Changes to the financial and banking industries;
•  Changes in interest rate levels;
•  Vacancies at our properties and our ability to re-lease space;
•  Changes in tax or other regulatory laws;
•  The costs of compliance with government regulation;
•  The lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and
•  Increases in operating costs.
In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater exposure to increases in expenses associated 
with operating that property. Certain significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance, and 
maintenance costs, are generally fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.
If we fail to effectively manage our debt obligations, we could become highly leveraged, and our debt service obligations 
could increase to unsustainable levels.
Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Therefore, if we fail to prudently manage 
our capital structure, we could become highly leveraged. This would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could 
adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Higher leverage could also increase the risk 
of default on our debt obligations or may result in downgrades to our credit ratings.
12
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  12
Market volatility may negatively affect our business. 
From time to time, the capital and credit markets experience volatility. In some cases, the markets have produced downward 
pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial and/or operating 
strength. If market disruption and volatility occur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may 
be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Market disruption and volatility may adversely affect the 
value of the companies in which we hold equity investments, and we may be required to recognize losses in our earnings. Disruptions, 
uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our access to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or 
altogether, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond our 
control through extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and financial systems or through other events.
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance would likely adversely affect the market price and 
volatility of our stock.
Our expected financial results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. This may 
be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to:
•  The status of the economy;
•  The status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital;
•  Changes in financing terms available to us;
•  Negative developments in the operating results or financial condition of tenants, including, but not limited to, their 
ability to pay rent;
•  Our ability to re-lease space at similar rates as vacancies occur;
•  Our ability to reinvest sale proceeds in a timely manner at rates similar to the rate at which assets are sold;
•  Regulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and technologies of tenants;
•  Liability or contract claims by or against tenants;
•  Unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions;
•  Environmental laws affecting our properties;
•  Changes in rules or practices governing our financial reporting; and
•  Other legal and operational matters, including REIT qualification and key management personnel recruitment and 
retention.
Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to earnings estimates, funds from operations per share, 
operating cash flows, and revenues, would likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our common 
stock or other outstanding securities.
The price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.
The market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including, but not 
limited to:
•  The availability and cost of debt and/or equity capital;
•  The condition of our balance sheet;
•  Actual or anticipated capital requirements;
•  The condition of the financial and banking industries;
•  Actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;
•  The amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;
•  Changes in our net income, funds from operations, or projections;
•  The publication of research reports and articles about us, our tenants, the real estate industry, or the life science and 
technology industries;
•  The general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other debt or equity 
securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies);
•  General stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, that may lead 
prospective stockholders to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;
•  Fluctuations from general market volatility;
•  Changes in our analyst ratings;
•  Changes in our corporate credit rating or credit ratings of our debt or other securities;
13
13  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
•  Changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•  Adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•  Additions, departures, or other announcements regarding our key management personnel;
•  Actions by institutional stockholders;
•  Speculation in the press or investment community;
•  Terrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and 
causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;
•  Government regulatory action and changes in tax laws;
•  Fiscal policies or inaction at the U.S. federal government level which may lead to federal government shutdowns or 
negative impacts on the U.S. economy;
•  The realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K; and
•  General market and economic conditions.
Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of shares of our common 
stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects.
Possible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.
We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock or the market price of our common stock. 
Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including the conversion or redemption of preferred stock), or the perception that such 
sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Refer to “Other Sources” in the “Sources and 
Uses of Capital” subsection of the “Capital Resources” section under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
We have reserved a number of shares of common stock for issuance to our directors, officers, and employees pursuant to our 
Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (sometimes referred to herein as our “equity incentive plan”). We have 
filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive 
plan. In addition, any shares issued under our equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time 
without restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended). Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock subject to restrictions under Rule 144.
The conversion rights of our convertible preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock.
Subject to certain conditions, we may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our 7.00% Series D cumulative 
convertible preferred stock (“Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”) to automatically convert to common stock. Holders of our Series 
D Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares 
to common stock. 
The conversion of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into our common stock would dilute the ownership of our then-
existing common stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital 
through the sale of additional equity securities. Any adjustments that increase the conversion rate of our Series D Convertible 
Preferred Stock would increase its dilutive effect. Furthermore, the conversion rights by the holders of our Series D Convertible 
Preferred Stock might be triggered in situations in which we need to conserve our cash reserves, in which event, our election, under 
certain conditions, to repurchase such Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in lieu of converting it into common stock might adversely 
affect us and our stockholders.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  14
Our distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.
We may not continue our current level of distributions to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future 
distributions based on a number of factors, including:
•  The amount of net cash provided by operating activities available for distribution;
•  Our financial condition and capital requirements;
•  Any decision to reinvest funds rather than to distribute such funds;
•  Our capital expenditures;
•  The annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;
•  Restrictions under Maryland law; and
•  Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
A reduction in distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our stock price.
Distributions on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of both.
As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. Typically, we generate cash 
for distributions through our operations, the disposition of assets, including partial interest sales, or the incurrence of additional debt. 
Our Board of Directors may determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock in cash, in shares of our common stock, or 
in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. For example, we may declare dividends payable in cash or stock at the 
election of each stockholder, subject to a limit on the aggregate cash that could be paid. Any such dividends would be distributed in a 
manner intended to count in full toward the satisfaction of our annual distribution requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid 
deduction. While the IRS privately has ruled that such a dividend would so qualify if certain requirements are met, no assurances can 
be provided that the IRS would not assert a contrary position in the future. Moreover, a reduction in the cash yield on our common 
stock may negatively impact our stock price.
We have certain ownership interests outside the U.S. that may subject us to risks different from or greater than those 
associated with our domestic operations.
We have three operating properties in Canada and one operating property in China. Acquisition, development, 
redevelopment, ownership, and operating activities outside the U.S. involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to 
our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to:
•  Adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;
•  Challenges and/or taxation with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings or repatriation of proceeds from the sale of 
one or more of our foreign investments;
•  Changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally, and locally;
•  Challenges in managing international operations;
•  Challenges in hiring or retaining key management personnel;
•  Challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, 
corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment, and legal proceedings;
•  Differences in lending practices;
•  Differences in languages, cultures, and time zones; 
•  Changes in applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations;
•  Future partial or complete U.S. federal government shutdowns, trade disagreements with other countries, or uncertainties 
that could affect business transactions within the U.S. and with foreign entities;
•  Changes in tax and local regulations with potentially adverse tax consequences and penalties; and
•  Foreign ownership and transfer restrictions.
In addition, our foreign investments are subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions based on local tax laws and regulations and 
on existing international tax treaties. We have invested in foreign markets under the assumption that our future earnings in each of 
those countries will be taxed at the current prevailing income tax rates. There are no guarantees that foreign governments will continue 
to honor existing tax treaties we have relied upon for our foreign investments or that the current income tax rates in those countries 
will not increase significantly, thus impacting our ability to repatriate our foreign investments and related earnings.
15
15  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with establishing effective controls and 
procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar applicable anti-
corruption laws prohibit individuals and entities from offering, promising, authorizing, or providing payments or anything of value, 
directly or indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain, retain, or direct business. Failure to comply with these laws could 
subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our 
international investments. In addition, if we fail to effectively manage our international operations, our overall financial condition, 
results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
Furthermore, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are 
subject to dispute resolution rules of, another country or region. In some cases, such a country or region might not have a forum that 
provides us an effective or efficient means for resolving disputes that may arise under these agreements.
We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited liability 
companies, and joint ventures.
Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited 
liability companies, or joint ventures. Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments involve certain risks, 
including, but not limited to, the following:
•  Upon bankruptcy of non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint venture entities, we may 
become liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture;
•  We may share certain approval rights over major decisions with third parties;
•  We may be required to contribute additional capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital 
contributions;
•  Our partners, co-members, or joint venture partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are 
inconsistent with our business interests or goals and that could affect our ability to lease or re-lease the property, operate 
the property, or maintain our qualification as a REIT;
•  Our ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of 
our agreements with our partners; and
•  We may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationships or may need to purchase 
such interests or assets at an above-market price to continue ownership.
We generally seek to maintain control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint venture investments in a 
manner sufficient to permit us to achieve our business objectives. However, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or 
more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders, or the market price of our common stock.
Market and other external factors may adversely impact the valuation of our equity investments.
We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies, limited partnerships, and privately held entities primarily 
involved in the life science and technology industries. The valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond 
our control, including, but not limited to, market prices, market conditions, the effect of healthcare reform legislation, prospects for 
favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new products, product 
safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements. In addition, partial or complete future government shutdowns that may 
result in temporary closures of agencies such as the FDA and SEC may adversely affect the processing of initial public offerings, 
business operations, financial results, and funding for projects of the companies in which we hold equity investments. Unfavorable 
developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our equity investments.
Market and other external factors may negatively impact the liquidity of our equity investments.
  We make and hold investments in privately held life science and technology companies. These investments may be illiquid, 
which could impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them. The 
lack of liquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis and may impair the value 
of these investments. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of these investments quickly, we may realize significantly less than 
the amounts at which we had previously valued these investments. 
16
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  16
We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
From time to time, we may have significant cash balances that we invested in a variety of short-term investments that are 
intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. These investments may 
include (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks, money market funds, treasury bank 
securities, and other short-term securities. Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under 
certain circumstances, we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or funds at less than par value. A decline in the 
value of our investments, or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem them, may have a material adverse effect on our results of 
operations or financial condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.
We could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.
We insure our properties with insurance companies we believe have good ratings at the time our policies are put into effect. 
The financial condition of one or more of the insurance companies we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which can 
result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our 
financial results. In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the cost of renewing our insurance policies 
or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.
Our insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses.
If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance, that exceeds our insurance policy limits, or 
that is subject to a policy deductible, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from 
that property. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected 
properties. All properties carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance with respect to our 
properties, including properties partially owned through joint ventures that are managed by our joint venture partners.
We have obtained earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in an 
amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. However, a significant portion of our real estate portfolio is 
located in seismically active regions, such as San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle, and a damaging earthquake in any of these 
regions could significantly impact multiple properties. As a result, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may be 
insufficient to cover our losses, and aggregate deductible amounts may be material, which could adversely affect our business, 
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies for our 
properties. We generally obtain our title insurance policies when we acquire a property, with each policy covering an amount equal to 
the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current 
value of the related property.
Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and casualty insurance that is 
customarily obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses that we and our tenants do not generally insure 
against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them. The availability of coverage against 
certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more limited and, when available, carries a significantly 
higher cost. We cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will remain available for our properties 
because insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against such losses, or such coverage, if offered, may become 
prohibitively expensive. We have not had material losses from terrorism or toxic mold at any of our properties.
The loss of services of any of our senior officers could adversely affect us.
We depend upon the services and contributions of relatively few senior officers. The loss of services or contributions of any 
one of them may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and prospects. We use the extensive personal and business 
relationships that members of our management have developed over time with owners of office/laboratory and tech office properties 
and with major tenants in the life science and technology industries. We cannot assure our stockholders that our senior officers will 
remain employed with us.
17
17  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Competition for skilled personnel could increase labor costs.
We compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. We depend on our 
ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. 
Competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. We may 
not be able to offset such additional costs by increasing the rates we charge tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to 
attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over 
financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control. Changes to our business will 
necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or 
detect misstatement because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of 
controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and 
fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to 
implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition could be materially harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a 
material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
If we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions 
when computing our taxable income.
If, in any taxable year, we failed to qualify as a REIT:
•  We would be subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;
•  We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our stockholders in computing taxable income;
•  We would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost 
qualification, unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code; and
•  We would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make distributions to our stockholders.
As a result of any additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the 
applicable tax. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years 
involved.
Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to 
our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. 
There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we believe that we have operated in a 
manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure our stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified.
From time to time, we dispose of properties in transactions qualified as Section 1031 Exchanges. If a transaction intended to 
qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined by the IRS to be taxable or if we are unable to identify and complete the 
acquisition of a suitable replacement property to effect a Section 1031 Exchange or if the laws surrounding Section 1031 Exchanges 
are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. In such a case, our earnings and profits 
and our taxable income would increase, which could increase the dividend income and reduce the return of capital to our stockholders. 
As a result, we may be required to pay additional dividends to stockholders, or if we do not pay additional dividends, our corporate 
income tax liability could increase and we may be subject to interest and penalties.
  We may not be able to participate in certain sales that the IRS characterizes as “prohibited transactions”. The tax imposed on 
REITs engaging in prohibited transactions is a 100% tax on net income from the transaction. Generally, “prohibited transactions” are 
sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosures, characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary 
course of business. A sale will not be considered a prohibited transaction if it meets certain safe harbor requirements. Otherwise, 
whether or not the transaction is characterized as a prohibited transaction is a factual matter. Although we do not intend to participate 
in prohibited transactions, there is no guarantee that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will 
meet the safe harbor requirements. 
18
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  18
  Federal income tax rules are constantly under review by Congress and the IRS. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect 
our investors or our tenants, and we cannot predict how those changes may affect us in the future. New legislation, U.S. Treasury 
Department regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to 
qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or an investment in our stock. Also, laws relating to the 
tax treatment of investment in other types of business entities could change, making an investment in such other entities more 
attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.
We are dependent on third parties to manage the amenities at our properties. 
We retain third-party managers to manage certain amenities at our properties, such as restaurants, conference centers, 
exercise facilities, and parking garages. Our income from our properties may be adversely affected if these parties fail to provide 
quality services and amenities with respect to our properties. While we monitor the performance of these third parties, we may have 
limited recourse if we believe they are not performing adequately. In addition, these third-party managers may operate, and in some 
cases may own or invest in, properties that compete with our properties, which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, these 
third-party managers may have made, and may in the future make, decisions that are not in our best interests.
We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide utilities and certain other services at our properties, and disruption in 
these services may have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide key services, including, but not limited to, utilities and construction 
services at certain of our properties. Our business and property operations may be adversely affected if key vendors fail to adequately 
provide key services at our properties, as a result of natural disasters (such as fires, floods, earthquakes, etc.), power interruptions, 
bankruptcies, war, acts of terrorism, public health emergencies, cyber-attacks or other unanticipated catastrophic events. If a 
vendor encounters financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that causes it to fail to adequately provide 
utilities, construction, or other important services, we may experience significant interruptions in service and disruptions to business 
operations at our properties, incur remediation costs, and become subject to claims and damages to our reputation.  
In addition, difficulties encountered by key vendors in providing necessary services at our properties could result in a 
significant market rate increases for such services. Our triple net leases allow us to pass through substantially all operating expenses 
and certain capital expenditures to our tenants in the form of additional rent. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to 
continue to negotiate pass-through provisions in tenant leases in the future, which could lead to a decrease in our recovery of operating 
expenses. If our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. In 
addition, we cannot be certain that increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space elsewhere, which 
could significantly hinder our ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. Additionally, this may significantly 
increase occupancy costs for some of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, ability to make rental payments, 
and ability to renew their lease agreements.
On January 29, 2019, in response to potential liabilities arising from a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 
Northern California in 2017 and 2018, PG&E Corporation and its regulated utility subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company 
(together, “PG&E”), initiated voluntary reorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  PG&E is the 
primary public utility company providing electrical and gas service to residential and commercial customers in northern California, 
including the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of our properties located in our San Francisco market depend on PG&E for the delivery 
of these essential services. PG&E has stated that it does not expect any impact to electric or natural gas service for its customers as a 
result of the Chapter 11 proceedings. While bankruptcies of utilities as large and complex as PG&E are relatively infrequent, based on 
the experience in other large utility bankruptcy proceedings (including PG&E’s own previous Chapter 11 proceedings in 2001-2004) 
and the course of Chapter 11 practice generally, we currently consider it highly unlikely that utility service disruptions will occur as a 
result of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. However, in the unexpected event that such service disruptions were to occur at our 
properties in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings and continue for an extended period, they could result in adverse 
consequences to us similar to those described earlier in this risk factor.
The realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial 
expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the 
market price of our common stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.

We may change our business policies without stockholder approval.
Our Board of Directors determines all of our material business policies, with management’s input, including those related to 
our:
•  Status as a REIT;
•  Incurrence of debt and debt management activities;
•  Selective acquisition, disposition, development, and redevelopment activities;
•  Stockholder distributions; and
•  Other policies, as appropriate.
Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders. A change in these 
policies could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
There are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its 
shares and that may delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our stockholders.
In order for a company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% of the value of its 
outstanding stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities (as set forth in the Internal 
Revenue Code) during the last half of a taxable year. Furthermore, shares of our company’s outstanding stock must be beneficially 
owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter 
taxable year. 
In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, our charter provides for an ownership limit, 
which prohibits, with certain exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of stock representing more than 9.8% of the 
combined total value of our outstanding shares of stock by any person, as defined in our charter. Our Board of Directors, in its sole 
discretion, may waive the ownership limit for any person. However, our Board of Directors may not grant such waiver if, after giving 
effect to such waiver, we would be “closely held” under Section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a condition to waiving the 
ownership limit, our Board of Directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel in order to determine our status as 
a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any such ruling or opinion, our Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions 
as it deems appropriate in connection with granting a waiver. 
Our charter further prohibits transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in our being “closely held” under 
Section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code or would result in shares of our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons. 
The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively 
by a group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. A transfer of shares to a person 
who, as a result of the transfer, violates these limits shall be void or these shares shall be exchanged for shares of excess stock and 
transferred to a trust for the benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us. In that case, the intended 
transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the 
trust’s sale of those shares and will effectively forfeit its beneficial ownership of the shares. These ownership limits could delay, defer, 
or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the holders of our common stock or that might 
otherwise be desired by such holders.
In addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that 
may be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.
As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but 
unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock 
without any stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent 
a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that might, for other reasons, be desired by our common 
stockholders, or a series of preferred stock that has a dividend preference that may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our 
common stock.
20
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  20
Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the 
election of directors, and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate directors or to present business 
for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that 
may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common stock or that, for other 
reasons, may be desired by our stockholders.
Market and industry factors
We face substantial competition in our target markets. 
The significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations. We compete for 
investment opportunities with:
•  Other REITs;
•  Insurance companies;
•  Pension and investment funds;
•  Private equity entities;
•  Partnerships;
•  Developers;
•  Investment companies; 
•  Owners/occupants; and
•  Foreign investors, including sovereign wealth funds.
Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or 
accept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a 
tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment 
opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.
Poor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business.
Our properties are primarily located in the following markets:
•  Greater Boston;
•  San Francisco;
•  New York City;
•  San Diego;
•  Seattle;
•  Maryland; and
•  Research Triangle Park.
As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic and real estate conditions in these markets. 
We are, therefore, subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, and other competitive factors specific to 
markets in confined geographic areas. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these 
markets. An economic downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to 
our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science 
and technology industries.

Improvements to our properties are significantly more costly than improvements to traditional office space.
Many of our properties generally contain infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than improvements 
to other property types. Although we have historically been able to recover the additional investment in infrastructure improvements 
through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so in the future. Typical improvements include:
•  Reinforced concrete floors;
•  Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•  Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•  Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•  Enhanced environmental control technology;
•  Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•  Laboratory benches.
We are dependent on the life science and technology industries, and changes within these industries may adversely impact 
our revenues from lease payments and our results of operations.
In general, our business strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life science and technology 
industries. Our business could be adversely affected if the life science and technology industries are impacted by an economic, 
financial, or banking crisis, or if the life science and technology industries migrate from the U.S. to other countries. Because of our 
industry focus, events within these industries may have a more pronounced effect on our results of operations and ability to make 
distributions to our stockholders than if we had more diversified investments. Also, some of our properties may be better suited for a 
particular life science or technology tenant and could require significant modification before we are able to re-lease space to another 
tenant. Generally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on 
renovations.
Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon 
market conditions and the demand for office/laboratory and tech office space at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are 
proposed.
It is common for businesses in the life science and technology industries to undergo mergers or consolidations. Mergers or 
consolidations of life science and technology entities in the future could reduce the RSF requirements of our tenants and prospective 
tenants, which may adversely impact the demand for office/laboratory and tech office space and our future revenue from lease 
payments and our results of operations.
Some of our current or future tenants may include high-tech companies in their startup or growth phases of their life cycle. 
Fluctuations in market confidence vested in these companies or adverse changes in economic conditions may have a disproportionate 
effect on operations of such companies. Deteriorations in the financial conditions of our tenants may result in our inability to collect 
rental payments from them and therefore may negatively impact our results of operations. 
Our results of operations depend on our tenants’ research and development efforts and their ability to obtain funding for 
these efforts.
Our tenant base includes entities in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science, technology, and related 
industries; academic institutions; government institutions; and private foundations. Our tenants base their research and development 
budgets on several factors, including the need to develop new products, the availability of government and other funding, competition, 
and the general availability of resources.
Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, research priorities, general economic 
conditions, institutional and government budgetary limitations, and mergers and consolidations of entities. Our business could be 
adversely impacted by a significant decrease in research and development expenditures by either our tenants or the life science and 
technology industries.
 Our tenants also include research institutions whose funding is largely dependent on grants from government agencies, such 
as the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and similar agencies or organizations. U.S. government funding of research and 
development is subject to the political process, which is often unpredictable. Other programs, such as Homeland Security or defense, 
could be viewed by the government as higher priorities. Additionally, proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have 
22
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  22
sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other U.S. government agencies that fund research and development 
activities. Additionally, the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete 
U.S. federal government shutdowns may result in temporary closures of agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (the 
“FDA”) or National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”), which could adversely affect business operations of our tenants who are 
dependent on government approvals and appropriations. Any shift away from funding of research and development or delays 
surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may adversely impact our tenants’ operations, which in turn may impact 
their demand for office/laboratory and tech office space and their ability to make lease payments to us and thus adversely impact our 
results of operations.
Our life science tenants are subject to a number of risks unique to their industry, including (i) high levels of regulation, 
(ii) failures in the safety and efficacy of their products, (iii) significant funding requirements for product research and 
development, and (iv) changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property protection. These risks may adversely 
affect their ability to make rental payments to us or satisfy their other lease obligations and consequently may materially adversely 
affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
High levels of regulation
•  Some of our tenants develop and manufacture drugs that require regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA, 
prior to being made, marketed, sold, and used. The regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is 
costly, typically takes several years, requires validation through clinical trials and the use of substantial resources, and is 
often unpredictable. A tenant may fail to obtain or may experience significant delays in obtaining these approvals. Even 
if the tenant obtains regulatory approvals, marketed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and potential 
loss of approvals.
•  The ability of some of our tenants to commercialize any future products successfully will depend in part on the coverage 
and reimbursement levels set by government authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers. 
Additionally, reimbursements may decrease in the future.
Failures in the safety and efficacy of their products
•  Some of our tenants developing potential products may find that their products are not effective, or even are harmful, 
when tested in humans.
•  Some of our tenants depend upon the commercial success of certain products. Even if a product made by a tenant is 
successfully developed and proven safe and effective in human clinical trials, and the requisite regulatory approvals are 
obtained, subsequent discovery of safety issues with these products could cause product liability events, additional 
regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, loss of approval, withdrawal of products from the market, 
and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties.
•  A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than a 
competitor’s drug, even if it is successfully developed.
•  The negative results of safety signals arising from the clinical trials of the competitors of our tenants may prompt 
regulatory agencies to take actions that may adversely affect the clinical trials or products of our tenants.
Significant funding requirements for product research and development
•  Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which 
funding must be obtained from venture capital firms; private investors; the public markets; companies in the life science 
industry; or federal, state, and local governments. Such funding may become unavailable or difficult to obtain. The 
ability of each tenant to raise capital will depend on its financial and operating condition, viability of their products, and 
the overall condition of the financial, banking, and economic environment, as well as government budget policies.
•  Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in 
humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies that are commercially useful in the 
discovery or identification of potential drug targets or drugs.
•  Some of our tenants may not be able to successfully manufacture their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven 
through human clinical trials to be safe and effective in humans.
•  Marketed products also face commercialization risk, and tenants may never realize projected levels of product utilization 
or revenues.
•  Negative news regarding the products, the clinical trials, or other business developments of our tenants may cause their 
stock price or credit profile to deteriorate.
23
23  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property protection
•  Our tenants sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, 
frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements, evolving industry standards, and uncertainty over the 
implementation of new healthcare reform legislation, which may cause them to lose competitive positions and adversely 
affect their operations.
•  Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent, copyright, or trade secret protection to develop, make, market, and 
sell their products and technologies. A tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents 
covering such products or technologies are not issued or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or 
circumvented by third parties, or if the tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary to 
commercialize its products or technologies.
•  Many of our tenants depend upon patents to provide exclusive marketing rights for their products. As their product 
patents expire, competitors of these tenants may be able to legally produce and market products similar to those products 
of our tenants, which could have a material adverse effect on their sales and results of operations.
We cannot assure our stockholders that our life science industry tenants will be able to develop, make, market, or sell their 
products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life science industry. Any life science industry tenant that is unable to avoid, 
or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making rental payments to us or satisfying their other lease 
obligations to us. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our life science industry tenants or cause us to expend more funds 
and resources on the space leased by these tenants than we originally anticipated. The increased burden on our resources due to 
adverse developments relating to our life science industry tenants may cause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space 
leased by these tenants. Negative news relating to our more significant life science industry tenants may also adversely impact our 
stock price.
Our technology industry tenants are subject to a number of risks unique to their industry, including (i) an uncertain 
regulatory environment, (ii) rapid technological changes, (iii) a dependency on the maintenance and security of the Internet 
infrastructure, (iv) significant funding requirements for product research and development, and (v) inadequate intellectual 
property protections. These risks may adversely affect their ability to make rental payments to us or satisfy their other lease 
obligations, which in turn may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
Uncertain regulatory environment
•  Laws and regulations governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services are evolving. Existing 
and future laws and regulations and the halting of operations at certain agencies resulting from partial or complete U.S. 
federal government shutdowns may impede the growth of our technology industry tenants. These laws and regulations 
may cover, among other areas, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile 
communications, business licensing, and consumer protection.
Rapid technological changes
•  The technology industry is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements and preferences, frequent new 
product and service introductions, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices. A failure to respond in a 
timely manner to these market conditions could materially impair the operations of our technology industry tenants.
Dependency on the maintenance and security of the Internet infrastructure
•  Some of our tenants depend on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by users of their products and services, as 
well as access to mobile networks. Internet service providers and mobile network operators may be able to block, 
degrade, or charge additional fees to these tenants or users.
•  The Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, outages and other delays. These outages and delays, 
as well as problems caused by cyber attacks and computer malware, viruses, worms, and similar programs, may 
materially affect the ability of our technology industry tenants to conduct business.
•  Security breaches or network attacks may delay or interrupt the services provided by our tenants and could harm their 
reputations or subject them to significant liability.
24
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  24
Significant funding requirements for product research and development
•  Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which 
funding must be obtained from venture capital firms; private investors; the public markets; companies in the technology 
industry; or federal, state, and local governments. Such funding may become unavailable or difficult to obtain. The 
ability of each tenant to raise capital will depend on its financial and operating condition, viability of their products, and 
the overall condition of the financial, banking, governmental budget policies, and economic environment.
•  Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential customers or may not 
be able to create tools or technologies that are commercially useful.
•  Some of our tenants may not be able to successfully manufacture their products economically.
•  Marketed products also face commercialization risk, and some of our tenants may never realize projected levels of 
product utilization or revenues.
•  Unfavorable news regarding the products or other business developments of our tenants may cause their stock price or 
credit profile to deteriorate.
Inadequate intellectual property protections
•  The products and services provided by some of our tenants are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, 
and inadequate intellectual property laws and other inadequate protections could prevent them from enforcing or 
defending their proprietary technologies. These tenants may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content. 
•  Trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress, and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and 
may require our technology industry tenants to incur significant costs to protect their intellectual property rights. 
We cannot assure our stockholders that our technology industry tenants will be able to develop, make, market, or sell their 
products and services due to the risks inherent in the technology industry. Any technology industry tenant that is unable to avoid, or 
sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making rental payments to us or satisfying their other lease 
obligations to us. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our technology industry tenants or cause us to expend more funds 
and resources on the space leased by these tenants than we originally anticipated. The increased burden on our resources due to 
adverse developments relating to our technology industry tenants may cause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space 
leased by these tenants. Unfavorable news relating to our more significant technology industry tenants may also adversely impact our 
stock price.
Government factors
  Negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax policy, debt policy, and 
government spending may adversely affect our results of operations.
Global macroeconomic conditions affect our tenants’ businesses. Instability in the banking and government sectors of the 
U.S. and/or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of government tax policy, debt policy, and 
government spending, may have an adverse effect on the overall economic growth and our future revenue growth and profitability. 
Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions could undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other 
markets and cause our tenants to reduce or defer their spending, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets 
we serve could be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time. Differing economic 
conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographic regions in which we operate and the industries we 
serve may in the future affect demand for our services. Our revenues and profitability are derived from our tenants in North 
America, some of which derive significant revenues from their international operations. Ongoing economic volatility and 
uncertainty affects our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand 
beyond the short term and to effectively build our revenue and spending plans. Economic volatility and uncertainty are particularly 
challenging because it may take some time for the effects and resulting changes in demand patterns to manifest themselves in our 
business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant 
negative impact on our results of operations. These risks may impact our overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price 
of our common stock.

Failure of the U.S. federal government to manage its fiscal matters or to raise or further suspend the debt ceiling, and 
changes in the amount of federal debt, may negatively impact the economic environment and adversely impact our results of 
operations.
The Budget Control Act of 2011 provided for a reduction of $1.1 trillion of U.S. federal government discretionary 
spending over the succeeding decade (later extended through 2023) through a series of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts 
known as sequestration. Sequestration went into effect on March 1, 2013, and will remain in effect in the absence of further 
legislative action.
The U.S. federal government has established a limit on the level of federal debt that the U.S. federal government can have 
outstanding, often referred to as the debt ceiling. The U.S. Congress has authority to raise or suspend the debt ceiling and to 
approve the funding of U.S. federal government operations within the debt ceiling, and has done both frequently in the past, often 
on a relatively short-term basis. Following a three-day partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government in January 2018, the U.S. 
Congress extended the government funding deadline to February 8, 2018. On February 9, 2018, the U.S. President signed the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which temporarily suspended the statutory debt limit through March 1, 2019. Absent an increase in, 
or further suspensions to, the debt ceiling subsequent to March 1, 2019, the U.S. federal government may partially or completely 
shut down and/or default on its existing loans as a result of reaching the debt ceiling. If legislation to increase the debt ceiling is 
not enacted and the debt ceiling is reached, the federal government may stop or delay making payments on its obligations. A failure 
by the U.S. Congress to raise the debt limit to the extent necessary would increase the risk of default by the U.S. on its obligations, 
the risk of a lowering of the credit rating of the U.S. federal government, and the risk of other economic dislocations. If the U.S. 
government fails to complete its budget process, another federal government shutdown may result. Such a failure, or the perceived 
risk of such a failure could consequently have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the 
U.S. and throughout the world.
An inability of the U.S. federal government to manage its fiscal matters, reduce the duration and scope of sequestration, 
or manage its debt may result in the loss of economic confidence domestically and globally, reduce investment spending, increase 
borrowing costs, impact availability and cost of capital, and significantly hinder or reduce economic activity. Furthermore, a failure 
by the U.S. federal government to enact appropriate fiscal legislation may significantly impact the national and global economic 
and financial environment and affect our business and the businesses of our tenants. In December 2018, the U.S. Congress failed to 
enact a budget for the upcoming fiscal year’s government operations and the President rejected a stopgap funding bill to fund the 
government into early 2019, which resulted in a partial government shutdown that began on December 22, 2018. The shutdown 
affected certain key agencies at the federal government level, resulting in partial closures of operations. The shutdown ended on 
January 25, 2019, when the President signed a bill to temporarily reopen the government through February 15, 2019, during which 
further negotiations are expected. If a resolution is not agreed upon, it is possible a second partial government shutdown may 
occur. If economic conditions severely deteriorate as a result of government fiscal gridlock, our tenants’ operations could be 
adversely affected, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These risks may also impact our 
overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock.
Monetary policy actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve could adversely impact our financial condition and our ability to 
make distributions to our stockholders.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has been gradually increasing the target range for the federal funds rate. In December 2017, the 
U.S. Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate to a range from 1.25% to 1.50%. During each quarter of 2018, the U.S. 
Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate by 25 bps per quarter. As of December 31, 2018, the federal funds rate was set at a 
range from 2.25% to 2.50% and the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its intention to continue to raise the federal funds rate over 
time. The continuing increase in targeted federal funds rate will likely result in an increase in market interest rates, which may 
increase our interest expense under our unhedged variable-rate borrowings and the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or 
obtaining new debt. In addition, increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a 
decrease in the market price of our common stock. Increases in market interest rates may also adversely affect the securities 
markets generally, which could reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. Any 
such unfavorable changes to our borrowing costs and stock price could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity 
capital going forward.
26
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  26
Changes to the U.S. tax laws could have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants, and our 
business.
On December 20, 2017, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a tax reform bill, which the U.S. President 
signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Reform Legislation”). Among other things, the Tax Reform Legislation:
•  Restricted the deductibility of interest expense by businesses (generally, to 30% of the business’ adjusted taxable 
income) except, among others, real property businesses electing out of such restriction; generally, we expect our 
business to qualify as a real property business, but businesses conducted by our taxable REIT subsidiaries may not 
qualify; 
•  Required real property businesses to use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property 
in the event businesses elect to avoid the interest deduction restriction above;
•  Restricted the benefits of like-kind exchanges that defer capital gains for tax purposes to exchanges of real property;
•  Required accrual method taxpayers to take certain amounts in income no later than the taxable year in which such 
income is taken into account as revenue in an applicable financial statement prepared under GAAP, which, with 
respect to certain leases, could accelerate the inclusion of rental income; and
•  Generally allowed a deduction for individuals equal to 20% of certain income from pass-through entities, including 
ordinary dividends distributed by a REIT (excluding capital gain dividends and qualified dividend income).
  Many of the provisions in the Tax Reform Legislation expire at the end of 2025. 
  The Tax Reform Legislation was a far-reaching and complex revision to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws with 
disparate and, in some cases, countervailing impacts on different categories of taxpayers and industries and will require subsequent 
rulemaking and interpretation in a number of areas. As a result, the long-term impact of the Tax Reform Legislation on the overall 
economy, government revenues, our tenants, us, and the real estate industry cannot be reliably predicted. Furthermore, the Tax 
Reform Legislation may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results, financial condition, and future business plans. 
The Tax Reform Legislation may also result in reduced government revenues, and therefore reduced government spending, which 
may negatively impact some of our tenants that rely on government funding. There can be no assurance that the Tax Reform 
Legislation will not negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and future business operations.
  Actual and anticipated changes to the regulations of the healthcare system may have a negative impact on the pricing 
of drugs, the cost of healthcare coverage, and the reimbursement of healthcare services and products.
The FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many critical activities of life science, 
technology, and healthcare industries, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising 
and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, and product risk management. In both domestic and foreign markets, 
sales of products depend in part on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and 
private health plans. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement, and pricing of products to control cost or affect 
utilization of products. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and 
reimbursement limitations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third-party payers of newly approved 
healthcare products. The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and 
costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products. In particular, 
there have been recent judicial and Congressional challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as 
amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), which could have an impact on coverage 
and reimbursement for healthcare terms and services covered by plans authorized by the ACA. During 2017 several attempts were 
made to amend the ACA; however, no amendment proposal gained the 50-vote support from the U.S. Senate needed to pass a 
repeal bill. As a result, in October 2017, The U.S. President issued an Executive Order “Promoting Healthcare Choice and 
Competition Across the United States.” We do not know how our tenants will be affected (if at all) by this new executive order. 
Government and other regulatory oversight and future regulatory and government interference with the healthcare systems may 
adversely impact our tenants’ businesses and our business.

U.S. government tenants may not receive anticipated appropriations, which could hinder their ability to pay us.
U.S. government tenants are subject to government funding. If one or more of our U.S. government tenants fail to receive 
anticipated appropriations, we may not be able to collect rental amounts due to us. A significant reduction in federal government 
spending, particularly a sudden decrease due to the recent tax reform or to a sequestration process, which has occurred in recent 
years, could also adversely affect the ability of these tenants to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the likelihood that they will 
renew their leases with us. In addition, recent budgetary pressures have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced 
allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities, such as the National Institutes of Health 
(“NIH”). For example, the NIH budget has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of 
the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became effective on March 1, 2013. Past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included 
reduced NIH and other research and development budgets. Any shift away from the funding of research and development or delays 
surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our tenants to default on rental payments or delay or forgo 
leasing our rental space, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, the 
inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete U.S. federal government 
shutdowns could adversely impact demand for our services by limiting federal funding available to our tenants and their 
customers. In addition, defaults under leases with U.S. government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction 
or rent deficiency laws. As of December 31, 2018, leases with U.S. government tenants at our properties accounted for 
approximately 1.5% of our aggregate annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2018.
Some of our tenants may be subject to increasing government price controls and other healthcare cost-containment 
measures.
Government healthcare cost-containment measures can significantly affect our tenants’ revenue and profitability. In many 
countries outside the U.S., government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our pharmaceutical 
industry tenants’ products are sold. In a number of European Union (“EU”) Member States, the pricing and/or reimbursement of 
prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control, and legislators, policymakers, and healthcare insurance funds 
continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid 
to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the EU. In the U.S., our pharmaceutical industry tenants are subject 
to substantial pricing pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance programs, and pharmacy benefit managers. In 
addition, many state legislative proposals could further negatively affect pricing and/or reimbursement for our pharmaceutical 
industry tenants’ products. Also, the pricing environment for pharmaceuticals continues to be in the political spotlight in the U.S. 
Pharmaceutical and medical device product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. 
Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under 
the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their 
populations who are not Medicaid eligible. We anticipate that pricing pressures from both governments and private payers inside 
and outside the U.S. will become more severe over time.
Changes in U.S. federal government funding for the FDA, NIH, and other government agencies could hinder their 
ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, properly administer drug innovation, or prevent new products and 
services from being developed or commercialized by our life science tenants, which could negatively impact our business.
The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and 
funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at 
the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the NIH and other government agencies 
that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.
The ability of the FDA, the NIH, and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly 
dependent on the levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Delays 
in filling or replacing key positions could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, the NIH, and other agencies to fulfill their 
functions and could greatly impact healthcare and the drug industry.
In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law. This legislation is designed to advance medical 
innovation and empower the FDA with the authority to directly hire positions related to drug and device development and review. 
In the past, the FDA was often unable to offer key leadership candidates (including scientists) competitive compensation packages 
as compared to those offered by private industry. The 21st Century Cures Act is designed to streamline the agency’s hiring process 
and enable the FDA to compete for leadership talent by expanding the narrow ranges that are provided in prior compensation 
structures.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  28
However, any future government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits may include reduced allocations to 
the FDA, the NIH, and other related government agencies. These budgetary pressures may result in a reduced ability by the FDA 
and the NIH to perform their respective roles and may have a related impact on academic institutions and research laboratories 
whose funding is fully or partially dependent on both the level and the timing of funding from government sources.
In December 2018, the U.S. Congress failed to enact a budget for the upcoming fiscal year’s government operations and 
the U.S. President rejected a stopgap funding bill to fund the government into early 2019, which resulted in a partial government 
shutdown that took place from December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019. During this period, the FDA and certain other 
science agencies temporarily shut down select non-essential operations. The FDA maintained only operations deemed to be 
essential public health-related functions and halted the acceptance of new medical product applications and routine regulatory and 
compliance work for medical products and certain drugs and foods during the shutdown. The shutdown ended on January 25, 
2019, when the President signed a bill to temporarily reopen the government through February 15, 2019, during which further 
negotiations are expected. If a resolution is not agreed upon, it is possible a second partial government shutdown may occur.
Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including those caused by the government shutdown, may slow the time 
necessary for new drugs and devices to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies and the healthcare and 
drug industries’ ability to deliver new products to the market in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our tenants’ 
operating results and business. Interruptions to the function of the FDA and other government agencies could adversely affect the 
demand for office/laboratory space and significantly impact our operating results and our business.
Changes in laws and regulations that control drug pricing for government programs may adversely impact our 
operating results and our business.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is the federal agency within the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid. 
The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 that went into effect on January 1, 2006 (which also made changes to the public Part C 
Medicare health plan program), explicitly prohibits government entities from directly negotiating drug prices with manufacturers. 
Recently, there has been significant public outcry against price increases viewed to be unfair and unwarranted. President Trump has 
endorsed having government programs such as Medicare bid and negotiate the price of drugs directly with drug companies. 
Currently, the outcome of potential reforms and changes to government negotiation/regulation to drug pricing is unknown. 
Changes in policy that limit prices may reduce the financial incentives for the research and development efforts that lead to discovery 
and production of new therapies and solutions to life-threatening conditions. Negative impacts of new policies could adversely affect 
our tenants’ businesses, including life science and technology companies, which may reduce the demand for office/laboratory space 
and negatively impact our operating results and our business.
The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) may 
subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, 
or financial condition.
There are significant corporate governance- and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that 
required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly 
traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. 
Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a 
diversion of management’s time from other business activities. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly affect 
other participants in the real estate and capital markets, such as banks, investment funds, and interest rate hedge providers, could 
have indirect, but material, impacts on our business. The U.S. President has also proposed to repeal certain provisions of the Dodd-
Frank Act. Given the uncertainty associated with the Dodd-Frank Act itself and the manner in which its provisions are 
implemented by various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on 
our future operations is unclear. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of business activities, require 
changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business in general.

The ongoing implementation of derivatives regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks 
associated with our business.
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regulates derivatives transactions, which include certain instruments that we use in our 
risk management activities. It remains impossible at this time to predict the full effects on our hedging activities of the derivatives-
related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and SEC 
thereunder, or the timing of such effects. While the CFTC has implemented most of its derivatives-related regulations under the 
Dodd-Frank Act, it has not yet adopted certain of those regulations. In addition, CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo has 
stated his view that certain existing CFTC regulations for swaps should be revised, including, without limitation, certain CFTC 
rules pertaining to swaps that are traded on swap execution facilities. The impact of any future new or revised CFTC derivatives 
regulations, or new or revised CFTC interpretations of existing regulations, is unknown, but they could result in, among other 
things, increases in the costs to us of swaps and other derivatives contracts, and decreases in the number and/or creditworthiness of 
available hedge counterparties. Furthermore, at this time the SEC’s regulations for security-based swaps have generally not yet 
been implemented and their potential impact on our ability to hedge risks cannot yet be known.  
In addition, we may enter into hedging transactions with counterparties based in the EU, Canada, or other jurisdictions 
which, like the U.S., are in the process of implementing regulations for derivatives. Non-U.S. regulations may apply to such 
derivatives transactions. The potential impact of such non-U.S. regulations is not fully known and may include, among other 
things, increased costs for our hedging transactions.
Global factors
  A global financial crisis, high structural unemployment levels, and other events or circumstances beyond our control may 
adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual commitments, and access to capital.
What began initially in 2007 and 2008 as a “subprime” mortgage crisis turned into an extraordinary U.S. and worldwide 
structural economic and financial crisis, coupled with the rapid decline of the consumer economy. From 2008 through 2010, 
significant concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, and a 
declining real estate market in the U.S. contributed to increased volatility, diminished expectations for the economy and the markets, 
and high levels of structural unemployment by historical standards. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices and fluctuating 
business and consumer confidence, precipitated a steep economic decline. From 2011 through 2018, the U.S. economy showed 
significant signs of improvement, but other economies around the world, including Latin America, continue to demonstrate sluggish, 
stagnant, or slowing growth. Further, severe financial and structural strains on the banking and financial systems have led to 
significant lack of trust and confidence in the global credit and financial system. Consumers and money managers have liquidated and 
may liquidate equity investments, and consumers and banks have held and may hold cash and other lower-risk investments, which has 
resulted in significant and, in some cases, catastrophic declines in the equity capitalization of companies and failures of financial 
institutions. Although U.S. bank earnings and liquidity are on the rebound, the potential of significant future bank credit losses creates 
uncertainty for the lending outlook.
  Further downgrades of the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating and an economic crisis in Europe could negatively 
impact our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings.
Previous U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, together with sovereign debt conditions in Europe, have increased the 
possibility of additional downgrades of sovereign credit ratings and economic slowdowns. There is no guarantee that future debt 
ceiling or federal spending legislation will not fail. 
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. from “AAA” to “AA+” in 
August 2011. Although Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services maintains a stable outlook on the U.S. credit rating, further fiscal 
impasses within the federal government may result in future downgrades. The impact of any further downgrades to the U.S. 
government’s sovereign credit rating, or its perceived creditworthiness, is inherently unpredictable and could adversely affect the U.S. 
and global financial markets and economic conditions. 
In addition, certain European nations experienced in the recent past varying degrees of financial stress, including Greece, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Although these economies are continuing to recover or have already gone through a gradual 
recovery, we do not know whether the economic growth will be slowed by the prospect of Brexit or whether the prior sovereign 
financial difficulties within the EU governments will reemerge with a higher degree of negative impact to the financial markets. 
Market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of European banks and insurers to these EU peripheral nations have resulted in 
a widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some EU financial institutions. There can be no assurance that 
government or other measures to aid economic recovery will be effective.

These developments, and concerns over the U.S. government’s fiscal policies in general, could cause interest rates and 
borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, the 
lowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may exert downward pressure on the market price 
of our common stock. Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations.
Financial volatility and geopolitical instability outside of the U.S. may adversely impact the U.S. and global economies.
During 2018, global growth weakened, trade tensions heightened, and several developing economies, most notably Argentina 
and Turkey, experienced financial trouble, soaring inflation and interest rates, and a significant depreciation of local currencies. 
Economies of developing countries like Venezuela remain in a long-term crisis with current political turmoil exacerbating their 
economic problems and rendering a bleak near-term outlook. Policies of advanced economies have a profound effect on emerging 
markets and ramifications of any trade war involving an advanced economy, like of that between the U.S. and China, could further 
contribute to the adverse economic and political conditions of emerging and other developed economies. In addition, there are ongoing 
security concerns about North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capabilities, uncertainty regarding North Korea’s actions, 
its relations with the U.S. and the international community in general, which have created a global security issue that may adversely 
affect international business and economic conditions. 
It is not possible to predict to what extent regional economic and political instability of emerging economies or trade conflicts 
may negatively impact other developing or developed economies around the world, including the U.S. If these macroeconomic and 
political issues are not managed appropriately, they could lead to currency devaluation, sovereign debt increases, banking crises, and 
other financial and political turmoil and uncertainty. Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on 
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.
We have properties and operations in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the local currency, and we thus are subject to 
international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency. In 
particular, a significant decrease or volatility in the value of the Canadian dollar or other currencies in countries where we may have 
an investment could materially affect our results of operations. We may attempt to mitigate such effects by borrowing in the local 
foreign currency in which we invest. Any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not 
qualify under gross income tests that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT.
Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may 
adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.
We hold certain instruments in our debt profile in which interest rates move in direct relation to LIBOR, depending on our 
selection of borrowing options. Beginning in 2008, concerns have been raised that some of the member banks surveyed by the BBA in 
connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR across a range of maturities and currencies may have underreported, overreported, or 
otherwise manipulated the interbank lending rate applicable to them in order to profit on their derivatives positions or to avoid an 
appearance of capital insufficiency or adverse reputational or other consequences that might have resulted from reporting interbank 
lending rates higher than those they actually submitted. A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with their 
regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and investigations have been instigated by 
regulators and government authorities in various jurisdictions. Other member banks may also enter into such settlements with, or have 
proceedings brought by, their regulators or law enforcement agencies in the future. If manipulation of LIBOR occurred, it may have 
resulted in LIBOR having been artificially lower (or higher) than it would otherwise have been. Any such manipulation could have 
occurred over a substantial period of time.
On September 28, 2012, British regulators published a report on the review of LIBOR. The report concluded that LIBOR 
should be retained as a benchmark but recommended a comprehensive reform of LIBOR, including replacing the BBA with a new 
independent administrator of LIBOR. Based on this report, final rules for the regulation and supervision of LIBOR by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) were published and came into effect on April 2, 2013 (the “FCA Rules”). In particular, the FCA Rules 
include requirements that (i) an independent LIBOR administrator monitor and survey LIBOR submissions to identify breaches of 
practice standards and/or potentially manipulative behavior and (ii) firms submitting data to LIBOR establish and maintain a clear 
conflict-of-interest policy and appropriate systems and controls. In response, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”) was 
appointed as the independent LIBOR administrator, effective in early 2014. It is not possible to predict the effect of the FCA Rules, 
31
31  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
any changes in the methods pursuant to which LIBOR is determined, the administration of LIBOR by IBA, and any other reforms to 
LIBOR that will be enacted in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In addition, any changes announced by the FCA, the BBA, IBA, or 
any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is 
determined, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in 
reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the level of the index. Fluctuation or discontinuation of LIBOR would affect 
our interest expense and earnings and the fair value of certain of our financial instruments. We rely on interest rate hedge agreements 
to mitigate our exposure to such interest rate risk on a portion of our debt obligations. However, there is no assurance these 
arrangements will be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
In addition, in November 2014, the U.S. Federal Reserve established a working group composed of large U.S. financial 
institutions, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), to identify a set of alternative interest reference rates to LIBOR. 
In a May 2016 interim report, the ARRC narrowed its choice to two LIBOR alternatives. The first choice was the Overnight Bank 
Funding Rate (“OBFR”), which consists of domestic and foreign unsecured borrowing in U.S. dollars. The U.S. Federal Reserve has 
been calculating and publishing the OBFR since March 2016. The second alternative rate to LIBOR was the Treasury General 
Collateral Rate, which is composed of repo transactions secured by treasuries or other assets accepted as collateral by the majority of 
intermediaries in the repo market.
In June 2017, the ARRC selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by reference to 
short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is 
observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast to LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-
looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate 
backed by government securities, it does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely 
to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. The first publication of 
SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. Although daily pricing resets for SOFR have been noted 
to be more volatile than that of LIBOR, especially at month end, there is no sufficient evidence to establish how SOFR volatility 
compares to that of LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As 
such, the future of LIBOR and potential alternatives at this time remains uncertain. 
  On July 27, 2017, the FCA announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear 
whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. When LIBOR ceases to exist, 
we may need to amend the credit and loan agreements with our lenders that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate 
based on a new standard that is established, if any. The transition to an alternative rate will require careful and deliberate consideration 
and implementation so as to not disrupt the stability of financial markets. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to an 
alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, 
any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.
New rules from the SEC that govern money market funds may significantly impact the volatility of LIBOR interest rates.
On July 23, 2014, the SEC adopted rules to make structural and operational reforms to address risks of investor runs in 
money market funds. These changes affect prime money market funds, which invest in corporate debt securities, differently than they 
do government money market funds, which invest in securities that are collateralized solely by government securities. The rules 
require a floating net asset value for institutional prime money market funds and also allow the funds to impose liquidity fees and 
redemption gates to further prevent large-scale investor runs. The rules provided for a two-year transition period that expired on 
October 15, 2016. In anticipation of this change, a substantial amount of assets across the broader market previously invested in prime 
money market funds had been moved to government money market funds, causing a reduction in the availability of bank unsecured 
funding for European and non-U.S. banks. Government money market funds are not available to foreign banks for their dollar-funding 
needs. As the transition deadline neared and passed, a supply-and-demand mismatch for dollar funds emerged from foreign banks, 
causing LIBOR to increase significantly. There can be no assurance that LIBOR will stabilize subsequent to the transition period for 
these new regulations or whether there will be continued pressure on LIBOR or significant volatility in LIBOR. Any volatility in 
LIBOR would affect our interest expense and earnings and the fair value of certain of our financial instruments. We rely on interest 
rate hedge agreements to mitigate our exposure to such interest rate risk on a portion of our debt obligations. However, there is no 
assurance these arrangements will be effective in reducing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
32
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  32
Adoption of the Basel III standards and other regulatory standards affecting financial institutions may negatively impact 
our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements. 
In response to various financial crises and the volatility of financial markets, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(the “Basel Committee”) adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework (“Basel III” or the “Basel III Standards”). The final 
package of Basel III reforms was approved by the G20 leaders in November 2010. In January 2013, the Basel Committee agreed to 
delay implementation of the Basel III Standards and expanded the scope of assets permitted to be included in certain banks’ liquidity 
measurements. U.S. banking regulators have elected to implement substantially all of the Basel III Standards, with implementation of 
Basel III commencing in 2014 and scheduled to be incrementally implemented through 2019.
Since approving the Basel III Standards, U.S. regulators have also issued rules that impose upon the most systemically 
significant banking organizations in the U.S. supplementary leverage ratio standards (the “SLR Standards”) more stringent than those 
of the Basel III Standards. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has adopted a final rule that establishes a methodology to identify 
whether a U.S. bank holding company is a global systemically important banking organization (“GSIB”). Any firm identified as a 
GSIB would be subject to a risk-based capital surcharge that is calibrated based on its systemic risk profile. Under the final rule, the 
capital surcharge began phasing in on January 1, 2016, and will become fully effective on January 1, 2019.
On September 3, 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the Basel Committee’s liquidity coverage 
ratio (the “LCR”) in the U.S. (the “LCR Final Rule”). The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally 
active banking organizations to improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from idiosyncratic or market stress, 
and to improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR Final Rule contains requirements that are in certain 
respects more stringent than the Basel Committee’s LCR. The LCR measures an institution’s high-quality liquid assets against its net 
cash outflows. Under the LCR Final Rule, the LCR began phasing in on January 1, 2015, at 80%, with full implementation beginning 
on January 1, 2017.
  U.S. regulators have also issued and proposed rules that impose additional restrictions on the business activities of financial 
institutions, including their trading and investment activities. For example, in December 2013, U.S. regulators adopted a final rule 
implementing a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that has become known as the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule generally prohibits 
certain U.S. and foreign financial institutions from investing in or sponsoring “covered funds,” which include private equity funds or 
hedge funds and certain other proprietary activities. The effects of the Volcker Rule are uncertain, but it is in any event likely to curtail 
various banking activities, which in turn could result in uncertainties in the financial markets.
The implementation of the Basel III Standards, the SLR Standards, the GSIB capital surcharge, the LCR Final Rule, the 
Volcker Rule, and other similar rules and regulations could cause an increase in capital requirements for, and place other financial 
constraints on, both U.S. and foreign financial institutions from which we borrow, which may negatively impact our access to 
financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.
  Significant developments stemming from the recent U.S. presidential election or the U.K.’s referendum on membership in 
the EU could have a material adverse effect on us. 
On January 20, 2017, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the president of the U.S. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump 
expressed apprehension toward existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and has imposed 
significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly from China, Mexico, and Canada. Mr. Trump has also 
spearheaded significant efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by 
government programs. Any changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the 
health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries 
where we or our tenants operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
 
  According to a consensus of all U.S. government intelligence agencies, state-sponsored Russian operatives interfered with the
recent U.S. presidential election of 2016. In May 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate this matter and to determine 
whether the Trump campaign or any individuals associated with such campaign colluded with the Russians. The mandate of the 
special counsel allows this investigation to scrutinize other areas that may be related to the Russian interference. At least four 
Congressional committees are also investigating this matter and have interviewed witnesses in both open and closed sessions in order 
to determine the extent of the Russian meddling in the U.S. election, the vulnerability of the U.S. election system to future attacks by 
Russian or other state operatives, and the extent, if any, to which Mr. Trump and his campaign colluded with the Russian government 
in order to mislead the American electorate. As these investigations proceed and the facts become clearer to the American people and 
the capital markets, it is uncertain the extent to which this will affect economic conditions or distract Congress from other endeavors.
33

Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the EU (known as “Brexit”). The 
U.K. government initiated the official EU withdrawal process on March 29, 2017, and the exit from the EU is expected to occur by the 
end of March 2019. However, the Prime Minister has had difficulty negotiating and passing a withdrawal agreement through the 
members of Parliament. If an agreement can be passed by March 29, 2019, there will be a transition period through December 2020 to 
allow for businesses and individuals to adjust to its changes. Otherwise, the U.K. must leave the EU without an agreement or 
transition period in place. This Brexit decision has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the U.K. and the EU, and 
this uncertainty may last for years. Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact 
of the U.K. referendum. In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the U.K. and other 
countries, including the U.S., and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the U.K. These possible negative 
impacts, and others resulting from the U.K.’s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results 
and our tenants’ businesses.
Other factors
Changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations.
As a response, in large part, to perceived abuses and deficiencies in current regulations believed to have caused or 
exacerbated the recent global financial crisis, legislative, regulatory, and accounting standard-setting bodies around the world are 
engaged in an intensive, wide-ranging examination and rewriting of the laws, regulations, and accounting standards that have 
constituted the basic playing field of global and domestic business for several decades. In many jurisdictions, including the U.S., the 
legislative and regulatory response has included the extensive reorganization of existing regulatory and rule-making agencies and 
organizations, and the establishment of new agencies with broad powers. This reorganization has disturbed longstanding regulatory 
and industry relationships and established procedures.
The rule-making and administrative efforts have focused principally on the areas perceived as having contributed to the 
financial crisis, including banking, investment banking, securities regulation, and real estate finance, with spillover impacts on many 
other areas. These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry, and 
many other businesses, that is unprecedented in the U.S. at least since the wave of lawmaking, regulatory reform, and government 
reorganization that followed the Great Depression.
The global financial crisis and the aggressive reaction of the government and accounting profession thereto have occurred 
against a backdrop of increasing globalization and internationalization of financial and securities regulation that began prior to the 
recent financial crisis. As a result of this ongoing trend, financial and investment activities previously regulated almost exclusively at a 
local or national level are increasingly being regulated, or at least coordinated, on an international basis, with national rule-making and 
standard-setting groups relinquishing varying degrees of local and national control to achieve more uniform regulation and reduce the 
ability of market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions. This globalization trend has continued, arguably 
with an increased sense of urgency and importance, since the financial crisis.
This high degree of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with considerable additional uncertainty regarding the underlying 
condition and prospects of global, domestic, and local economies, has created a business environment that makes business planning 
and projections even more uncertain than is ordinarily the case for businesses in the financial and real estate sectors.
In the commercial real estate sector in which we operate, the uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting 
standard-setting authorities to fundamentally rewrite major bodies of accounting literature constitute a significant source of 
uncertainty as to the basic rules of business engagement. Changes in accounting standards and requirements, including the potential 
requirement that U.S. public companies prepare financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards, proposed 
lease standards, and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of “fair value” measures, may have a 
significant effect on our financial results and on the results of our tenants, which would in turn have a secondary impact on us. New 
accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing pronouncements are likely to continue to occur at an accelerated pace as a 
result of recent Congressional and regulatory actions and continuing efforts by the accounting profession itself to reform and 
modernize its principles and procedures.
Although we have not been as directly affected by the wave of new legislation and regulation as banks and investment banks, 
we may also be adversely affected by new or amended laws or regulations; by changes in federal, state, or foreign tax laws and 
regulations; and by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. In the U.S., the financial crisis and 
continuing economic slowdown prompted a variety of legislative, regulatory, and accounting profession responses.
34
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  34
The federal legislative response culminated in the enactment on July 21, 2010, of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act 
contains far-reaching provisions that substantially revise, or provide for the revision of, longstanding, fundamental rules governing the 
banking and investment banking industries and provide for the broad restructuring of the regulatory authorities in these areas. The 
Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, profound changes in the ground rules for financial business 
activities in the U.S.
To a large degree, the impacts of the legislative, regulatory, and accounting reforms to date are still not clear. Many of the 
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rule 
making by regulatory authorities. While we do not currently expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant impact on our business 
activities, the Dodd-Frank Act’s impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act, including 
current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory 
proposals directed at the financial or real estate industry or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the U.S. Congress, may 
limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or intensify the regulatory framework within which we operate in ways that are not 
currently identifiable. The Dodd-Frank Act also has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, substantial changes and 
dislocations in the banking industry and the financial services sector in ways that could have significant effects on, for example, the 
availability and pricing of unsecured credit, commercial mortgage credit, and derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, which are 
important aspects of our business. Accordingly, new laws, regulations, and accounting standards, as well as changes to, or new 
interpretations of, currently accepted accounting practices in the real estate industry, may adversely affect our results of operations.
We may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.
Our properties are subject to many federal, state, and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety, and 
other requirements. If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage 
awards to private litigants. We do not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed. 
Changes in these regulatory requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. These expenditures could 
have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
  For example, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, also referred to as Proposition 65, requires 
“clear and reasonable” warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or 
reproductive toxicity. We believe that we comply with Proposition 65 requirements; however, there can be no assurance that we will 
not be adversely affected by litigation or regulatory enforcement relating to Proposition 65. In addition, there can be no assurance that 
the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations will not be significant or will not adversely affect our ability to 
meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
We may incur significant costs in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.
Under the ADA, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities must meet federal requirements related to 
access and use by disabled persons. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this 
law. In addition, non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.
A number of additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by disabled persons. These 
regulations may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations. These expenditures may have an adverse 
impact on overall returns on our investments.
We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.
We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have 
a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. For example, most of our properties are located along the east 
and west coasts of the U.S. To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience 
increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our 
properties or in our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by 
increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, by increasing the cost of 
energy, and by increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a 
material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.

We may incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws.
Federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real 
estate, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our properties. The 
cost of investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage 
available to us. In addition, the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our ability to 
lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as collateral.
Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay government entities or third parties for property damage and 
for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or 
caused the contamination. Even if more than one party was responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for all of 
the cleanup costs. In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, or jointly 
responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing building materials. These 
laws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing building materials and may allow third parties to seek 
recovery from us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers. We have detected asbestos-containing building materials at 
some of our properties, but we do not expect that they will result in material environmental costs or liabilities for us.
Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:
•  The discharge of stormwater, wastewater, and any water pollutants;
•  The emission of air pollutants;
•  The generation, management, and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances, or wastes; and
•  Workplace health and safety.
Many of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. 
Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental 
liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental 
laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities.
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at our properties. We 
intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions. This type of assessment generally 
includes a site inspection, interviews, and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling. These assessments and certain 
additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material 
adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.
Additional investigations have included, as appropriate:
•  Asbestos surveys;
•  Radon surveys;
•  Lead-based paint surveys;
•  Mold surveys;
•  Additional public records review;
•  Subsurface sampling; and
•  Other testing.
Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our current properties have not revealed, and that assessments on future 
acquisitions will not reveal, all environmental liabilities. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we 
are unaware that may result in substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements. Costs and capital expenditures 
relating to the evolving requirements depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of new standards. Due to concern 
over the risks of climate change, a more restrictive regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas pollution might be implemented, 
including the adoption of carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, and increased efficiency standards. These requirements could make our 
operations more expensive and lengthen our project times. The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including 
greenhouse gas regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, changes in environmental 
36
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  36
regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or 
safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock. 
We may be unable to meet our sustainability goals.
We seek to make a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our tenants, stockholders, 
employees, and the communities in which we live and work. In support of these efforts, we set specific sustainability goals to reduce 
the environmental impact of buildings in operation and for new ground-up construction projects. There are significant risks that may 
prevent us from achieving these goals, including the possibility that:
•  Change in market conditions may affect our ability to deploy capital for projects that reduce energy consumption, 
greenhouse gas pollution and potable water consumption, and provide waste savings.
•  Our tenants might be unwilling or unable to accept potential incremental expenses associated with our sustainability 
programs, including expenses to comply with requirements stipulated under building certification standards such as 
LEED, WELL, and Fitwel.
  The realization of any of the above risks could significantly impact our reputation, our ability to continue developing 
properties in markets where high levels of LEED certification contribute to our efforts to obtain building permits and entitlements, and 
our ability to attract tenants who include LEED certification among their priorities when selecting a location to lease.
  We may invest or spend the net proceeds from the offering of our unsecured senior notes payable due in 2024 in ways with 
which investors may not agree and in ways that may not earn a profit.
  The net proceeds from the offering of our unsecured senior notes payable due in 2024 (“the 2024 notes”) will be used to fund, 
in whole or in part, Eligible Green Projects (as defined below), including the development and redevelopment of such projects. The 
net proceeds from this offering were initially used to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit. We then 
allocated the funds to recently completed and future Eligible Green Projects.
  There can be no assurance that the projects funded with the proceeds from the 2024 notes will meet investor criteria and 
expectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance. In particular, no assurance is given that the use of such 
proceeds for any Eligible Green Projects will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or 
requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply, 
whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own bylaws or other governing rules or investment portfolio 
mandates (in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any projects or uses, the 
subject of or related to, the relevant Eligible Green Projects). Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design, 
construction and operation of the projects or the projects may become controversial or criticized by activist groups or other 
stakeholders. In addition, although we will limit the use of proceeds from the 2024 notes to Eligible Green Projects, there can be no 
assurance that one or more development, redevelopment and tenant improvement projects that we expect will receive a LEED 
certification will actually receive such certification.
  ‘‘Eligible Green Projects’’ are defined as:
•  New class A development properties that have received or are expected to receive Gold or Platinum LEED certification;
•  Existing class A redevelopment properties that have received or are expected to receive Gold or Platinum LEED 
certification; and
•  Tenant improvements that have received or are expected to receive Gold or Platinum LEED certification.
  Eligible Green Projects include projects with disbursements made in the three years preceding the issue date of the 2024 
notes. We intend to spend the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 notes within two years following issuance of the 2024 
notes. LEED is a voluntary, third party building certification process developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (‘‘USGBC’’), a 
non-profit organization. The USGBC developed the LEED certification process to (i) evaluate the environmental performance from a 
whole-building perspective over a building’s life cycle, (ii) provide a definitive standard for what constitutes a ‘‘green building,’’ (iii) 
enhance environmental awareness among architects and building contractors, and (iv) encourage the design and construction of 
energy-efficient, water-conserving buildings that use sustainable or green resources and materials.

Changes in U.S. accounting standards may adversely impact us.
The regulatory boards and government agencies that determine financial accounting standards and disclosures in the U.S., 
which include the FASB and the IASB (collectively, the “Boards”) and the SEC, continually change and update the financial 
accounting standards we must follow. 
In February 2016, the Boards issued an ASU that changes certain aspects of accounting for leases for both lessees and lessors. 
Since then, several additional ASUs have been issued to clarify implementation issues, which became effective for us on January 1, 
2019. These ASUs could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, which in turn could also 
significantly impact the market price of our common stock. Such potential impacts include, without limitation:
•  Significant changes to our balance sheet relating to the recognition of operating leases as assets or liabilities based on 
existing lease terms and whether we are the lessor or lessee;
•  Significant changes in the timing of revenue recognition (related to lease arrangements in which we are the lessor) or 
expense recognition (related to the lease arrangements in which we are the lessee) stemming from the potential 
classification of financing or sales-type leases under the new ASU, for leases that are classified as operating leases under 
the current accounting standards;
•  Significant fluctuations in our reported results of operations, including an increase in our expenses related to 
amortization of new lease-related assets and/or liabilities and assumed interest costs with leases;
•  Significant fluctuations in our reported results of operations, including an increase in our general and administrative 
expenses related to payroll costs, legal costs, and other out-of-pocket costs incurred as part of the leasing process prior to 
the execution of a lease that no longer qualifies for capitalization as initial direct costs and instead are expensed as 
incurred; and
•  Significant fluctuations in our reported results of operations that may result from the classification of future ground 
leases as finance leases rather than operating leases. Prior to January 1, 2019, the effective date of the new lease ASUs, 
all ground leases were accounted for as operating leases, with ground lease payments straight-lined over the term of the 
ground lease. Under the new lease accounting, ground leases can qualify for classification as finance leases, which are 
recognized in operating results using an effective interest method. The classification of ground leases as operating leases 
or finance leases may result in different timing of expense recognition over the term of the ground leases.
  In addition, the new accounting updates could make leasing/re-leasing of our space less attractive to our potential and current 
tenants, which could reduce overall occupancy of our properties. Under the lease guidance effective prior to January 1, 2019, our 
tenants did not reflect operating leases with us as a liability on their balance sheets, but only provided a disclosure of future minimum 
payments associated with the operating lease in the footnotes to their financial statements. The new lease standard will require that 
lessees record on their balance sheets their rights and obligations pertaining to operating leases with a term of over 12 months. 
Changes in lease accounting standards could potentially impact the structure and terms of future leases since our tenants may seek to 
limit lease terms to avoid recognizing lease obligations in their financial statements. The new rules may also make lease renewal 
options less attractive because, under certain circumstances, the rules will require a tenant to assume that a renewal right will be 
exercised and accrue a liability relating to the longer lease term. Shorter lease terms and a reduction in RSF leased may lead to 
reduction in occupancy rates and decline in rental revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
  Furthermore, in January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that amended the accounting for certain equity investments. The 
update became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The core principle of the ASU involves the measurement of equity investments at 
fair value and the recognition of changes in fair value of those investments during each reporting period in net income. This ASU 
increased the volatility of our earnings during the year ended December 31, 2018, and is expected to continue introducing volatility to 
our results of operations, as a result of new guidance requiring us to immediately recognize in net income (i) unrealized gains and 
losses on our equity investments and (ii) impairments deemed not to be other than temporary under the previous guidance. The 
increased volatility of our earnings could adversely affect investors and analysts’ ability to form reliable expectations of our future 
performance, which could negatively impact analysts’ “buy,” “sell,” or “hold” recommendations for our common stock. Therefore, our 
share price could be negatively affected by causes beyond our control. 
  Any difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, particularly for the new leases ASUs, including 
the ability to modify our accounting systems and to update our policies, procedures, information systems, and internal controls over 
financial reporting, could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, which in turn could harm our operating results or cause 
us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Significant changes in the new lease ASUs could cause fluctuations in revenue and 
expense recognition and materially affect our results of operations. We also anticipate an increase to our general and administrative 
38
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  38
expenses resulting from the expensing of initial direct costs that no longer qualify for capitalization. This could adversely affect our 
reported results of operations, profitability, and financial statements. Additionally, the adoption of new accounting standards could also 
affect the calculation of our debt covenants. It cannot be assured that we will be able to work with our lenders to successfully amend 
our debt covenants in response to changes in accounting standards.
Changes in the system for establishing U.S. accounting standards may result in adverse fluctuations in our reported asset 
and liability values and earnings and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations.
In December 2018, the U.S. Congress failed to enact a budget for the upcoming fiscal year’s government operations and the 
President rejected a stopgap funding bill to fund the government into early 2019, which resulted in a partial government shutdown that 
took place from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019. The shutdown ended on January 25, 2019, when the President signed a bill 
to temporarily reopen the government through February 15, 2019, during which further negotiations are expected. If a resolution is not 
agreed upon, it is possible a second partial government shutdown may occur. The shutdown had affected certain key agencies at the 
federal government level, including the SEC, which closed partial non-essential operations. The SEC operated limited functions to 
address emergency situations involving market integrity and investor protection. However, it suspended key functions, such as those 
related to enforcement actions and review of applications for initial public offerings. The closure, and future closures, of the SEC 
could result in uncertainty regarding regulatory actions, issuance of new or clarifications of existing rules and regulations, disruptions 
in the initial public offerings of companies, including those of our tenants and companies in which we hold equity investments, and 
investigations and enforcement actions by the SEC. The long term impacts resulting from a prolonged closure of the SEC and other 
similar agencies are uncertain and may adversely affect our business operations or our tenants and companies in which we hold equity 
investments.
Accounting for public companies in the U.S. has historically been conducted in accordance with GAAP as established by the 
FASB, an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for U.S. publicly held companies. The IASB 
is a London-based independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of IFRS. IFRS generally reflects 
accounting practices that prevail in Europe and in developed nations in other parts of the world.
IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP. Among other things, IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value” models 
of accounting for assets and liabilities than GAAP. “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often 
resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and 
liability valuation.
The SEC released a final report on its IFRS work plan, which indicates the SEC still needs to analyze and consider whether 
IFRS should be incorporated into the U.S. financial reporting system. It is unclear at this time how and when the SEC will propose 
that GAAP and IFRS be harmonized if the decision to incorporate is adopted. In addition, incorporating a new method of accounting 
and adopting IFRS will be a complex undertaking. We may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of IFRS. 
Since these are new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known, the 
magnitude of costs associated with this conversion is uncertain.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of IFRS on our financial condition and results of operations. Such 
evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more clarity regarding the specific proposed standards that will be adopted. Until 
there is more certainty with respect to the standards to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to IFRS 
could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations.
Changes in financial accounting standards may adversely impact our compliance with financial debt covenants.
Our unsecured senior notes payable contain financial covenants that are calculated based on GAAP at the date the 
instruments were issued. However, certain debt agreements, including those related to our unsecured senior line of credit and 
unsecured senior bank term loan, contain financial covenants whose calculations are based on current GAAP, which is subject to 
future changes. Our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements provide that our financial debt 
covenants be renegotiated in good faith to preserve the original intent of the existing financial covenant when such covenant is 
affected by an accounting standard change. For those debt agreements that require the renegotiation of financial covenants upon 
changes in accounting standards, there is no assurance that we will be successful in such negotiations or that the renegotiated 
covenants will not be more restrictive to us.

Extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business, which could harm our business and 
operating results.
We have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters, including, but not limited 
to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes, and fires. Such conditions may damage our properties, disrupt our operations, and adversely 
impact our tenants’ operations. There can be no assurance that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our 
properties, operations, or business.
Terrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our 
assets.
Terrorist attacks such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business, 
our operating results, and the market price of our common stock. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, 
which could reduce the demand for, and the value of, our properties. To the extent that future terrorist attacks impact our tenants, their 
businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations.
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures.
Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our 
internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer 
viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunications failures. Any system failure 
or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur 
additional significant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.
Security incidents through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology 
networks and related systems, cause a loss of assets or loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability 
under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could result in substantial reputational damage 
and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our 
common stock.
Information technology, communication networks, and related systems are essential to the operation of our business. We use 
these systems to manage our tenant and vendor relationships, internal communications, accounting and record-keeping systems, and 
many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and 
other information in our computer systems and networks, which also depend on the strength of our procedures and the effectiveness of 
our internal controls. 
A security incident may occur through physical break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized party, software 
vulnerabilities, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, employee theft or misuse, social engineering, or inadequate use of 
security controls. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information or transfer funds 
via illegal electronic spamming, phishing, spoofing or other tactics. Additionally, cyber attackers can develop and deploy malware, 
credential theft or guessing tools, and other malicious software programs to gain access to sensitive data or fraudulently obtain assets 
we hold. 
 
  We have implemented security measures to safeguard our systems and data and to manage cyber security risk. We monitor 
and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure, and invest in the development and enhancement of our controls 
designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that 
could have a security impact. We conduct periodic security awareness trainings of our employees to educate on how to identify and 
alert the management to phishing emails, spoofed or manipulated electronic communications, and other critical security threats. We’ve 
implemented internal controls around our treasury function including enhanced payment authorization procedures, verification 
requirements for new vendor set-up and vendor information changes, and bolstered outgoing payment notification process and account 
reconciliation procedures.   
  
  While, to date, we are not aware of having experienced a significant security incident or cyber attack, there can be no 
assurance that our actions, security measures, and controls designed to prevent, detect, or respond to intrusion; to limit access to data; 
to prevent loss, destruction, alteration, or exfiltration of business information; or to limit the negative impact from such attacks can 
provide absolute security against a security incident. A significant security incident involving our information systems or those of our 
tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud providers, or other third parties with whom we do business could lead to:
40
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  40
•  Theft of our cash, cash equivalents, or other liquid assets, including publicly traded securities;
•  Interruption in the operation of our systems, which may result in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits;
•  Unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or 
otherwise valuable information of ours or our tenants, and other business partners, which could be used to compete 
against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•  Inability to produce financial and operational data necessary to comply with rules and regulations from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, or other state and federal regulatory agencies;
•  Our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;
•  Significant management attention and resources required to remedy any damages that result;
•  Significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions; 
•  Violation of our lease agreements or other agreements; 
•  Damage to our reputation among our tenants, business partners, and investors;
•  Loss of business opportunities; and
•  Difficulties in employee retention and recruitment.
  A principal reason that we cannot provide absolute protection from security incidents is that it may not always be possible to 
anticipate, detect, or recognize threats to our systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all security incidents due 
to, among other things, the frequent change in techniques used in cyber attacks, which may not be recognized until launched, and the 
wide variety of sources from which a cyber attack can originate. We may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a 
security incident due to a cyber attack. A successful breach of our computer systems, software, networks, or other technology assets 
due to a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things:
•  The breadth of our operations and the high volume of transactions that our systems process;
•  The large number of our business partners; and
•  The proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks.
  The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be 
immediately clear. Therefore, in the event of an attack, it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be 
completed. During an investigation, we may not necessarily know the extent of the damage incurred or how best to remediate it, and 
certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, which could further increase the 
costs and consequences of a cyber attack.
  Even if we are not targeted directly, cyber attacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other 
businesses, including our tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud providers, and other third parties with whom we do business, 
could disrupt our normal business operations and networks. 
  We maintain insurance to protect ourselves against certain losses incurred in the event of a security incident or disruption of 
our information systems. However, we cannot be certain that the coverage is adequate to compensate for all damages that may arise. In 
addition, we cannot be certain that such insurance options will remain available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms, 
or at all.
  Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, 
or the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
General
As of December 31, 2018, we had 237 properties in North America containing approximately 26.3 million RSF of operating 
properties and development and redevelopment of new Class A properties (under construction or pre-construction), including 11 
properties that are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and six properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint 
ventures. See our definitions of annual rental revenue and operating statistics in the “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” section 
under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this annual report on 
Form 10-K for a description of the basis used to compute the aforementioned measures. The occupancy percentage of our operating 
properties in North America was 97.3% as of December 31, 2018. The exteriors of our properties typically resemble traditional office 
properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science and technology tenants. These 
improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-
term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:
•  Reinforced concrete floors;
•  Upgraded roof loading capacity;
•  Increased floor-to-ceiling heights;
•  Heavy-duty HVAC systems;
•  Enhanced environmental control technology;
•  Significantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and
•  Laboratory benches.
As of December 31, 2018, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of 29 properties in North 
America that accounted for approximately 12% of our total number of properties. Of these 29 properties, we held 16 properties in the 
Greater Boston market, six properties in the San Francisco market, two properties in the New York City market, two properties in the 
Seattle market, one property in the Maryland market, and two properties in the Research Triangle Park market pursuant to ground 
leasehold interests. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our ground lease rental expense aggregated 1.5% as a percentage of net 
operating income. Refer to further discussion in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Item 15. Exhibits and 
Financial Statement Schedules” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 708 leases with a total of 537 tenants, and 116, or 49%, of our 237 properties were single-
tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms of four to 11 years, while leases in our single-tenant 
buildings typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2018:
•  Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented 52% of our total annual rental revenue;
•  Approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all 
real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) 
in addition to base rent;
•  Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed 
(generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and
•  Approximately 96% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of capital expenditures (such as HVAC 
systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would typically 
be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases.
Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed 
improvements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our 
election. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain 
non-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.

Leasing activity
•  Executed a total of 207 leases, with a weighted-average lease term of 9.1 years, for 4.7 million RSF, including 1.7 
million RSF related to our development and redevelopment projects during the year ended December 31, 2018; leasing 
activity of 4.7 million RSF represents the second highest annual leasing activity in Alexandria’s history; and 
•  Solid rental rate increases of 24.1% and 14.1% (cash basis). Rental rate increase of 14.1% (cash basis) represents the 
highest increase during the past 10 years. 
  Approximately 58% of the 207 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2018, did not include concessions for 
free rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we granted tenant concessions/free rent averaging 2.2 months with respect to the 
4.7 million RSF leased.
 
  The following chart presents renewed/re-leased space and development/redevelopment/previously vacant space leased for the 
years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:
Lease structure
Our Same Properties total revenue growth of 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Same Properties net 
operating income and Same Properties net operating income (cash basis) increases for the year ended December 31, 2018, of 3.7% and 
9.2%, respectively, benefited significantly from strong market fundamentals. The limited supply of Class A space in AAA locations 
and strong demand from innovative tenants drove rental rate increases of 24.1% and 14.1% (cash basis) on 2.1 million renewed/re-
leased RSF, while a favorable triple net lease structure with contractual annual rent escalations resulted in both a consistent Same 
Properties operating margin of 71% and occupancy of 96.6% across our 185 Same Properties aggregating 17.2 million RSF. As of 
December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay 
substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases 
thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained contractual annual rent 
escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 96% of our leases (on an 
RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

Investments in real estate
  A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new 
Class A properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are 
focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide 
range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net 
operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to 
high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and 
greater long-term asset values. Our pre-construction activities are undertaken in order to get the property ready for its intended use and 
include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground 
building improvements.

To our knowledge, no legal proceedings are pending against us, other than routine actions and administrative proceedings, 
and other actions not deemed material, substantially all of which are expected to be covered by liability insurance and which, in the

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND 
ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
  Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ARE.” On January 15, 2019, the last reported sales price per 
share of our common stock was $120.93, and there were 398 holders of record of our common stock (excluding beneficial owners 
whose shares are held in the name of Cede & Co.). 
   To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable 
income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital 
gains. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flows available for distributions to 
meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional 
debt or equity capital. No dividends can be paid on our common stock unless we have paid full cumulative dividends on our 
preferred stock. From the date of issuance of our preferred stock through December 31, 2018, we have paid full cumulative 
dividends on our preferred stock. Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by, and made at the discretion of, 
our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including actual cash available for distribution to our stockholders, 
our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code, restrictions under Maryland law, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. We cannot assure 
our stockholders that we will make any future distributions.
  Refer to “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters”

A REIT industry-leading, high-quality tenant roster
  52% of annual rental revenue from investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants.
Continuation of strong rental rate growth and leasing activity
  Strong rental rate increases of 24.1% and 14.1% (cash basis) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The rental rate increase of 
14.1% (cash basis) represents our highest annual increase during the past 10 years. Our leasing activity aggregating 4.7 million RSF for 
2018 represents the second highest annual leasing activity in our history.
Sale of partial interest in core Class A property
  In February 2019, we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell a 60% interest in 75/125 Binney Street, a Class A property 
in our Cambridge submarket, for a sales price of $438 million, or $1,880 per RSF, representing a 4.3% capitalization rate on net operating 
income (cash basis), annualized for the three months ended December 31, 2018. We expect to complete this partial interest sale during 
the first quarter of 2019 and to reinvest these proceeds into our value-creation pipeline.
Key sale of unconsolidated real estate joint venture interest
  In September 2018, we sold our remaining 27.5% ownership interest in the unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owned 
360 Longwood Avenue, located in the Longwood Medical Area submarket at a gross sales price of $1,659 per RSF, with capitalization 
rates of 5.1% and 4.7% (cash basis). Our share of the contractual sales price, net of debt repaid, was $70.0 million, and our gain on sale 
was $35.7 million.

Increased common stock dividend
  Common stock dividend declared for the year ended December 31, 2018, of $3.73 per common share, up 28 cents, or 8%,

2019 Capital strategy
During 2019, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, 
which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. For further 
information, refer to the “Projected Results” section below within this Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Consistent with 2018, our capital strategy for 2019 includes the following elements:
•  Allocate capital to Class A properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban 
innovation clusters;
•  Continue to improve our credit profile;
•  Maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after 
dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in EBITDA, real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment 
sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as sales of equity;
•  Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•  Prudently ladder debt maturities;
•  Reduce short-term variable-rate debt;
•  Prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;
•  Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and
•  Maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.
  Given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental EBITDA from our development and redevelopment of new Class 
A properties, we expect to be able to debt fund a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. We expect to 
continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction 
loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. We expect to continue to maintain a significant 
proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and 
secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital 
structure. In addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net 
cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, 
partial interest sales, and other debt and equity capital.
80
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  80
Improved cost of capital
  As part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service 
development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental EBITDA. 
As our EBITDA grows in 2019 and beyond, this growth in EBITDA should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis 
and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. Additionally, the resulting improvement in our 
balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of 
capital. In addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. For the year 
ended December 31, 2018, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 88%.

Investments On January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard that requires us, on a prospective basis, to present our equity investments at fair value whenever fair value (or NAV) is readily available. For investments without readily available fair values, we adjust the cost basis whenever such investments have an observable price change. Further adjustments are not made until another price change, if any, is observed. Refer to Note 7 – “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Results of operations
  We present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results 
and provide context for the disclosures included in our annual report on Form 10-K. We believe this tabular presentation promotes a 
better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison 
of our operating results from period to period. We also believe this tabular presentation will supplement an understanding of our 
disclosures and real estate operating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of held for sale assets are related to 
corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption 
charges are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized 
gains or losses on non-real estate investments and impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments are not related to the 
operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment decisions and 
external market conditions. Significant items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure, for current periods are 
described in further detail within this Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K. Items included in net income attributable to

to $863.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our 
Non-Same Properties aggregating $117.0 million related to 2.0 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into 
service subsequent to January 1, 2017, and 24 operating properties aggregating 2.4 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1,

$818.7 million, compared to $788.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to significant 
rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2017 and occupancy increase. Refer to the “Leasing 
Activity” section of Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Tenant recoveries
Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $44.9 million, or 17.3%, to $304.1 million, compared 
to $259.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses 
of $55.5 million, or 17.0%, as discussed under “Rental Operating Expenses” below. Same Properties’ tenant recoveries for the year 
ended December 31, 2018, increased by $18.9 million, or 7.6%, primarily due to the increase in recoverable operating expenses for the 
year ended December 31, 2018, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2018, 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net 
leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating 
expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.
Other income
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $12.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively, primarily 
consisting of construction fees earned during each respective year. 
Rental operating expenses
Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $55.5 million, or 17.0%, to $381.1 
million, compared to $325.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $33.6 million of the increase was due to 
an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 2.0 million RSF of development and 
redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2017, and 24 operating properties aggregating 2.4 million RSF  
acquired subsequent to January 1, 2017, of which nine properties have future value-creation opportunities aggregating 3.4 million 
RSF.
Same Properties’ rental operating expenses increased by $21.9 million, or 7.5%, to $314.1 million during the year ended 
December 31, 2018, compared to the $292.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher property taxes as 
a result of incremental property value assessments on recently completed construction at certain properties in California, and increases 
in re-assessed values across various submarkets, including Cambridge, as well as higher payroll, contractual services, and repairs and 
maintenance due to higher occupancy in our same property portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2018.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $15.4 million, or 20.5%, to $90.4 
million, compared to $75.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expenses increased primarily 
due to a 35.4% increase in employees since January 1, 2017, to accommodate the continued growth in the depth and breadth of our 
operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired 
subsequent to January 1, 2017, as discussed under “Rental Operating Expenses” above. As a percentage of net operating income, our 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were 9.6% and 9.3%, respectively.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  86
The net change in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 
2017, resulted from the following (dollars in thousands):
Component Interest Rate(1) Effective Date Change
Increases in interest incurred due to:
Issuances of debt:
$425 million unsecured senior notes payable 4.07% March 2017 $ 2,900

Lower average notional amounts of and rates for interest rate hedge 
agreements in effect (6,880)
Other decrease in interest (192)
Total decreases (16,852)
Change in interest incurred 36,848
Increase in capitalized interest(2) (7,998)
Total change in interest expense $ 28,850
(1)  Represents the interest rate as of the end of the applicable period, plus the effect of debt premiums (discounts), interest rate hedge agreements, and deferred financing costs.
(2)  Increase in capitalized interest is primarily due to an increase in our highly leased development and redevelopment projects undergoing construction in our value-creation pipeline during 
the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was also partially due to the increase in the weighted-average interest rate used for 
capitalization of interest to 4.0% in effect during the year ended December 31, 2018, from 3.9% in effect during the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the increase in rates 
applicable to borrowings outstanding during each respective period.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by $60.9 million, or 14.6%, to 
$477.7 million, compared to $416.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to additional 
depreciation from 2.0 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2017, and 
24 operating properties aggregating 2.4 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2017, of which nine properties have future 
value-creation opportunities aggregating 3.4 million RSF.
Investment income
  Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard on financial instruments. Under the new standard, changes 
in fair value of investments in publicly traded companies and investments in privately held entities that report NAV, and observable 
price changes for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV, are recognized in investment income in our 
consolidated statements of operations. For a detailed discussion related to this new standard, refer to the “Investments” section within 
Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 7 – “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under 
Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

December 31, 2018, primarily consisted of gains aggregating $27.9 million recognized on our publicly traded non-real estate 
investments. Unrealized gains during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisted of observable price increases in our

Rental revenues
Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $189.4 million, or 28.1%, to $863.2 million, 
compared to $673.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues 
from our Non-Same Properties aggregating $172.4 million related to 3.4 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects 
placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2016, and 18 operating properties aggregating 1.7 million RSF acquired subsequent to

$613.9 million, compared to $596.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to significant 
rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2016. The increase was slightly offset by a decrease in 
rental revenue as a result of a decrease in Same Properties’ occupancy to 96.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 97.2% 
for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $35.5 million, or 15.9%, to $259.1 million, compared 
to $223.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is relatively consistent with the increase in our rental operating 
expenses of $47.2 million, or 17.0%, as discussed under “Rental Operating Expenses” below. Same Properties’ tenant recoveries 
increased by $6.7 million, or 3.3%, primarily due to the increase in recoverable operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 
2017, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2017, 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants 
to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases 
thereto) in addition to base rent.
Other income
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, consisted of the following (in thousands):

million, compared to $278.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Approximately $40.3 million of the increase was due to 
an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to development and redevelopment projects 
placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2016, and 18 operating properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2016.
Same Properties rental operating expenses increased by $6.9 million, or 2.9%, to $244.8 million during the year ended 
December 31, 2017, compared to the $238.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to higher repair and 
maintenance expenses as well as higher utility expenses and snow removal services resulting from a comparably colder winter. The 
increase in Same Properties’ rental operating expense was partially offset by property tax refunds during the year ended December 31, 
2017.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $11.1 million, or 17.4%, to 
$75.0 million, compared to $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses increased 
primarily due to the continued growth in depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including a 28.1% increase in total 
rental revenue to $863.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $673.8 million for the same period in 2016, and a 
5.1 million RSF, or 20.7%, increase in our North America asset base subsequent to January 1, 2017. Accordingly, total assets as of 
December 31, 2017, increased by $1.7 billion, or 16.9%, to $12.1 billion from $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. As a percentage 
of total assets, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were consistent at 0.6% for

(2)  Decrease is primarily due to the repayment of four secured notes payable aggregating $270.6 million during 2016.
(3)  Increase in capitalized interest is primarily due to an increase in our highly leased development and redevelopment projects undergoing construction in our value-creation pipeline during 
the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was also partially due to the increase in the weighted-average interest rate used for 
capitalization of interest to 3.9% in effect during the year ended December 31, 2017, from 3.7% in effect during the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the increase in rates 
applicable to borrowings outstanding during each respective period.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $103.4 million, or 33.0%, to 
$416.8 million, compared to $313.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to additional 
depreciation from development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2016, and 18 operating 
properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2016.

Projected results
  Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we present guidance for EPS attributable 
to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted and funds from operations per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders 
– diluted, as adjusted, each for the year ending December 31, 2019, as set forth in the table below. The tables below also provide a

Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures
  We present components of balance sheet and operating results information for the noncontrolling interests’ share of our 
consolidated real estate joint ventures and for our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to help investors 
estimate balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. These amounts are estimated by 
computing, for each joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, the noncontrolling interest percentage of each 
financial item to arrive at the cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented. In addition, for our real estate 
joint ventures that we do not control and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to the unconsolidated real 
estate joint ventures to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.

  We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other 
construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing 
capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases/redemptions of preferred 
stock, and payment of dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint 
venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our $2.2 billion unsecured senior 
line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.
We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, 
generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by 
operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.

97  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:
•  Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling 
interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;
•  Improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;
•  Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, 
secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, preferred stock, 
and common stock;
•  Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•  Maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;
•  Maintain solid credit metrics;
•  Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;
•  Mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate 
bank debt;
•  Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;
•  Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash 
provided by operating activities;
•  Manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; and
•  Maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $272.1 million and $277.2 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and 
restricted cash. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; cash flows from operating activities; proceeds from real 
estate asset sales; non-real estate investment sales; borrowings under our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit; issuances of 
unsecured notes payable; and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash 
commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, 
scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.
Cash flows
We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The 
following table summarizes changes in our cash flows (in thousands):

98
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  98
Operating activities
  Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental 
rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of 
development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. Net cash provided by 
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased to $570.3 million, compared to $450.9 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and 
redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since January 1, 2017, and (iii) increases in 
rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2017.
Investing activities
Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands):

  The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018, is primarily due to an increased use 
of cash for property acquisitions and for investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, partially offset by proceeds from sale 
of investments and an increase in return of capital from our unconsolidated real estate joint venture. Refer to Note 3 – “Investments in

Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,588,433 $ 1,420,341 $ 168,092
Inflation
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to 
pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases 
thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that 
were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. Accordingly, we 
do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. An increase in 
inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our $2.2 
billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and secured construction loan.

The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market 
environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and 
redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and 
uncertainties, including those discussed under Item 1A and within this Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K. We expect to update 
our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.

Sources of capital
Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends
We expect to retain $170.0 million to $210.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common 
stock and preferred stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. For purposes of this calculation, changes in 
operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect 
our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed, along with contributions from 
Same Properties and recently acquired properties, to contribute significant increases in rental revenue, net operating income, and cash 
flows. We anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $42 million related to the commencement of 
contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. Refer to the “Cash 
Flows” section within this Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for 
the year ended December 31, 2018.
Debt
  In February 2018, S&P Global Ratings raised its credit outlook for our corporate credit rating to BBB/Positive from BBB/
Stable. The positive outlook reflects S&P’s belief that “there is further ratings upside over the next couple of years stemming from the 
company’s high quality operating portfolio and projects under development, combined with a prudent financial policy.” 
  In September 2018, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our corporate issuer credit rating to Baa1/Stable from Baa2/Stable. 
The rating upgrade reflects the continued and significant improvement of our credit profile resulting from our diversified portfolio of 
life science properties in key markets with consistently high occupancy and high-quality tenants, many of which are less sensitive to 
economic cyclicality.
 
  On September 28, 2018, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan to extend 
the maturity date of each to January 28, 2024, including two six-month extension options related to our unsecured senior line of credit. 
We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $634 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan 
fees associated with these amendments. The table below reflects the total commitments, outstanding balances, applicable margins, 
maturity dates, and facility fees for each of the following facilities as of as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
Commitment Balance(1) Applicable Rate Maturity Date Facility Fee
Unsecured senior line of credit $2.2 billion $208 million L+0.825% January 2024(2) 0.15%
Unsecured senior bank term loan $350 million $350 million L+0.90% January 2024 N/A
(1)  Excludes amortization of loan fees and amortization of premiums (discounts) as of December 31, 2018.
(2)  Includes two six-month extension options that we control.
  As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured 
senior bank term loan is $208.0 million and $347.4 million, respectively. Borrowings under the $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of 
credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan bear interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the amended agreement plus, in 
either case, a specified margin (the “Applicable Margin”) based on our existing credit ratings as set by certain rating agencies.
  We use our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, 
acquisition of properties. Borrowings under the $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate,” 
a “LIBOR Floating Rate,” or a “Base Rate” specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in 
any case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit 
agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the 
administrative agent and the Company for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), 
(ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) 
the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the 
applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). 
The LIBOR Floating Rate means, for any day, one month LIBOR, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent 
and the Company for loans denominated in U.S. dollars. The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the 
highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to 
time by Bank of America as its “prime rate,” and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%. Our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of 
credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. This may result 
102

Other sources
  Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and 
other securities. These securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, 
including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.
Additionally, we hold interests, together with joint venture partners, in joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial 
statements. These joint venture partners may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for 
construction and financing-related activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $28.3 million in contributions 
from and sales of noncontrolling interests.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  104
Uses of capital
Summary of capital expenditures 
  Our primary use of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. We 
currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 3.9 million RSF of new Class A office/laboratory and tech office space, and 
intermediate-term and future value-creation projects supporting an aggregate of 6.8 million SF of ground-up development in North 
America. We incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction 
activities. We also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly 
related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities 
necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to the “New Class A Development and Redevelopment 
Properties: 2019 Deliveries” and “Summary of Capital Expenditures” sections under Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for 
more information on our capital expenditures.
  We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for 
its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized 
interest for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, of $66.2 million and $58.2 million, respectively, is classified in investments 
in real estate. Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects 
under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its 
intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and 
construction projects which aggregated $32.5 million and $23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively. The increase in capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 
the same period in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our value creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and 
preconstruction activities aggregating 11 projects with 2.6 million RSF in 2018 over 2017. Pre-construction activities include 
entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building 
improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective 
tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction 
of buildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain 
other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed 
as incurred.
  Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total 
expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction 
activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have 
increased by approximately $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
  We also capitalize initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective 
lessee’s financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. Costs that we 
capitalized relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have 
been incurred had that lease transaction not occurred. The initial direct costs capitalized also include the portion of our employees’ 
total compensation and payroll-related benefits directly related to time spent performing the activities described above and related to 
the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our 
total leasing activity aggregated 4.7 million RSF with a weighted-average lease term of 9.1 years and 4.6 million RSF with a 
weighted-average lease term of 7.9 years, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized total 
initial direct leasing costs of $61.4 million, or $1.43 per RSF leased per year of the lease term, and $68.9 million, or $1.91 per RSF 
leased per year of the lease term, respectively, primarily consisting of third-party broker commissions.
The FASB has issued several lease ASUs that set out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and 
disclosure of leases, including the accounting for costs to execute leases effective January 1, 2019. As a result of changes in 
accounting rules, certain initial direct leasing costs will no longer be capitalizable. Refer to the “Lease Accounting” subsection of the 
“Recent Accounting Pronouncements” within Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial 
statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

7.00% Series D cumulative convertible preferred stock repurchases
  As of December 31, 2018, we had 2.6 million shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding. During the 
year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 402,000 shares of our Series D Convertible 
Preferred Stock at an aggregate price of $14.0 million, or $34.77 per share, and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of 
$4.2 million.
  In January 2019, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 275,000 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred 
Stock for $9.2 million, or $33.60 per share, and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $2.6 million. As of January 2019, 
we have 2.3 million shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding.
   We may seek to repurchase additional shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in the future, subject to market 
conditions. To the extent that we repurchase shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, we expect to fund such amounts with 
the proceeds from issuances of our common stock, subject to market conditions.
6.45% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock redemption
  In March 2017, we announced the redemption of our Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock. On April 14, 2017, we completed 
the redemption of all 5.2 million outstanding shares of our Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 per 
share, or an aggregate $130.0 million, plus accrued dividends.
Dividends
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid the following dividends (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2017 Change
Common stock dividends $ 380,632 $ 312,131 $ 68,501
7.00% Series D cumulative convertible preferred stock dividends 5,207 5,426 (219)
6.45% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends — 4,193 (4,193)
$ 385,839 $ 321,750 $ 64,089
 
The increase in dividends paid on our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended 
December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to January 1, 2017, as a 
result of issuances of common stock under our ATM program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to 
the increase in the related dividends to $3.66 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $3.38 per 
common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2017. 
  Dividends paid on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31, 2018, decreased slightly from 
the dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to a decrease in number of shares outstanding as a result of the 
repurchase of 402,000 and 501,115 outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock during the years ended December 
31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in dividends paid on our Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock was due to the 
redemption of all 5.2 million outstanding shares of our Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock on April 14, 2017.

listed under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Estimated interest payments
Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest 
rates, including estimated interest expense related to interest rate hedge agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity 
dates. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate hedge 
agreements. Refer to our interest rate hedge agreements in “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” and “Interest Rate Hedge 
Agreements” in the “Uses of Capital” subsection of the “Sources and Uses of Capital” section within this Item 7 of this annual report 
on Form 10-K for additional information. The remaining 3% of our debt as of December 31, 2018, was unhedged variable-rate debt 
based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect 
as of December 31, 2018. For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt” to 
our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Interest rate hedge agreements
  We utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of our exposure to volatility in variable interest rates primarily 
associated with our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and variable-rate secured 
construction loan. Our derivative instruments consisted of interest rate hedges.
  Our interest rate hedge agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our 
payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional 
amount. Interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is based on one-month LIBOR. The net difference between 
the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
We have entered into master derivative agreements with our counterparties. These master derivative agreements (all of which 
are adapted from the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each of 
our respective counterparties to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. In order to limit 
our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, these agreements are spread 
among various counterparties. The largest aggregate notional amount in effect at any single point in time with an individual 
counterparty in our interest rate hedge agreements existing as of December 31, 2018, was $150.0 million. If one or more of our 
counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate 
LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge 
agreements. 
Ground lease obligations
Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2018, included leases for 29 of our properties, which accounted for 
approximately 12% of our total number of properties. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 
2036 with a net book value of $8.8 million as of December 31, 2018, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging 
from approximately 35 to 96 years, including extension options. Refer to Note 15 – “Commitments and Contingencies” to our 
consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K for further information on our ground leases.
108
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  108
As of December 31, 2018, the remaining contractual payments under our ground and office lease agreements for which we 
are the lessee aggregated $587.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively. Under the new lease ASU effective on January 1, 2019, 
described in detail under the “Lease Accounting” subsection of the “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” within section Note 2 – 
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 
10-K, we are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under our ground 
and office lease arrangements for which we are the lessee. The lease liability will be measured based on the present value of the 
remaining lease payments. The right-of-use asset will be equal to the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing 
cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease. On January 1, 2019, we 
recognized a lease liability of $218.7 million measured based on the present value of the lease payments aggregating $590.3 million 
remaining as of the initial application date of January 1, 2019, under our ground and office lease agreements for which we are the 
lessee. 
Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing 
development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $829.9 million. We expect payments for 
these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability 
to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. We have existing office space 
at 161 First Street/50 Rogers Street in our Alexandria Center® at Kendall Square (“ACKS”) campus that we are required to partially 
convert to multifamily residential space, pursuant to our entitlements for our ACKS campus. Pursuant to these requirements, we 
expect to begin construction of the conversion to multifamily residential in 2019. In addition, we have letters of credit and 
performance obligations aggregating $9.2 million primarily related to construction projects.
  In March 2018, we acquired a 10% interest in a real estate joint venture with Uber Technologies, Inc. and the Golden State 
Warriors that owns 1655 and 1725 Third Street, located in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco. Our total equity 
contribution commitment is $78.0 million, of which we have contributed $32.0 million through December 31, 2018. 
  In November 2017, we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer in the San Francisco Bay Area to own a 49% 
interest in a real estate joint venture at Menlo Gateway in our Greater Stanford submarket of San Francisco. Our total equity 
contribution commitment is $269.0 million, of which we have contributed $177.7 million through December 31, 2018. 
  We are committed to funding approximately $248.3 million for all investments, which primarily consist of $247.8 million 
related to investments in limited partnerships. Our funding commitments expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a 
weighted-average remaining period of 8.8 years. 
 
Exposure to environmental liabilities
In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain 
the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not 
revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of 
operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I 
environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to 
certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

related to the hedged variable-rate debt instrument.
Foreign currency translation
  Changes in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balance relate to changes in the foreign exchange rates for 
our real estate investments in Canada and Asia. Additionally, we reclassify unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses 
into net income as we dispose of these holdings.
Critical accounting policies
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on 
various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
We continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in 
estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our 
stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Our significant accounting 
policies are described in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 
15 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  110
REIT compliance
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of 
highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of 
various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of 
operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to 
qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to 
qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes on our 
taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to 
our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to 
our stockholders.
Investments in real estate
Recognition of real estate acquired
  We evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly 
hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and 
needs to be accounted for as a business combination. An acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the 
definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition.
  For acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the 
acquisition consideration (excluding acquisition costs) to the assets acquired (including the intangible value of acquired above-market 
leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including the intangible value of 
acquired below-market leases and other intangible liabilities), noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership interests at 
fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets 
acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as 
incurred.
  Generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business 
because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, 
buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business 
combinations except that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed on a fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. As a result, 
asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Incremental and external direct acquisition 
costs (such as legal and third party expenses) are capitalized.
We exercise judgment to determine the key assumptions used to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired among its 
components. The allocation of the consideration to the various components of properties acquired during the year can have an effect 
on our net income due to the differing depreciable and amortizable lives of each component and the recognition of the related 
depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We apply judgment in utilizing available 
comparable market information to assess relative fair value. We assess the relative fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on 
numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available 
comparable market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating 
results, known and anticipated trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.
The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an “as if vacant” basis. The value of acquired 
in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in 
the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. The value of above-
market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities reflects the difference between (i) the contractual rents to be paid over the 
remaining term for each in-place lease and (ii) the estimated current market lease rates using available comparable market information 
and tenant credit quality. If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-
place lease, we evaluate intangible factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic 
conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in 
111
111  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain 
purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization 
period. We also recognize the relative fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in 
acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.
We completed the acquisition of 27 properties for a total purchase price of $1.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 
2018. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair value 
of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed.
Depreciation and amortization
The values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and 
building improvements, an estimated life of up to 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, 
and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above- and below-market leases are amortized over the terms of 
the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below-market leases) or a decrease (for above-market leases) to rental 
revenue. The values of acquired above- and below-market ground leases are amortized over the terms of the related ground leases and 
recognized as either an increase (for below-market ground leases) or a decrease (for above-market ground leases) to rental operating 
expense. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the 
remaining terms of the related leases.
Capitalized project costs
We capitalize project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the 
development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, redevelopment, pre-
construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Fluctuations in our 
development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net 
income. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should 
development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other 
costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are 
expensed as incurred.
Properties classified as held for sale
A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, 
having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions 
required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed 
within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and 
(vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that 
the plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
If the disposal of the property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial 
results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major 
parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as 
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from 
continuing operations to discontinued operations. The disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift 
and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations.
Impairment of long-lived assets
On a quarterly basis, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our properties prior to and 
subsequent to the end of each quarter to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an 
impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted 
cash flows for the properties, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
112
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  112
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are 
individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not 
be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the 
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators or triggering 
events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are 
assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term 
lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, 
and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, 
construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic 
conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted 
approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is 
recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the 
recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated 
disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of 
properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
We use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model 
is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if 
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two 
different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment 
charge upon classification as held for sale.
Equity investments
We hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science and
technology industries. As a REIT, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less 
than 10%.
  Our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are 
carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The fair values for our investments in publicly traded 
companies continue to be determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges and therefore generally requires 
no judgment to determine fair value. Investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share, such as our privately held 
investments in limited partnerships, are carried at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient with changes in fair value recognized 
in net income. As a result, fair value estimation for these investments generally requires limited judgment. Investments in privately 
held entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes 
recognized in net income. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed 
during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. For 
these transactions to be considered observable price changes, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and 
obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold. 
  Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV continue to be evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment 
for indicators of impairment. We monitor each of our investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating 
results, results of clinical trials, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, new collaborative 
agreements, capital-raising events, merger and acquisition activities, effect on an investee of changes in overall market conditions. If 
such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss, 
without consideration as to whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in 
excess of its estimated fair value. If there are no identified impairment indicators, we do not estimate the investment’s fair value.

Interest rate hedge agreements
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. 
We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our 
exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage 
economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt 
funding and by entering into interest rate hedge agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage 
exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the values of 
which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and 
duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. Our objectives in using 
interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in 
accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. All of our interest rate hedge agreements are designated as cash flow 
hedges. Interest rate hedge agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a 
counterparty in exchange for the Company’s making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate hedge agreements without 
exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate hedge agreements.
We utilize interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated 
with borrowings based on LIBOR. We classify our interest rate hedge agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at 
fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been 
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative 
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the 
hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate 
hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in 
expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the 
hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. 
All of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our exposure to 
variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the 
method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make a quantitative assessment at the inception of each interest rate 
hedge agreement, and qualitatively on an ongoing basis, to determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting 
changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The entire change in the fair value of our highly effective interest rate hedge 
agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the 
hedged transactions affect earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if our interest rate 
hedges did not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in 
earnings.
The fair value of each interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including 
discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the 
derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied 
volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the 
discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an 
expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation 
also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using “significant unobservable inputs,” such as estimates 
of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of 
our interest rate hedge agreements.
Recognition of rental revenue and tenant recoveries
Rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We classify 
amounts currently recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts expected to be received in 
later years as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently but recognized as revenue in 
future years are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits to our consolidated balance sheets. We 
commence recognition of rental revenue at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of, or 
controls the physical use, of the property.
114
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  114
Rental revenue from direct financing leases is recognized over the respective lease terms using the effective interest rate 
method. At lease inception, we record an asset within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, which represents our net 
investment in the direct financing lease. This initial net investment is determined by aggregating the total future minimum lease 
payments attributable to the direct financing lease and the estimated residual value of the property less unearned income. Over the 
lease term, the investment in the direct financing lease is reduced and rental income is recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated 
statements of operations and produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the direct financing lease.
Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area 
expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and 
the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises.
Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments and tenant recoveries. These tenant 
receivables are expected to be collected within one year. We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the 
inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a tenant fails to make 
contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of 
uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent arising from the straight-lining of rent. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no 
allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent was deemed necessary. Refer to the “Revenue Recognition” section in 
Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report 
on Form 10-K.
Monitoring of tenant credit quality
  During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring 
the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the 
tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news 
reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.

Non-GAAP measures and definitions
This section contains additional information of certain non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons why we use these 
supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other 
terms used in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common 
stockholders
  GAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish 
over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the 
Nareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from 
operations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is 
helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, 
as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, 
without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, 
capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. 
We compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the Nareit Board of Governors in its April 2002 White 
Paper and related implementation guidance (the “Nareit White Paper”). The Nareit White Paper defines funds from operations as net 
income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels, and 
impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after 
adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the 
write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market 
conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. The definition 
of funds from operations in the Nareit White Paper does not include adjustments related to unrealized gains and losses on non-real 
estate investments, which reflect market conditions outside of our control. Consequently, unrealized gains and losses on non-real 
estate investments recognized in earnings are included in reported funds from operations as computed in accordance with the Nareit 
White Paper.
  We compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White 
Paper excluding significant realized gains or losses on the sale of non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real 
estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of non-
depreciable real estate, impairments of non-real estate investments, deal costs, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our 
unvested restricted stock awards. Neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as 
alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from 
operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds 
for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.
  In November 2018, Nareit issued a restated white paper to incorporate its April 2002 White Paper and subsequent guidance 
into a single comprehensive guide. We adopted prospectively Nareit’s restated white paper on January 1, 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
  We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-
making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is 
calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), excluding stock compensation expense, 
gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate and land parcels, and impairments of real estate 
and land parcels. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses, and significant realized gains and impairments, that 
result from our non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our statement of operations 
outside of revenues. 
  We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the 
operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real 
estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting 
from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of 
debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We believe that adjusting for 
the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, and significant impairments and significant gains on the sale of non-
real estate investments allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account 
for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real estate investment and disposition decisions. We believe that excluding 
charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across 
periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our 
performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual 
commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net (loss) income or cash flows from 
118
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  118
operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in 
evaluating performance or liquidity.
  Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, divides Adjusted EBITDA by our revenues, as adjusted. We believe that revenues, 
as adjusted provides a denominator for Adjusted EBITDA margin which is calculated on a basis more consistent with that of the Adjusted 
EBITDA numerator. Specifically, revenues, as adjusted includes the same realized gains on, and impairments of, non-real estate 
investments that are included in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the consistent application of results from our 
non-real estate investments to both the numerator and denominator of Adjusted EBITDA margins provide a more useful calculation for 
the comparison across periods.

Annual rental revenue
 
Annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental amount, in effect as of the end of the period, related to our 
operating RSF. Annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our 
share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Annual rental revenue per RSF is computed by 
dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of the RSF of properties 
held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were 
triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other 
operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses 
recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses are classified in tenant recoveries 
in our consolidated statements of operations.
Cash interest
Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of 
loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). See definition of fixed-charge coverage ratio for a reconciliation of interest expense, the 
most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest.
Class A properties and AAA locations
 
  Class A properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and 
collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, 
efficiency, creativity, and success. Class A properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar 
properties.
 
  AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. 
Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited 
supply of available space. 
Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction
  A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new 
Class A properties located in collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are 
generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable 
by, a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental 
income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly 
desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher 
returns, and greater long-term asset value.
  Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment 
projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory or tech office space. We 
generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A office/laboratory and tech office 
space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A 
properties. 
  Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement 
of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time 
required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and 
are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to 
generate significant revenue and cash flows.

Fixed-charge coverage ratio
  Fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges. 
We believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred 
stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less 
amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). 
  The following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in 
accordance with GAAP, to cash interest and fixed charges (dollars in thousands):
Three Months Ended December 31,
2018 2017
Adjusted EBITDA $ 242,222 $ 204,348
Interest expense $ 40,239 $ 36,082

Dividends on preferred stock 1,155 1,302
Fixed charges $ 59,506 $ 48,349
Fixed-charge coverage ratio:
– period annualized 4.1x 4.2x
– trailing 12 months 4.2x 4.1x
Initial stabilized yield (unlevered)
  Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization and our 
investment in the property. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation 
projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized 
yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the 
project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected 
project yields or costs.
•  Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the 
term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.
•  Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have 
elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.
Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants
  Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded 
companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, as 
reported by Bloomberg Professional Services. In addition, we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. 
Material changes that cause a tenant’s market capitalization to decline below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the 
12-month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

Joint venture financial information
  We present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our joint ventures, which are not 
presented in accordance with, or intended to be presented in accordance with, GAAP. We present the proportionate share of certain 
financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, but of which we 
own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the 
amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that 
we do not control, and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our 
proportionate share of each component presented. 
  The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures do not represent our legal claim 
to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can 
receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally entitled to their 
respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have 
been repaid or satisfied. 
  We believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our 
partially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial 
statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our 
consolidated results.
  The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool 
as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, or results 
of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real 
estate joint ventures that we do not control. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures” to our 
consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our unconsolidated real 
estate joint ventures. 
  We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and 
liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and 
balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, 
which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends
  Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. 
For purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. 
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that 
we believe are useful to investors as supplemental measures in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt is equal to the sum of 
total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of net debt, as 
discussed above, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. Refer to “Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
Margin” within this section of this Item 7 for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

Operating margin 71% 71% 70%
 
  Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income (loss), the most directly comparable 
financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real 
estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of real estate, 
gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. We believe net 
operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it 
primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is 
a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a 
cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-
market lease revenue adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an 
additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- 
and below-market leases.
  Furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure for our consolidated properties 
because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, 
which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the 
initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating the quotient of net operating income generated by a property on a straight-line 
basis and our investment in the property. Net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide 
results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily 
linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In 
addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of 
operating performance at the property level. Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because 
we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in 
the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our 
impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These 
impairments result from investing decisions and deterioration in market conditions. We also exclude investment income or loss 
calculated under a new ASU effective January 1, 2018. Investment income or loss represent changes in fair values of our equity 
124
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  124
investments resulting from volatility of market conditions outside of our control. Therefore, we do not consider investment income or 
loss to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. Our calculation of net operating income 
also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these 
charges often relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist 
of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; 
contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General 
and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office 
rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We calculate operating margin as net operating 
income divided by total revenues. 
  We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should 
be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income 
should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows 
as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.
Operating statistics
  We present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, 
leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors because 
they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, 
leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties 
owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to 
“Annual Rental Revenue” herein. 
Same property comparisons
As a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from 
assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently 
placed into service, the consolidated total rental revenues, tenant recoveries, and rental operating expenses in our operating results can 
show significant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given 
quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the 
entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same 
property results to align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management’s discussion and analysis of 
our financial condition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent 
to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or 
redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for 
sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property 
results. Additionally, lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties.
Stabilized occupancy date
  The stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or 
greater.
Total market capitalization
  Total market capitalization is equal to the sum of total equity market capitalization and total debt. Total equity market 
capitalization is equal to the sum of outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and common stock multiplied by the 
related closing price of each class of security at the end of each period presented.
Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income
 
Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we 
believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it reflects 
those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is derived 
from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as 
of the period for which income is presented.

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted
  We enter into capital market transactions from time to time to fund acquisitions, fund construction of our highly leased 
development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. In March 2017 and January 2018, we entered into 
forward equity sales agreements to sell shares of our common stock. We are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our 
forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. We also 
consider the effect of assumed conversion of our outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock when determining potentially 
dilutive incremental shares to our common stock. When calculating the assumed conversion, we add back to net income or loss the 
dividends paid on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to the numerator and then include additional common shares assumed to 
have been issued (as displayed in the table below) to the denominator of the per share calculation. The effect of the assumed 
conversion is considered separately for our per share calculations of net income or loss; funds from operations, computed in 
accordance with the definition in the Nareit White Paper; and funds from operations, as adjusted. Our Series D Convertible Preferred 
Stock is dilutive and assumed to be converted when annual basic EPS, funds from operations, or funds from operations, as adjusted 
exceeds approximately $7.00 per share, subject to conversion ratio adjustments and the impact of repurchases of our 7.00% Series D 
cumulative convertible preferred stock. The effect of the assumed conversion is included when it is dilutive on a per share basis. The 
dilutive effect to both numerator and denominator may result in a per share effect of less than a half cent, which would appear as zero 
in our per share calculation, even when the dilutive effect to the numerator alone appears in our reconciliation. Refer to Note 13 – 
“Earnings per Share” and Note 16 – “Stockholders’ Equity” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this annual 
report on Form 10-K for more information related to our forward equity sales agreements and our Series D Convertible Preferred 
Stock. 
  The weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating EPS – diluted, funds from operations per 
share – diluted, and funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, during each period is calculated as follows (in thousands):

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest rate risk
The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, 
including government monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors 
that are beyond our control.
In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate 
risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, caps, floors, and 
other interest rate exchange contracts. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest 
rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts.
Our future earnings and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of 
interest, such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate hedge agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate fluctuations. 
The following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in interest rates on our variable-rate debt, including our $2.2 billion unsecured 
senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and secured construction loan, after considering the effect of our interest rate 
hedge agreements, secured debt, and unsecured senior notes payable as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):
Annualized effect on future earnings due to variable-rate debt:
Rate increase of 1% $ (2,524)
Rate decrease of 1% $ 2,524
Effect on fair value of total consolidated debt and interest rate hedge agreements:
Rate increase of 1% $ (237,413)
Rate decrease of 1% $ 254,960
These amounts are determined by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our 
interest rate hedge agreements in existence on December 31, 2018. These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of 
overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Furthermore, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would 
consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. Because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be 
taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in our capital structure.
Equity price risk
We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in publicly traded companies and privately 
held entities. All of our investments in actively traded public companies are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
Our investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share are measured at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient to 
fair value. Our equity investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost less impairments, adjusted for 
observable price changes during the period. Changes in fair value of public investments, changes in NAV reported by privately held 
entities, and observable price changes of privately held entities that do not report NAV are recognized as investment income in our 
consolidated statements of operations. There is no assurance that future declines in value will not have a material adverse effect on our 
future results of operations. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% change in the value of our equity investments would 
have on earnings as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):
Equity price risk:
Fair value increase of 10% $ 89,226
Fair value decrease of 10% $ (89,226)
127
127  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our subsidiaries operating in Canada and Asia. The 
functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies in each respective country. Gains or losses resulting from the 
translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets and statements of operations are classified in accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss) as a separate component of total equity and are excluded from net income (loss). Gains or losses will be reflected in our 
consolidated statements of operations when there is a sale or partial sale of our investment in these operations or upon a complete or 
substantially complete liquidation of the investment. The following table illustrates the effect that a 10% change in foreign currency 
rates relative to the U.S. dollar would have on our potential future earnings and on the fair value of our net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries based on our current operating assets outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):
Effect on potential future earnings due to foreign currency exchange rate:
Rate increase of 10% $ 82
Rate decrease of 10% $ (82)
Effect on the fair value of net investment in foreign subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate:
Rate increase of 10% $ 9,658
Rate decrease of 10% $ (9,658)
This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the U.S. dollar; 
however, foreign currency exchange rates do not typically move in such a manner, and actual results may differ materially.
Our exposure to market risk elements for the year ended December 31, 2018, was consistent with the risk elements presented 
above, including the effects of changes in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
As of December 31, 2018, we had performed an evaluation, under the supervision of our Co-Chief Executive Officers 
(“CEOs”) and our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 
procedures. These controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that information required for disclosure is recorded, 
processed, summarized, and reported within the requisite time periods. Based on our evaluation, the Co-CEOs and the CFO concluded 
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 
2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in 
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a process designed by, or 
under the supervision of, the Co-CEOs and the CFO and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and other 
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance 
with the authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2018 and 2017. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations (“COSO 2013”) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 framework). 
Management concluded that based on its assessment, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by 
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the Company) maintained, 
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated 
statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests and cash flows for each 
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and schedule, and our report dated February 5, 2019, 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment 
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal 
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the 
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect 
on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the Company), as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ 
equity and noncontrolling interests and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related 
notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial 
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the 
Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) and our report dated February 5, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
As discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain 
equity investments in the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to 
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence 
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP
We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.  Organization and basis of presentation
  Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), an S&P 500® company, is an urban office REIT uniquely focused on 
collaborative life science and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, 
references to the “Company,” “Alexandria,” “ARE,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its 
consolidated subsidiaries. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real Estate 
Equities, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain 
prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-period presentation. Refer to the discussion on “Restricted 
Cash” under the “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” section of Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our 
consolidated financial statements.
  Any references to our market capitalization, number or quality of buildings or tenants, quality of location, square footage, 
number of leases, or occupancy percentage, and any amounts derived from these values in these notes to consolidated financial 
statements are unaudited.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies
Consolidation
On an ongoing basis, as circumstances indicate the need for reconsideration, we evaluate each legal entity that is not wholly 
owned by us in accordance with the consolidation guidance. Our evaluation considers all of our variable interests, including equity 
ownership, as well as fees paid to us for our involvement in the management of each partially owned entity. To fall within the scope of 
the consolidation guidance, an entity must meet both of the following criteria:
•  The entity has a legal structure that has been established to conduct business activities and to hold assets; such entity can 
be in the form of a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, among others; and
•  We have a variable interest in the legal entity – i.e., variable interests that are contractual, such as equity ownership, or 
other financial interests that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets.
If an entity does not meet both criteria above, we apply other accounting literature, such as the cost or equity method of 
accounting. If an entity does meet both criteria above, we evaluate such entity for consolidation under either the variable interest 
model if the legal entity meets any of the following characteristics to qualify as a VIE, or under the voting model for all other legal 
entities that are not VIEs.
A legal entity is determined to be a VIE if it has any of the following three characteristics:
1)  The entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support;
2)  The entity is established with non-substantive voting rights (i.e., where the entity deprives the majority economic interest 
holder(s) of voting rights); or
3)  The equity holders, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Equity holders meet this 
criterion if they lack any of the following:
•  The power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly 
influence the entity’s economic performance, as evidenced by:
•  Substantive participating rights in day-to-day management of the entity’s activities; or
•  Substantive kick-out rights over the party responsible for significant decisions;
•  The obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses; or
•  The right to receive the entity’s expected residual returns.
F-9
F-9  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
  Once we consider the sufficiency of equity and voting rights of each legal entity, we then evaluate the characteristics of the 
equity holders’ interests, as a group, to see if they qualify as controlling financial interests. Our real estate joint ventures consist of 
limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For an entity structured as a limited partnership or a limited liability company, our 
evaluation of whether the equity holders (equity partners other than us in each of our joint ventures) lack the characteristics of a 
controlling financial interest includes the evaluation of whether the limited partners or non-managing members (the noncontrolling 
equity holders) lack both substantive participating rights and substantive kick-out rights, defined as follows:
•  Participating rights provide the noncontrolling equity holders the ability to direct significant financial and operating 
decisions made in the ordinary course of business that most significantly influence the entity’s economic performance.
•  Kick-out rights allow the noncontrolling equity holders to remove the general partner or managing member without cause.
If we conclude that any of the three characteristics of a VIE are met, including that the equity holders lack the characteristics 
of a controlling financial interest because they lack both substantive participating rights and substantive kick-out rights, we conclude 
that the entity is a VIE and evaluate it for consolidation under the variable interest model.
Variable interest model
If an entity is determined to be a VIE, we evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary analysis 
is a qualitative analysis based on power and benefits. We consolidate a VIE if we have both power and benefits – that is, (i) we have 
the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly influence the VIE’s economic performance (power), and (ii) we have 
the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE 
(benefits). We consolidate VIEs whenever we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and 
Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures” to our consolidated financial statements for information on specific joint ventures that 
qualify as VIEs. If we have a variable interest in a VIE but are not the primary beneficiary, we account for our investment using the 
equity method of accounting.
Voting model
If a legal entity fails to meet any of the three characteristics of a VIE (due to insufficiency of equity, existence of non-
substantive voting rights, or lack of a controlling financial interest), we then evaluate such entity under the voting model. Under the 
voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting shares and 
that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and Unconsolidated Real Estate 
Joint Ventures” to our consolidated financial statements for further information on one of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 
that qualify for evaluation under the voting model.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and equity; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the 
date of the consolidated financial statements; and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
could materially differ from those estimates.
Reportable segment
We are engaged in the business of providing space for lease to the life science and technology industries. Our properties are 
similar in that they provide space for lease to the life science and technology industries, consist of improvements that are generic and 
reusable for the life science and technology industries, are primarily located in AAA urban innovation cluster locations, and have 
similar economic characteristics. Our chief operating decision makers review financial information for our entire consolidated 
operations when making decisions related to assessing our operating performance, and reviews financial information for our 
individual properties when determining how to allocate resources related to capital expenditures. We have aggregated the properties 
into one reportable segment as the properties share similar long-term economic characteristics and have other similarities, including 
the fact that they are operated using consistent business strategies, are typically located in major metropolitan areas, and have similar 
tenant mixes. The financial information disclosed herein represents all of the financial information related to our one reportable 
segment.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Investments in real estate
Evaluation of business combination or asset acquisition
  We evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly 
hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and 
needs to be accounted for as a business combination. An acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the 
definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If either of the following criteria is met, the integrated set of assets and 
activities acquired would not qualify as a business:
•  Substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or a 
group of similar identifiable assets; or
•  The integrated set of assets and activities is lacking, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together 
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs (i.e., revenue generated before and after the transaction).
An acquired process is considered substantive if:
•  The process includes an organized workforce (or includes an acquired contract that provides access to an organized 
workforce) that is skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced in performing the process;
•  The process cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay; or
•  The process is considered unique or scarce.
Generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business 
because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, 
buildings, and related intangible assets) or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired 
workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay. When evaluating acquired service 
or management contracts, we consider the nature of the services performed, the terms of the contract relative to similar arm’s-length 
contracts, and the availability of comparable vendors in evaluating whether the acquired contract constitutes a substantive process.
Recognition of real estate acquired
For acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we recognize the 
assets acquired (including the intangible value of acquired above- or below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant 
relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership 
interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net 
assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed 
as incurred.
Acquisitions of real estate and in-substance real estate that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset 
acquisitions. The accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business combinations except that the 
acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a 
relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the assets acquired or 
liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets or liabilities based on their relative fair value. As a result, asset acquisitions do 
not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Additionally, because the accounting model for asset acquisitions 
is a cost accumulation model, preexisting interests in the acquired assets, if any, are not remeasured to fair value but continue to be 
accounted for at their historical cost. Incremental and external direct acquisition costs (such as legal and third party expenses) are 
capitalized if an asset acquisition is probable. If we determine that an asset acquisition is no longer probable, no new costs are 
capitalized and all capitalized costs that are not recoverable are expensed. 
The relative fair values used to allocate the cost of an asset acquisition are determined by the same methodologies and 
assumptions we utilize to determine fair value in a business combination.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
If a real estate property is acquired with an in-place lease that contains a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period 
beyond the non-cancelable lease term, we evaluate factors, such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, 
the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease its space during the 
renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that 
such bargain renewal option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related 
amortization period. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of fair value on an “as if vacant” basis. The 
value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have 
been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We 
assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize 
appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number 
of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions, that may affect the property.
The values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease, estimated useful life or up to 40 years 
for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of up to 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term or 
estimated useful life for tenant improvements, and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life for equipment. The values of 
acquired above- and below-market leases are amortized over the terms of the related leases and recognized as either increases (for 
below-market leases) or decreases (for above-market leases) to rental revenue. The values of acquired above- and below-market 
ground leases are amortized over the terms of the related ground leases and recognized as either increases (for below-market ground 
leases) or decreases (for above-market ground leases) to rental operating expense. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified 
in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases.
Capitalized project costs
We capitalize project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly 
related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, 
redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended 
use. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes 
to total expenses and net income. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as 
incurred. Should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and 
certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and 
maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Real estate sales
A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, 
having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions 
required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed 
within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and 
(vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that 
the plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.
If the disposal of a property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial 
results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major 
parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as 
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from 
continuing operations to discontinued operations. The disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift 
and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.
Impairment of long-lived assets
On a quarterly basis, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our properties prior to and 
subsequent to the end of each quarter to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an 
impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted 
cash flows for the properties, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.
F-12
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  F-12
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are 
individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not 
be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the 
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators or triggering 
events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are 
assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term 
lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, 
and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, 
construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic 
conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted 
approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is 
recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the 
recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated 
disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of 
properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.
We use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model 
is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if 
the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two 
different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment 
charge upon classification as held for sale.
Cash and cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash 
equivalents. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks in accounts that may at times exceed 
the FDIC-insured limit of $250,000. We have not experienced any losses to date on our invested cash.
International operations
In addition to operating properties in the U.S., we have three operating properties in Canada and one operating property in 
China. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the U.S. is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies for our foreign 
subsidiaries are the local currencies in each respective country. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into 
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. Income statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are 
translated using the weighted-average exchange rate for the periods presented. Gains or losses resulting from the translation are 
classified in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of total equity and are excluded from net income.
Whenever a foreign investment meets the criteria for classification as held for sale, we evaluate the recoverability of the 
investment under the held for sale impairment model. We may recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of the 
investment exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. In determining an investment’s carrying amount, we consider its net book value and 
any cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment related to the investment.
The appropriate amounts of foreign exchange rate gains or losses classified in accumulated other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to net income when realized upon the sale of our investment or upon the complete or substantially complete liquidation of 
our investment.
Investments
We hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science and 
technology industries. As a REIT, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 
10%.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Prior to January 1, 2018
  Prior to the adoption of a new ASU on financial instruments effective January 1, 2018, all of our equity investments in 
actively traded public companies were considered available-for-sale and were presented in our consolidated balance sheets at fair 
value. Fair value was determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as 
a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within total equity (excluded from net income). The classification 
of each investment was determined at the time each investment was made, and such determination was reevaluated at each balance 
sheet date. The cost of each investment sold was determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses 
classified in other income in our consolidated statements of operations. Investments in privately held entities were generally accounted 
for under the cost method when our interest in the entity was so minor that we had virtually no influence over the entity’s operating 
and financial policies, otherwise investment in privately held entities were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method of accounting, we recognized our investment initially at cost and adjusted the carrying amount of the 
investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.
  We periodically assessed our investments in available-for-sale equity securities and privately held companies accounted for 
under the cost method for other-than-temporary impairment. We monitored each of our investments throughout the year for new 
developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. 
Individual investments were evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions indicated an impairment may exist. The factors that 
we considered in making these assessments included, but were not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, 
prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If an unrealized 
loss related to an available-for-sale equity security was determined to be other-than-temporary, such unrealized loss was reclassified 
from accumulated other comprehensive income within total equity into earnings. For a cost method investment, if a decline in the fair 
value of an investment below its carrying value was determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment was written down to its 
estimated fair value with a charge to earnings. If there were no identified events or changes in circumstances that might have had an 
adverse effect on our cost method investments, we did not estimate the investment’s fair value.
Effective January 1, 2018
  Beginning on January 1, 2018, under the new ASU, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method 
and those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income, 
as follows:
•  Investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values. These 
investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income, rather than in accumulated 
other comprehensive income within total equity. The fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies 
continue to be determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges.
•  Investments in privately held entities without readily determinable fair values fall into two categories:
•  Investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share, such as our privately held investments in limited 
partnerships, are carried at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient with changes in fair value recognized in net 
income. We use NAV reported by limited partnerships without adjustment, unless we are aware of information 
indicating that the NAV reported by a limited partnership does not accurately reflect the fair value of the investment 
at our reporting date. 
•  Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV are accounted for using a measurement alternative that 
measure these investments at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized 
in net income.
  For investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV, an observable price is a price observed in an orderly 
transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity 
transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity 
transactions related to the same issuer. For these transactions to be considered observable price changes of the same issuer, we 
evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion 
rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
  Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV continue to be evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment 
for indicators of impairment by utilizing the same monitoring criteria described above and monitoring the presence of the following 
impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; 
(ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse 
change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products, which the investee is 
bringing or attempting to bring to the market, or (iv) significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss, 
without consideration as to whether the impairment is other-than-temporary, in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in 
excess of its estimated fair value.
 
  Investments in privately held entities continue to be accounted for under the equity method unless our interest in the entity is 
deemed to be so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies. Under the equity method 
of accounting, we initially recognize our investment at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of 
the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.
Initial adoption of new ASU
  On January 1, 2018, we recognized the following adjustments upon adoption of the new ASU:
•  For investments in publicly traded companies, reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains as of December 31, 2017, 
aggregating $49.8 million, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
•  For investments in privately held entities without readily determinable fair values that were previously accounted for 
under the cost method:
•  Adjustment to investments for unrealized gains aggregating $90.8 million related to investments in privately held 
entities that report NAV, representing the difference between fair value as of December 31, 2017, using NAV as a 
practical expedient and the carrying value of the investments as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding 
adjustment to retained earnings.
•  No required adjustment for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. The ASU requires a 
prospective transition approach for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. The FASB clarified 
that it would be difficult for entities to determine the last observable transaction price existing prior to the adoption 
of this ASU. Therefore, unlike our investments in privately held entities that report NAV that were adjusted to reflect 
fair values upon adoption of the new ASU, our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV were 
not included in the cumulative adjustment recorded on January 1, 2018 to adjust fair values upon adoption. As such, 
any initial valuation adjustments made for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV subsequent 
to January 1, 2018, as a result of future observable price changes include recognition of unrealized gains or losses 
equal to the difference between the carrying basis of the investment and the observable price at the date of 
remeasurement.
  Beginning January 1, 2018, we recognize unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses within investment income 
in our consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses represent changes in fair value for investments in publicly 
traded companies, changes in NAV, as a practical expedient to estimate fair value, for investments in privately held entities that report 
NAV, and observable price changes on our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. Impairments are realized 
losses, which result in an adjusted cost, and represent charges to reduce the carrying values of investments in privately held entities 
that do not report NAV to their estimated fair value. Realized gains and losses represent the difference between proceeds received 
upon disposition of investments and their historical or adjusted cost.
Revenue recognition
Recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers
 
  On January 1, 2018, we adopted an ASU on revenue recognition that requires a new model for recognition of revenue arising 
from contracts with customers, as well as recognition of gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets arising from 
contracts with noncustomers. A customer is distinguished from a noncustomer by the nature of the goods or services that are 
transferred. Customers are provided with goods or services that are generated by a company’s ordinary output activities, whereas 
noncustomers are provided with nonfinancial assets that are outside of a company’s ordinary output activities.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
  The core principle underlying the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers is that an entity must 
recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
entity expects to be entitled in such exchange. This requires entities to identify contractual performance obligations and determine 
whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a 
customer. The ASU requires the use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model 
requires that we (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the 
transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) 
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the 
performance obligation.
  An entity is also required to determine if it controls the goods or services prior to the transfer to the customer in order to 
determine whether it should account for the arrangement as a principal or an agent. Principal arrangements, where the entity controls 
the goods or services provided, result in the recognition of the gross amount of consideration expected in the exchange. Agent 
arrangements, where the entity simply arranges but does not control the goods or services being transferred to the customer, result in 
the recognition of the net amount the entity is entitled to retain in the exchange. 
  Entities had the option to transition to the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers using either 
the full retrospective or the modified retrospective method. We adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method, which 
required a cumulative adjustment for the effects of applying the new standard to periods prior to 2018 to be recorded in retained 
earnings as of January 1, 2018. We also elected to apply this ASU only to contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018. For all 
contracts within the scope of this ASU that were not completed as of January 1, 2018, we evaluated the revenue recognition under 
accounting standards in effect prior to January 1, 2018, and under the new ASU, and determined that amounts recognized and the 
pattern of revenue recognition were consistent. Therefore, the adoption of the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts 
with customers did not result in an cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018.
  The table below provides the detail of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, by (i) revenues that 
are subject to the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers, and (ii) revenues subject to lease accounting 
and other accounting standards (in thousands):
Date of ASU Year Ended
Adoption December 31, 2018
Revenues subject to the lease ASU:
Rental revenues 1/1/19 $ 963,554
Tenant recoveries 1/1/19 304,063
1,267,617
Revenues subject to the revenue recognition ASU:
Parking and other revenues 1/1/18 47,164
Other income 1/1/18 9,914
57,078
Interest and other income within the scope of other existing accounting standards N/A 2,764
Total revenues $ 1,327,459
  Parking revenues subject to the new revenue recognition ASU aggregating $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 
2018, and classified in rental revenues in our consolidated statements of operations, consist primarily of short-term rental revenues 
that are not considered lease revenue under the new ASU. Under accounting standards that were in effect prior to January 1, 2018, we 
recognized parking and other revenue when the amounts were fixed or determinable, collectibility was reasonably assured, and 
services were rendered. Under the new ASU, the recognition of such revenue occurs when the services are provided and the 
performance obligations are satisfied. Parking services are normally provided at a point in time; therefore, revenue recognition under 
the new ASU is substantially similar to the recognition pattern under accounting standards that were in effect prior to January 1, 2018.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
  Other income, subject to the new revenue recognition ASU aggregating $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, 
consists primarily of construction management fees. We earn construction management fees for the day-to-day management of third-
party construction projects. Construction management services represent a series of services that are substantially the same and that 
can be combined into a single performance obligation. Under accounting standards in effect prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized 
construction management fees using the percentage of completion method. Under the new ASU, we recognize construction 
management fees using the output method, which is substantially similar to the percentage of completion method used under the 
accounting standards in effect prior to January 1, 2018. 
  In addition to the analysis above, we evaluated the following qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements outlined in 
this ASU during the year ended December 31, 2018, as follows:
•  We reviewed our contracts prior to the adoption of this ASU and noted that we did not have material contract assets or 
contract liabilities related to contracts with customers subject to the new revenue recognition ASU. Consequently, upon 
adoption of this ASU, we did not recognize any such assets or liabilities. 
•  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had no contract assets or contract liabilities related to contracts with 
customers subject to the new revenue recognition ASU that would require the recognition in our consolidated balance 
sheets. 
•  Parking and construction management services subject to the new revenue recognition ASU do not normally create 
obligations for returns, refunds, warranties, and other similar obligations. Therefore, no corresponding disclosures were 
necessary.
Recognition of revenue arising from contracts with noncustomers
  On January 1, 2018, we also adopted a new ASU on the derecognition of nonfinancial assets in transactions, including real 
estate sales, with noncustomers. Our ordinary output activities consist of the leasing of space to our tenants in our operating properties, 
not the sales of real estate. Therefore, sales of real estate qualify as contracts with noncustomers and are subject to this new ASU.
  The new ASU on the derecognition of nonfinancial assets requires entities to apply certain recognition and measurement 
principles consistent with the new ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. The derecognition model is 
based on the transfer of control. If a real estate sales contract includes ongoing involvement by the seller with the property, the seller 
must evaluate each promised good or service under the contract to determine whether it represents a separate performance obligation, 
constitutes a guarantee, or prevents the transfer of control. If a good or service is considered a separate performance obligation, an 
allocated portion of the transaction price should be recognized as revenue as the entity transfers the related good or service to the 
buyer.
  The recognition of gain or loss on the sale of a partial interest also depends on whether the seller retains a controlling or 
noncontrolling interest. Under the new standards, a partial sale of real estate in which the seller retains a controlling interest results in 
the seller’s continuing to reflect the asset at its current book value, recording a noncontrolling interest for the book value of the partial 
interest sold, and recognizing additional paid-in capital for the difference between the consideration received and the partial interest at 
book value, consistent with the prior accounting standards. Conversely, a partial sale of real estate in which a seller retains a 
noncontrolling interest results in the recognition by the seller of a gain or loss as if 100% of the real estate were sold.
  We adopted the new ASU on the derecognition of nonfinancial assets using the modified retrospective method, the same 
transition method used to adopt the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. We also elected to apply 
this ASU on the derecognition of nonfinancial assets only to contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018. We had no contracts with 
noncustomers that were not completed as of January 1, 2018; therefore, the adoption of the ASU on the derecognition of nonfinancial 
assets had no effect on our consolidated financial statements on the date of adoption.
Recognition of rental revenue and tenant recoveries
Rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We classify 
amounts currently recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts expected to be received in 
later years as deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently but recognized as revenue in future years 
are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. We commence 
recognition of rental revenue at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of, or controls the 
physical use, of the property.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Rental revenue from direct financing leases is recognized over the respective lease terms using the effective interest rate 
method. At lease inception, we record an asset within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, which represents our net 
investment in the direct financing lease. This initial net investment is determined by aggregating the total future minimum lease 
payments attributable to the direct financing lease and the estimated residual value of the property less unearned income. Over the 
lease term, the investment in the direct financing lease is reduced and rental income is recognized as rental revenue in our consolidated 
statements of operations and produces a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the direct financing lease. Refer to 
Note 8 – “Other Assets” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our direct financing lease. 
Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area 
expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and 
the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises. Refer to the “Lease Accounting” subsection within the “Recent Accounting 
Pronouncements” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. 
Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments and tenant recoveries. These tenant 
receivables are expected to be collected within one year. We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the 
inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a tenant fails to make 
contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of 
uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent arising from the straight-lining of rent. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no 
allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables and deferred rent was deemed necessary.
Monitoring of tenant credit quality
  During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring 
the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the 
tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news 
reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.
Income taxes
We are organized and operate as a REIT pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). Under the Code, a REIT that 
distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders annually (excluding net capital gains) and meets certain other 
conditions is not subject to federal income tax on its distributed taxable income, but could be subject to certain federal, foreign, state, 
and local taxes. We distribute 100% of our taxable income annually; therefore, a provision for federal income taxes is not required. In 
addition to our REIT returns, we file federal, foreign, state, and local tax returns for our subsidiaries. We file with jurisdictions located 
in the U.S., Canada, India, China, and other international locations. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination in various 
jurisdictions for the 2013 through 2017 calendar years.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed a tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into 
law. The tax reform legislation is a far-reaching and complex revision to the U.S. federal income tax laws with disparate and, in some 
cases, countervailing effects on different categories of taxpayers and industries. The legislation is unclear in many respects and will 
require clarification and interpretation by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS in the form of amendments, technical corrections, 
regulations, or other forms of guidance, any of which could either lessen or increase the effect of the legislation on us or our 
stockholders. The outcome of this legislation on state and local tax authorities, and the response by such authorities, is also unclear. 
We continue to monitor changes made to, or as a result of, the federal tax law and its potential effect on us.
Loan fees
Fees incurred in obtaining long-term financing are capitalized and classified with the corresponding debt instrument 
appearing on our consolidated balance sheet. Loan fees related to our unsecured senior line of credit are classified within other assets. 
Capitalized amounts are amortized over the term of the related loan, and the amortization is classified in interest expense in our 
consolidated statements of operations.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Interest rate hedge agreements
We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes, and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. 
We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our 
exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage 
economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt 
funding and by entering into interest rate hedge agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage 
exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the values of 
which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and 
duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. Our objectives in using 
interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in 
accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. All of our interest rate hedge agreements are designated as cash flow 
hedges. Interest rate hedge agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a 
counterparty in exchange for the Company’s making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate hedge agreements without 
exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate hedge agreements.
 
  We utilize interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated 
with borrowings based on LIBOR. We classify our interest rate hedge agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at 
fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been 
designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative 
instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the 
hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate 
hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in 
expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the 
hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. 
  All of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our exposure to 
variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the 
method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make a quantitative assessment at the inception of each interest rate 
hedge agreement, and qualitatively on an ongoing basis, to determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting 
changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The entire change in the fair value of our highly effective interest rate hedge 
agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the 
hedged transactions affect earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if our interest rate 
hedges did not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in 
earnings.
The fair value of each interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including 
discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the 
derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied 
volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the 
discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an 
expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation 
also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using “significant unobservable inputs,” such as estimates 
of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of 
our interest rate hedge agreements.
Employee and non-employee share-based payments
  We have implemented an entity-wide accounting policy to account for forfeitures of share-based awards granted to 
employees and non-employees when they occur. As a result of this policy, we recognize expense on share-based awards with time-
based vesting conditions without reductions for an estimate of forfeitures. This accounting policy only applies to service condition 
awards. For performance condition awards, we continue to assess the probability that such conditions will be achieved. Expenses 
related to forfeited awards are reversed as forfeitures occur. In addition, all nonforfeitable dividends paid on share-based payment 
awards are initially recognized in retained earnings and reclassified to compensation cost only if forfeitures of the underlying awards 
occur.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
  On July 1, 2018, we early adopted an ASU on share-based payments to non-employees. Under the new ASU, our non-
employee share-based awards are measured on the grant date and recognized over the required service period of the recipient, in the 
same way as are share-based awards granted to employees. Under the previous accounting standards, non-employee share-based 
awards were remeasured to their fair value quarterly. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated 
financial statements.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Lease accounting
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and 
disclosure of leases for both parties to a lease agreement (i.e., lessees and lessors). Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs 
that further clarified the original ASU. The ASUs became effective for us on January 1, 2019. Upon adoption of the lease ASUs on 
January 1, 2019, we elected the following practical expedients provided by these ASUs and discussed in greater detail within this 
“Lease Accounting” section of the “Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” The summary of the elected practical expedients is provided 
below: 
•  Package of practical expedients – requires us not to reevaluate our existing or expired leases as of January 1, 2019, under 
the new lease accounting ASUs.
•  Optional transition method practical expedient – requires us to apply the new lease ASUs prospectively from the 
adoption date of January 1, 2019.
•  Land easements practical expedient – requires us to account for land easements existing as of January 1, 2019, under the 
accounting standards applied to them prior to January 1, 2019.
•  Single component practical expedient –  requires us to account for lease and nonlease components associated with that 
lease under the new lease ASUs, if certain criteria are met.
•  Short-term leases practical expedient – for our operating leases with a term of 12 months or less in which we are the 
lessee, this expedient requires us not to record on our balance sheets related lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. 
Overview related to both lessee and lessor accounting
  The lease ASUs set new criteria for determining the classification of finance leases for lessees and sales-type leases for 
lessors. The criteria to determine whether a lease should be accounted for as a finance (sales-type) lease include the following: (i) 
ownership is transferred from lessor to lessee by the end of the lease term, (ii) an option to purchase is reasonably certain to be 
exercised, (iii) the lease term is for the major part of the underlying asset’s remaining economic life, (iv) the present value of lease 
payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset, and (v) the underlying asset is specialized and is 
expected to have no alternative use at the end of the lease term. If any of these criteria is met, a lease is classified as a finance lease by 
the lessee and as a sales-type lease by the lessor. If none of the criteria are met, a lease is classified as an operating lease by the lessee, 
but may still qualify as a direct financing lease or an operating lease for the lessor. The existence of a residual value guarantee from an 
unrelated third party other than the lessee may qualify the lease as a direct financing lease by the lessor. Otherwise, the lease is 
classified as an operating lease by the lessor.
  The new lease ASUs require the use of the modified retrospective transition method. On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new 
lease ASUs electing the package of practical expedients and the optional transition method permitting January 1, 2019, to be our initial 
application date. Our election of the package of practical expedients and the optional transition method allowed us not to reassess: 
•  Whether any expired or existing contracts as of January 1, 2019, were leases or contained leases.
•  This practical expedient is primarily applicable to entities that have contracts containing embedded leases. As of 
December 31, 2018, we had no such contracts, therefore this practical expedient had no effect on us. 
•  The lease classification for any leases expired or existing as of January 1, 2019.
•  Our election of the package of practical expedients required us not to revisit the classification of our leases existing 
as of January 1, 2019. For example, all of our leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with the 
lease accounting standards in effect prior to January 1, 2019, continue to be classified as operating leases after 
adoption of the new lease ASUs.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Recent accounting pronouncements (continued)
Lease accounting (continued)
•  Previously capitalized initial direct costs for any leases existing as of January 1, 2019.
•  Our election of the package of practical expedients required us not to reassess whether initial direct leasing costs 
capitalized prior to the adoption of the new lease ASUs in connection with the leases that commenced prior to 
January 1, 2019, qualify for capitalization under the new lease ASUs. We will continue to amortize these costs as we 
did under the lease accounting standards in effect prior to January 1, 2019. 
  We applied the package of practical expedients consistently to all leases (i.e., in which we are a lessee or a lessor) that 
commenced before January 1, 2019. The election of this package permits us to “run off” our leases that commenced before January 1, 
2019, for the remainder of their lease terms and to apply the new lease ASUs to leases commencing or modified after January 1, 2019. 
On January 1, 2019, we recognized a cumulative adjustment, as required by the new lease ASU, to retained earnings aggregating 
$3.5 million to write off lease origination costs that were capitalized in connection with leases that were executed but had not 
commenced before January 1, 2019. These costs were capitalized in accordance with the lease accounting standards existing prior to 
January 1, 2019, and would not qualify for capitalization under the new lease ASUs.
  On January 1, 2019, we recognized a lease liability aggregating $218.7 million for all operating leases in which we are a 
lessee based on the present value of the minimum rental payments remaining as of the initial application date of January 1, 2019. On 
January 1, 2019, we also recognized a right-of-use asset primarily corresponding to the lease liability. See detailed discussion in the 
“Lessee Accounting” subsection below.
  In addition, we had certain land easement contracts in effect as of January 1, 2019. Pursuant to our election of the package of 
practical expedients described above, no reassessment of these contracts was required. Consequently, the adoption of the new lease 
ASUs had no effect on our accounting of land easements existing on January 1, 2019.
  Lessor accounting
  We recognized revenue from our lease agreements aggregating $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This 
revenue consisted primarily of rental revenues and tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2018, aggregating 
$963.6 million and $304.1 million, respectively.
  Prior to January 1, 2019, we recognized rental revenue from our operating leases on a straight-line basis over the respective 
lease terms. We commenced recognition of rental revenue at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes 
possession of, or controls the physical use of, the property. We recognized rental revenue from direct financing leases over the lease 
term by using the effective interest rate method. Refer to Note 8 – “Other assets” to these consolidated financial statements for further 
details on our direct financing leases.
Prior to January 1, 2019, we considered tenant recoveries related to payments of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs 
and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses as lease components. We recognized these tenant recoveries as 
revenue when services were rendered in an amount equal to the related operating expenses incurred that were recoverable under the 
terms of the applicable lease.
  Effective January 1, 2019
  Under the new lease ASUs, each lease agreement is evaluated to identify the lease and nonlease components at lease 
inception. The total consideration in the lease agreement is allocated to the lease and nonlease components based on their relative 
stand-alone selling prices. The new lease ASUs govern the recognition of revenue for lease components, and revenue related to 
nonlease components is subject to the revenue recognition ASU. Tenant recoveries for utilities, repairs and maintenance, and common 
area expenses are considered nonlease components. If a lessee makes payments for taxes and insurance directly to a third party on 
behalf of a lessor, lessors are required to exclude them from variable payments and from recognition in the lessors’ income statements. 
Otherwise, tenant recoveries for taxes and insurance are classified as additional lease revenue recognized by the lessor on a gross basis 
in their income statements.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Recent accounting pronouncements (continued)
Lease accounting (continued)
  On January 1, 2019, we elected the single component practical expedient, which requires us, by class of underlying asset, not 
to allocate the total consideration to the lease and nonlease components based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. This single 
component practical expedient requires us to account for the lease component and nonlease component(s) associated with that lease as 
a single component if (i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease component and the nonlease component(s) associated with it 
are the same and (ii) the lease component would be classified as an operating lease if it were accounted for separately. If we determine 
that the lease component is the predominant component, we account for the single component as an operating lease in accordance with 
the new lease ASUs. Conversely, we are required to account for the combined component under the new revenue recognition ASU if 
we determine that the nonlease component is the predominant component. As a result of this assessment, rental revenues and tenant 
recoveries from the lease of real estate assets that qualify for this expedient are accounted for as a single component under the new 
lease ASUs, with tenant recoveries primarily as variable consideration. Tenant recoveries that do not qualify for the single component 
practical expedient and are considered nonlease components are accounted for under the revenue recognition ASUs. Our operating 
leases commencing or modified after January 1, 2019, for which we are the lessor are expected to qualify for the single component 
practical expedient accounting under the new lease ASUs. Refer to “Recognition of Revenue Arising from Contracts with Customers” 
subsection within the “Revenue Recognition” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for the detail of our 
consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, by lease revenues that would meet the single component practical 
expedient criteria and qualify to be accounted for under the new lease ASUs, and revenues subject to other accounting standards, 
including the ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
  Costs to execute leases
  The new lease ASUs require that lessors and lessees capitalize, as initial direct costs, only incremental costs of a lease that 
would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. Effective January 1, 2019, costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange 
a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and costs related 
to advertising or soliciting potential tenants will be expensed as incurred. 
  We estimate that approximately $5 million to $9 million of initial direct costs that were capitalized in 2018 would have been 
expensed if the new lease ASUs that are effective on January 1, 2019 had been in effect during 2018. Future expenses as a result of the 
change in the accounting for initial direct costs will depend on the future events that are not yet known; therefore, the ultimate impact 
on initial direct leasing costs from the adoption of the lease ASUs might differ from our estimate. 
  Under the package of practical expedients that we elected on January 1, 2019, we were not required to reassess whether 
initial direct leasing costs capitalized prior to the adoption of the new lease ASUs in connection with the leases that commenced prior 
to January 1, 2019, qualify for capitalization under the new lease ASUs. Therefore, we continue to amortize these initial direct leasing 
costs. 
  Lessee accounting
  Under the new lease ASUs, lessees are required to apply a dual approach by classifying leases as either finance or operating 
leases based on the principle of whether the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification 
will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease, which corresponds to a similar evaluation performed by lessors. In addition to this classification, a lessee is also required 
to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases regardless of their classification, whereas a lessor is not required to 
recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for any operating leases.
  On January 1, 2019, we recognized a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset aggregating $218.7 million 
representing our obligation for remaining future rental payments related to our operating leases existing as of January 1, 2019, for 
which we are the lessee. This liability was calculated as the present value of the lease payments aggregating $590.3 million remaining 
as of the initial application date of January 1, 2019, under our ground and office lease agreements for which we are the lessee. The 
present value of the remaining lease payments was calculated for each operating lease using each respective remaining lease term and 
a corresponding estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is the interest rate that we estimate we would have to pay to borrow on a 
collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Recent accounting pronouncements (continued)
Lease accounting (continued)
  Under the package of practical expedients that we elected upon adoption of the new lease ASUs, all of our operating leases 
existing as of January 1, 2019, for which we are the lessee, continue to be classified as operating leases subsequent to the adoption of 
the new lease ASUs. We have also evaluated the effect of the new lease ASUs on the calculation of our debt covenants as of 
December 31, 2018, and noted no significant effect on our calculation of our debt covenants.
Allowance for credit losses
  In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU (further clarified with subsequently issued updates) that changes the impairment 
model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred 
losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The ASU will apply to most financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net 
investments in leases arising from sales-type and direct financing leases, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (i.e., loan 
commitments). The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and will 
be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently assessing the potential effect the 
adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Fair value measurement disclosures
  In August 2018, the FASB issued an ASU that modifies certain fair value disclosure requirements, including those related to 
investments measured at NAV as a practical expedient to estimate their fair value. Entities that use this practical expedient will be 
required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investee’s assets and the date when redemption restrictions will lapse, but only if 
the investee has communicated this information to the entity or announced it publicly. If the timing is unknown, entities will be 
required to disclose that fact. We early adopted this guidance effective on July 1, 2018. The adoption of this ASU had no effect on our 
consolidated financial statements. 
Joint venture distributions
  On January 1, 2018, we adopted an ASU that provides guidance on the classification in the statement of cash flows of cash 
distributions received from equity method investments, including unconsolidated joint ventures. The ASU provides two approaches to 
determine the classification of cash distributions received from equity method investees: (i) the “cumulative earnings” approach, under 
which distributions up to the amount of cumulative equity in earnings recognized are classified as cash inflows from operating 
activities, and those in excess of that amount are classified as cash inflows from investing activities, and (ii) the “nature of the 
distribution” approach, under which distributions are classified based on the nature of the underlying activity that generated cash 
distributions. An entity could elect either the “cumulative earnings” or the “nature of the distribution” approach. If the “nature of the 
distribution” approach is elected and the entity lacks the information necessary to apply it in the future, that entity will have to apply 
the “cumulative earnings” approach as an accounting change on a retrospective basis. We adopted this ASU using the “nature of the 
distribution” approach and applied it retrospectively, as required by the ASU. We previously presented distributions from our equity 
method investees by utilizing the “nature of the distribution” approach; therefore, the adoption of this ASU had no effect on our 
consolidated financial statements. 
Restricted cash
  On January 1, 2018, we adopted an ASU that requires entities to include restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when 
reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows. The ASU requires 
disclosure of a reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows when the balance sheet includes more than 
one line item for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. An entity with material restricted cash and 
restricted cash equivalents balances is required to disclose the nature of the restrictions. The ASU required a retrospective application 
to all periods presented. Subsequent to the adoption of this ASU, prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 
current-period presentation, resulting in restricted cash balances that are included with cash and cash equivalents balances as of the 
beginning and ending of each period presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Separate line items reconciling changes 
in restricted cash balances to the changes in cash and cash equivalents are no longer presented within the operating, investing, and 
financing sections of our consolidated statements of cash flows.

2.  Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Recent accounting pronouncements (continued)
Hedge accounting
  On January 1, 2018, we adopted an ASU that simplifies hedge accounting. The ASU requires prospective adoption for hedges 
in effect at the date of adoption and is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption 
permitted. The purpose of this ASU is to better align a company’s financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic 
objectives of those activities. For cash flow hedges that are highly effective, the new standard requires all changes (effective and 
ineffective components) in the fair value of the hedging instrument to be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within 
total equity and to be reclassified into earnings only when the hedged item affects earnings. 
  Prior to the adoption of this ASU, a quantitative assessment was made on an ongoing basis to determine whether a hedge is 
highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged item. Previously applied hedge accounting guidance 
required hedge ineffectiveness to be recognized in earnings. Under the new ASU, an entity is still required to perform an initial 
quantitative test. However, the new standard allows an entity to elect to subsequently perform only a qualitative assessment, unless 
facts and circumstances change. We made this election upon adoption of the new ASU on January 1, 2018. 
  We utilize interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated 
with borrowings based on LIBOR. As a result, all of our interest rate hedge agreements are designated as cash flow hedges. For cash 
flow hedges in existence at the date of adoption, an entity is required to apply a cumulative-effect adjustment for previously 
recognized ineffectiveness from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
when an entity adopts the amendments in this ASU. 
  We performed an analysis of all our cash flow hedges existing on January 1, 2018, and determined that all hedges had been 
highly effective since their inception; therefore, no cumulative-effect adjustment of previously recognized ineffectiveness from 
retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income was needed. The adoption of this ASU had no effect on our 
consolidated financial statements. 
  Additionally, in October 2018, the FASB issued an ASU that expands the list of U.S. benchmark interest rates permitted in 
the application of hedge accounting to include the overnight index swap rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
(“SOFR”). The ASU became effective for us and was adopted on January 1, 2019. We have no hedges involving SOFR, therefore, the 
adoption of this ASU had no effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We evaluated each acquisition to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired met the definition of a 
business. Acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. An integrated set of assets 
and activities does not qualify as a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets is concentrated in either a single 
identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, or if the acquired assets do not include a substantive process. 
  We evaluated each of the completed acquisitions and determined that substantially all of the fair value related to each 
acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, or is a land parcel with no operations. 
Accordingly, each transaction did not meet the definition of a business and consequently was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In 
each of these transactions, we allocated the total consideration for each acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities acquired on a 
relative fair value basis.

(4)  Represents our ownership interest; our voting interest is limited to 50%.
(5)   Joint venture with a distinguished retail real estate developer for the development of an approximate 90,000 RSF retail shopping center.
  Our consolidation policy is fully described under the “Consolidation” section within Note 2 – “Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements. Consolidation accounting is highly technical, but its framework is 
primarily based on the controlling financial interests and benefits of the joint ventures. We generally consolidate a joint venture that is 
a legal entity that we control (i.e., we have the power to direct the activities of the joint venture that most significantly affect its 
economic performance) through contractual rights, regardless of our ownership interest, and where we determine that we have benefits 
through the allocation of earnings or losses and fees paid to us that could be significant to the joint venture (the “VIE model”). We also 
generally consolidate joint ventures when we have a controlling financial interest through voting rights and where our voting interest 
is greater than 50% (the “voting model”). Voting interest differs from ownership interest for some joint ventures. We account for joint 
ventures that do not meet the consolidation criteria under the equity method of accounting by recognizing our share of income and 
losses. The table below shows our categorization of our existing significant joint ventures under the consolidation framework:

the balance sheet information of these entities on an aggregated basis. For each of our consolidated VIEs, none of its assets have 
restrictions that limit their use to settle specific obligations of the VIE. There are no creditors or other partners of our consolidated 
VIEs that have recourse to our general credit. Our maximum exposure to our consolidated VIEs is limited to our variable interests in 
each VIE.

210,709 RSF, located in the Longwood Medical Area submarket of Greater Boston. In September 2018, we sold our partial interest in 
this unconsolidated real estate joint venture for a contractual sales price, net of debt repaid, of $70.0 million, which represents a gross 
sales price of $1,659 per RSF. We received proceeds of $68.6 million, net of closing costs. We have elected as an accounting policy to 
reflect unconsolidated joint venture distributions in our consolidated statements of cash flows using the nature of the distribution 
approach. Accordingly, the net proceeds were classified as return of capital from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures within the 
investing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended 
December 31, 2018, in connection with the sale, we recognized a gain of $35.7 million, net of closing costs and other liabilities of the 
joint venture, which is reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
  In August 2018, our unconsolidated real estate joint venture at Menlo Gateway, located in our Greater Stanford submarket of 
San Francisco, refinanced the secured note payable related to Phase I of the project. The new $145.0 million loan bears interest at a 
fixed rate of 4.15%, and the net proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance of $133.1 million of the previous secured note 
payable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, in connection with the refinancing, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of 
debt of $761 thousand related to our share of the write-off of unamortized premiums, which is reflected in equity in earnings of 
unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.
  As of December 31, 2018, our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures have the following non-recourse secured loans that 
include the following key terms (dollars in thousands):

7.  Investments
  We hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science and 
technology industries. On January 1, 2018, we adopted a new ASU on financial instruments that prospectively changed how we 
recognize, measure, present, and disclose these investments.
Key differences between prior accounting standards and the new ASU
Prior to January 1, 2018:
•  Investments in publicly traded companies were presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair 
value recognized in other comprehensive income classified in accumulated other comprehensive income within total equity.
•  Investments in privately held entities were generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting.
•  Gains or losses were recognized in net income upon the disposition of an investment.
•  Investments in privately held entities required accounting under the equity method unless our interest in the entity was 
deemed to be so minor that we had virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies. Under the equity 
method of accounting, we recognized our investment initially at cost and adjusted the carrying amount of the investment to 
recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. We had no investments 
accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2017.
•  Investments were evaluated for impairment, with other-than-temporary impairments recognized in net income.
Effective January 1, 2018:
•  Investments in publicly traded companies are presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair 
value recognized in net income.
•  Investments in privately held entities without readily determinable fair values previously accounted for under the cost method 
are accounted for as follows:
•  Investments in privately held entities that report NAV are presented at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient, with 
changes in fair value recognized in net income. We use NAV reported by limited partnerships without adjustment, unless 
we are aware of information indicating that the NAV reported by a limited partnership does not accurately reflect the fair 
value of the investment at our reporting date. 
•  Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV are carried at cost, adjusted for observable price changes 
and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. These investments continue to be evaluated on the basis of a 
qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by utilizing the same monitoring criteria described above and 
monitoring the presence of the following impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings 
performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the 
regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general 
market condition of either the geographical area or the industry in which the investee operates, (iv) significant concerns 
about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the 
investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss, without consideration as to whether the 
impairment is other-than-temporary, in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in excess of its estimated fair 
value.

  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  F-32
7.   Investments (continued)
•  On January 1, 2018, we recognized the following adjustments upon adoption of the new ASU:
•  For investments in publicly traded companies, reclassification of cumulative unrealized gains as of December 31, 2017, 
aggregating $49.8 million, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
•  For investments in privately held entities without readily determinable fair values that were previously accounted for 
under the cost method:
•  Adjustment to investments for unrealized gains aggregating $90.8 million related to investments in privately held 
entities that report NAV, representing the difference between fair value as of December 31, 2017, using NAV as a 
practical expedient and the carrying value of the investments as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding 
adjustment to retained earnings.
•  No adjustment was required for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. The ASU requires a 
prospective transition approach for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. The FASB clarified 
that it would be difficult for entities to determine the last observable transaction price existing prior to the adoption 
of this ASU. Therefore, unlike our investments in privately held entities that report NAV that were adjusted to reflect 
fair values upon adoption of the new ASU, our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV were 
not included in the cumulative adjustment recorded on January 1, 2018 to adjust fair values upon adoption. As such, 
any initial valuation adjustments made for investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV subsequent 
to January 1, 2018, as a result of future observable price changes will include recognition of unrealized gains or 
losses equal to the difference between the carrying basis of the investment and the observable price at the date of 
remeasurement.
•  Investments in privately held entities continue to require accounting under the equity method unless our interest in the entity 
is deemed to be so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies. Under the 
equity method of accounting, we initially recognize our investment at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment 
to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. We had no 
investments accounted for under the equity method as of December 31, 2018.
  We recognize unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses within investment income in our consolidated statements 
of operations. Unrealized gains and losses represent changes in fair value for investments in publicly traded companies, changes in NAV, 
as a practical expedient to estimate fair value, for investments in privately held entities that report NAV, and observable price changes 
on our investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. Impairments are realized losses, which result in an adjusted cost, 
and represent charges to reduce the carrying values of investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV to their estimated fair 
value. Realized gains and losses represent the difference between proceeds received upon disposition of investments and their historical 
or adjusted cost.
  The following tables summarize our investments as of December 31, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):
December 31, 2018

7.   Investments (continued)
  Adjustments recognized in investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV aggregating $64.1 million as of 
December 31, 2018, consisted of upward adjustments representing unrealized gains of $64.3 million and downward adjustments 
representing unrealized losses of $200 thousand. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we also recognized an impairment charge 
of $5.5 million primarily related to one investment in a privately held entity that does not report NAV. 
  For investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV, an observable price is a price observed in an orderly 
transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity 
transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity 
transactions related to the same issuer. For these transactions to be considered observable price changes, we evaluate whether these 
transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, 
to the investments we hold.  
Investments in privately held entities that report NAV
Investments in privately held entities that report NAV consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships. We are 
committed to funding approximately $248.3 million for all investments, primarily consisting of $247.8 million related to investments 
in limited partnerships. Our funding commitments expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a weighted-average expiration 
of 8.8 years. 
These investments are not redeemable by us, but we normally receive distributions from these investments throughout their 
term. Our investments in privately held entities that report NAV generally have expected initial terms in excess of 10 years. The 
weighted-average remaining term during which these investments are expected to be liquidated was 7.0 years as of December 31, 
2018. 
  Our investment income for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisted of the following (in thousands):

do not report NAV, held at period end, representing an impairment charge related to one investment in a privately held entity that does 
not report NAV.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized unrealized gains of $24.4 million on our equity securities 
classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2017. These unrealized gains were recognized in our other comprehensive income 
and classified in accumulated other comprehensive income within total equity, in accordance with the accounting standards in effect 
prior to January 1, 2018.

In addition, we recognized investment income related to gains recognized in net income upon the sale of investments totaling 
$1.3 million and $17.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in accordance with the accounting 
standards in effect prior to January 1, 2018, as further described above. These gains are classified within other income in our 
consolidated statements of operations for 2017 and 2016. The required prospective adoption of the new financial instruments ASU on 
January 1, 2018 impacted the comparability of our 2018 consolidated financial statements to our 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial 
statements.

9.  Fair value measurements
We provide fair value information about all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. We 
measure and disclose the estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities by utilizing a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes 
between data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market 
participant assumptions. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels, as follows: (i) quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities (Level 1), (ii) significant other observable inputs (Level 2), and (iii) significant unobservable inputs (Level 
3). Significant other observable inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that 
are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves. Significant unobservable inputs 
are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, since there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances in which the 
determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair 
value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. There were no transfers between the levels in the fair value 
hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The following tables set forth the assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the 
fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):

Our investments in publicly traded companies have been recognized at fair value. Investments in privately held entities are 
excluded from the fair value hierarchy above as required by the fair value standards. Refer to Note 7 – “Investments” to our 
consolidated financial statements for further details.
Our interest rate hedge agreements have been recognized at fair value. Refer to Note 11 – “Interest Rate Hedge Agreements” 
to our consolidated financial statements for further details. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, tenant 
receivables, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits approximate fair value.

9.  Fair value measurements (continued)
The fair values of our secured notes payable, unsecured senior notes payable, $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, and 
unsecured senior bank term loans were estimated using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses 
using significant other observable inputs such as available market information on discount and borrowing rates with similar terms, 
maturities, and credit ratings. Because the valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair 
value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Additionally, the use of different 
market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the book and estimated fair values of our investments in privately held entities that 
report NAV, secured notes payable, unsecured senior notes payable, unsecured senior line of credit, and unsecured senior bank term

Amendment of unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan
On September 28, 2018, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan to extend the 
maturity date of each to January 28, 2024, including two six-month extension options related to our unsecured senior line of credit, 
and to increase the aggregate commitment for our unsecured senior line of credit to $2.2 billion from $1.65 billion. 
As a result of the amendment and improvement in our credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service during the third quarter 
of 2018, the overall applicable interest rate margin decreased to 0.825% from 1.00% for our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of 
credit, and to 0.90% from 1.10% for our unsecured senior bank term loan. The facility fee related to our $2.2 billion unsecured senior 
line of credit also decreased to 0.15% from 0.20%. In connection with these amendments, we recognized a loss on early 
extinguishment of debt of approximately $634 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

10. Secured and unsecured senior debt (continued)
We use our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, 
acquisition of properties. Borrowings under the $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate,” 
a “LIBOR Floating Rate, or a “Base Rate” specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any 
case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the amended $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit agreement 
is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent 
and the Company for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual 
yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap 
Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative 
currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The LIBOR Floating 
Rate means, for any day, one month LIBOR, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the Company for 
loans denominated in U.S. dollars. The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the 
federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of 
America as its “prime rate,” and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%. Our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit contains a 
feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. This may result in an interest rate 
that is below the stated rate. In addition to the cost of borrowing, the facility is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the 
aggregate commitments outstanding. 
Repayment of unsecured senior bank term loan
  During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we repaid the remaining $200.0 million balance under our 2019 
unsecured senior bank term loan and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $189 thousand related to the write-off of 
unamortized loan fees. 
Unsecured senior notes payable
  As of December 31, 2018, we have unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $4.3 billion, which are unsecured obligations 
of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., a 100% owned subsidiary of 
the Company. The unsecured senior notes payable rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured 
indebtedness. However, the unsecured senior notes payable are subordinate to existing and future mortgages and other secured 
indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and to all existing and future preferred equity and 
liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P. In addition, 
the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the 
Company’s subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, and 
(ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.
 
4.00% and 4.70% unsecured senior notes payables
  In June 2018, we completed an offering of $900.0 million of unsecured senior notes for net proceeds of $891.4 million. The 
offering consisted of $450.0 million of 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable on January 15, 2024, which will be used to fund certain 
eligible green development and redevelopment projects that have received or are expected to receive LEED® Gold or Platinum 
certification, and $450.0 million of 4.70% unsecured senior notes payable on July 1, 2030.
Repayment of secured construction loan
In July 2018, we repaid $150.0 million of the outstanding balance of our secured construction loan and reduced aggregate 
commitments to $200.0 million. In connection with the partial repayment of the secured construction loan, we recognized a loss on 
early extinguishment of debt of $299 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

Interest expense
Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2017 2016
Interest incurred $ 223,715 $ 186,867 $ 159,403
Capitalized interest (66,220) (58,222) (52,450)
Interest expense $ 157,495 $ 128,645 $ 106,953
11.  Interest rate hedge agreements
We use interest rate derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with certain of our existing LIBOR-based 
variable-rate debt, including our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loan, and secured notes 
payable, and to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility. 
The fair value of each interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including 
discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the 
derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied 
volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the 
discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an 
expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation 
also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using “significant unobservable inputs,” such as estimates 
of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of 
our interest rate hedge agreements.
Changes in fair value, including accrued interest and adjustments for non-performance risk, of our interest rate hedge 
agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are classified in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which 
the hedged transactions affect earnings. During the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify approximately $1.9 million from 
accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings as a decrease of interest expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair 
values of our interest rate hedge agreements aggregating an asset balance were classified in other assets, and the fair values of our 
interest rate hedge agreements aggregating a liability balance were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant 
security deposits, based upon their respective fair values, without any offsetting pursuant to master netting agreements. Refer to Note 
9 – “Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements for further details. Under our interest rate hedge agreements, 
we have no collateral posting requirements.
We have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision wherein we could be declared in 
default on our derivative obligations if (i) repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on 
the indebtedness or (ii) we default on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been 
accelerated by the lender. If we had breached any of these provisions as of December 31, 2018, we could have been required to settle 
our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $344 thousand.

the column heading “Stated Rate” in our summary table of outstanding indebtedness and respective principal payments under Note 10 – “Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt” to our 
consolidated financial statements.
12.  Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits

December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):

Some of our properties may contain asbestos, which, under certain conditions, requires remediation. Although we believe that 
the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with environmental regulations, our practice is to remediate the asbestos upon 
the development or redevelopment of the affected property. We recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement 
obligation (including asbestos) when the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. For certain properties, we do not 
recognize an asset retirement obligation when there is an indeterminate settlement date for the obligation because the period in which 
we may remediate the obligation may not be estimated with any level of precision to provide a meaningful estimate of the retirement 
obligation.

13. Earnings per share
  In January 2018, we entered into forward equity sales agreements to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of our common 
stock (including the exercise of underwriters’ option) at a public offering price of $123.50 per share, before underwriting discounts 
and further adjustments as provided for in the sales agreement. We settled all 6.9 million shares of common stock during the year 
ended December 31, 2018, of which 5.2 million shares were settled during the three months ended December 31, 2018.
 
  In March 2017, we entered into agreements to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of our common stock, which consisted 
of an initial issuance of 2.1 million shares and 4.8 million shares subject to forward equity sales agreements, at a public offering price 
of $108.55 per share less issuance costs, underwriters’ discount, and further adjustments as provided for in the sales agreements. We 
issued the initial 2.1 million shares at closing in March 2017 and settled the remaining 4.8 million shares of common stock in 
December 2017. 
  Refer to Note 16 – “Stockholders’ Equity” to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion related to our forward 
equity sales agreements executed in January 2018 and March 2017.
  To account for the forward equity sales agreements, we considered the accounting guidance governing financial instruments 
and derivatives and concluded that our forward equity sales agreements were not liabilities as they did not embody obligations to 
repurchase our shares nor did they embody obligations to issue a variable number of shares for which the monetary value was 
predominantly fixed, varied with something other than the fair value of our shares, or varied inversely in relation to our shares. We 
then evaluated whether the agreements met the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception to be accounted for as equity 
instruments and concluded that the agreements can be classified as equity contracts based on the following assessment: (i) none of the 
agreements’ exercise contingencies were based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market for our own stock 
price and operations; and (ii) none of the settlement provisions precluded the agreements from being indexed to our own stock.
  We also considered the potential dilution resulting from the forward equity sales agreements on the EPS calculations. At 
inception, the agreements do not have an effect on the computation of basic EPS as no shares are delivered until settlement. The 
common shares issued upon the settlement of the forward equity sales agreements, weighted for the period these
common shares were outstanding, are included in the denominator of basic EPS. 
  The number of weighted-average shares outstanding – diluted used in the computation of EPS for the year ended December 
31, 2018, using the treasury stock method to determine the dilution resulting from the forward equity sales agreements during the 
period of time prior to settlement. The effect on our weighted-average shares – diluted for the year ended December 31, 2018, was 311 
thousand weighted-average incremental shares from the forward equity sales agreement entered into in January 2018. For the year 
ended December 31, 2017, the effect on our weighted-average shares – diluted from the forward equity sales agreements entered into 
in March 2017 was 517 thousand weighted-average incremental shares. 
  For purposes of calculating diluted EPS, we did not assume conversion of our 7.00% Series D cumulative convertible 
preferred stock (“Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, since the result was 
antidilutive to EPS attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders from continuing operations during 
those periods. Refer to “7.00% Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Repurchases” in Note 16 – “Stockholders’ Equity” to 
our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the partial repurchases of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.
We account for unvested restricted stock awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends as participating securities and 
include these securities in the computation of EPS using the two-class method. Our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and forward 
equity sales agreements are not participating securities and are therefore not included in the computation of EPS using the two-class 
method. Under the two-class method, we allocate net income (after amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, dividends on 
preferred stock, and preferred stock redemption charge) to common stockholders and unvested restricted stock awards by using the 
weighted-average shares of each class outstanding for quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods independently, based on their respective 
participation rights to dividends declared (or accumulated) and undistributed earnings.

14.  Income taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We believe we 
have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. Under the Code, a REIT that distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to 
its shareholders annually and meets certain other conditions is not subject to federal income taxes, but could be subject to certain state, 
local, and foreign taxes. We distribute 100% of our taxable income annually; therefore, a provision for federal income taxes is not 
required. 
We distributed all of our REIT taxable income in 2017 and 2016 and, as a result, did not incur federal income tax in those 
years on such income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we expect our distributions to exceed our REIT taxable income and, as 
a result, do not expect to incur federal income tax. We expect to finalize our 2018 REIT taxable income when we file our 2018 federal 
income tax return in 2019.
The income tax treatment of distributions and dividends declared on our common stock, our Series D Convertible Preferred 
Stock, and our Series E Redeemable Preferred Stock for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were as follows

Series E Preferred Stock.
  Beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 added Section 199A to allow for a new tax deduction based on certain 
qualified business income. Section 199A provides eligible individual taxpayers a deduction of up to 20 percent of their qualified real 
estate investment trust dividends.
Our dividends declared in a given quarter are generally paid during the subsequent quarter. The taxability information 
presented above for our dividends paid in 2018 is based upon management’s estimate. Our federal tax return for 2018 is due on or 
before October 15, 2019, assuming we file for an extension of the due date. Our federal tax returns for previous tax years have not 
been examined by the IRS. Consequently, the taxability of distributions and dividends is subject to change. The income tax treatment 
of distributions and dividends noted above for the year ended December 31, 2018, is inclusive of the changes to taxable income 
related to our 2018 real estate transactions described in Note 3 – “Investments in Real Estate” to our consolidated financial statements 
under Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
In addition to our REIT tax returns, we file federal, state, and local tax returns for our subsidiaries. We file with jurisdictions 
located in the U.S., Canada, India, China, and other international locations and may be subject to audits, assessments, or other actions 
by local taxing authorities. We recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position 
will be sustained, based solely on its technical merits, with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. The 
measurement of a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that meets the “more likely than not” threshold is based on a cumulative 
probability model under which the largest amount of tax benefit recognized is the amount with a greater than 50% likelihood of being 
realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
As of December 31, 2018, there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. We do not anticipate a significant change to the 
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

respectively.
15. Commitments and contingencies
Employee retirement savings plan
We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code whereby our employees may contribute a portion 
of their compensation to their respective retirement accounts in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed under the Code. In 
addition to employee contributions, we have elected to provide company discretionary profit-sharing contributions (subject to 
statutory limitations), which amounted to approximately $4.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 
2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the 
contributions made on their behalf by the Company.
Concentration of credit risk
We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions. The combined account balances at each 
institution periodically exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage of $250,000, and, as a result, 
there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. We have not experienced any losses to 
date on our invested cash.
In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, we 
spread our interest rate hedge agreements among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2018, the largest aggregate notional 
amount of interest rate hedge agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $150.0 million. If 
one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with 
our variable-rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated.
We are dependent on rental revenue from relatively few tenants. The inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments 
could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 708 leases with a total of 537 tenants, and 116, or 49%, of our 
237 properties were each leased to a single tenant. As of December 31, 2018, our three largest tenants, comprising 3.6%, 3.3%, and 
2.9%, accounted for approximately 9.8% of our aggregate annual rental revenue.

15.  Commitments and contingencies (continued)
Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing 
development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $829.9 million. We expect payments for 
these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability 
to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. We have existing office space 
at 161 First Street/50 Rogers Street in our Alexandria Center® at Kendall Square (“ACKS”) campus that we are required to partially 
convert to multifamily residential space, pursuant to our entitlements for our ACKS campus. Pursuant to these requirements, we 
expect to begin construction of the conversion to multifamily residential in 2019. In addition, we have letters of credit and 
performance obligations aggregating $9.2 million primarily related to construction projects.
  In March 2018, we acquired a 10% interest in a real estate joint venture with Uber Technologies, Inc. and the Golden State 
Warriors that owns 1655 and 1725 Third Street, located in our Mission Bay/SoMa submarket of San Francisco. Our total equity 
contribution commitment is $78.0 million, of which we have contributed $32.0 million through December 31, 2018. 
  In November 2017, we entered into an agreement with a real estate developer in the San Francisco Bay Area to own a 49% 
interest in a real estate joint venture at Menlo Gateway in our Greater Stanford submarket of San Francisco. Our total equity 
contribution commitment is $269.0 million, of which we have contributed $177.7 million through December 31, 2018. 
  We are committed to funding approximately $248.3 million for all investments, which primarily consist of $247.8 million 
related to investments in limited partnerships. Our funding commitments expire at various dates over the next 11 years, with a 
weighted-average remaining period of 8.8 years. 
Rental expense
Our rental expense attributable to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, was 
approximately $15.8 million, $14.0 million, and $14.3 million, respectively. These rental expense amounts include certain operating 
leases for our headquarters and field offices and ground leases for 29 of our properties. Ground leases generally require fixed annual 
rent payments and may also include escalation clauses and renewal options. Future minimum lease obligations under non-cancelable 
ground and other operating leases as of December 31, 2018, were as follows (in thousands):
Year Office Leases Ground Leases Total
2019 $ 1,777 $ 12,804 $ 14,581

Total $ 2,372 $ 587,900 $ 590,272
Our operating lease obligations related to our office leases have remaining terms of up to three years, exclusive of extension 
options. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of approximately 
$8.8 million as of December 31, 2018, our ground lease obligations have remaining terms generally ranging from 35 to 96 years, 
including extension options.

  The dividends on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. We

and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption provisions. We are not allowed to redeem our Series D Convertible 
Preferred Stock, except to preserve our status as a REIT. Investors in our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock generally have no 
voting rights. We may, at our option, be able to cause some or all of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically 
converted if the closing sale price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds 150% of the then-applicable conversion price of 
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading 
day immediately prior to our issuance of a press release announcing the exercise of our conversion option. Holders of our Series D 
Convertible Preferred Stock, at their option, may, at any time and from time to time, convert some or all of their outstanding shares 
initially at a conversion rate of 0.2477 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation preference, which was equivalent to an initial 
conversion price of approximately $100.93 per share of common stock. The conversion rate for the Series D Convertible Preferred 
Stock is subject to adjustments for certain events, including, but not limited to, certain dividends on our common stock in excess of 
$0.78 per share per quarter and dividends on our common stock payable in shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, the 
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock had a conversion rate of approximately 0.2502 shares of common stock per $25.00 liquidation 
preference, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $99.92 per share of common stock.

Common stock, preferred stock, and excess stock authorizations
Our charter authorizes the issuance of 200.0 million shares of common stock, of which 111.0 million shares were issued and 
outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Our charter also authorizes the issuance of up to 100.0 million shares of preferred stock, of 
which 2.6 million shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In addition, 200.0 million shares of “excess stock” (as 
defined in our charter) are authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
Additional paid-in capital
  In 2017, we sold partial interests in 9625 Towne Centre Drive and development rights at Campus Pointe by Alexandria, 
which comprised of 10260 and 10290 Campus Point Drive and 4110 Campus Point Court as December 31, 2017. Since we retained 
controlling interests in both joint ventures following the sale, we continued to consolidate these entities and accounted for the proceeds 
received as equity financing transactions. The difference of $7.7 million between the aggregate proceeds of approximately $26.0 
million received through December 31, 2017, and the corresponding partial interest in our cost basis of $18.3 million was recorded as 
an adjustment to additional paid-in capital in 2017. These transactions did not qualify as sales of real estate and did not result in 
purchase accounting adjustments to the carrying value. Accordingly, the carrying amounts of our partner’s share of assets and 
liabilities are reported at historical cost.

17. Share-based compensation
Stock plan
For the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest-quality personnel, providing for additional incentives, and promoting 
the success of our Company, we have historically issued two forms of share-based compensation under our equity incentive plan: (i) 
options to purchase common stock and (ii) restricted stock. We have not granted any options since 2002. Each restricted share issued 
reduced the share reserve by three shares (3:1 ratio) prior to March 23, 2018, and by one share (1:1 ratio) on and after March 23, 2018. 
As of December 31, 2018, there were 2,433,810 shares reserved for the granting of future options and stock awards under the equity 
incentive plan.
In addition, the stock plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees, non-employees, and non-employee directors. A 
share award is an award of common stock that (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of forfeiture 
under Section 83 of the Code. Shares issued generally vest over a four-year period from the date of issuance, and the sale of the shares 
is restricted prior to the date of vesting. The unearned portion of time-based awards is amortized as stock compensation expense on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Certain restricted share awards are subject to vesting based upon the satisfaction of levels of 
performance and market conditions. Failure to satisfy the threshold performance conditions will result in the forfeiture of shares. 
Forfeiture of share awards with time-based or performance-based restrictions results in a reversal of previously recognized share-
based compensation expense. Forfeiture of share awards with market-based restrictions does not result in a reversal of previously 
recognized share-based compensation expense.
The following is a summary of the stock awards activity under our equity incentive plan and related information for the years 
ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:

Total gross compensation recognized for stock awards $ 57,341 $ 42,292 $ 37,037
Capitalized stock compensation $ 22,322 $ 16,682 $ 11,604
Certain restricted stock awards granted during 2015 through 2018 are subject to performance and market conditions. The 
grant date fair value of these awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model using the following assumptions for 
2018 and 2017, respectively: (i) expected term of 3.0 years and 3.0 years (equal to the remaining performance measurement period at 
the grant date), (ii) volatility of 16.0% and 22.0% (approximating a blended average of implied and historical volatilities), (iii) 
dividend yield of 3.1% and 3.2%, and (iv) risk-free rate of 2.15% and 1.46%.

17. Share-based compensation (continued)
As of December 31, 2018, there was $134.4 million of unrecognized compensation related to unvested share awards under 
the equity incentive plan, which is expected to be recognized over the next four years and has a weighted-average vesting period of 
approximately 17 months.
18. Noncontrolling interests
Noncontrolling interests represent the third-party interests in certain entities in which we have a controlling interest. These 
entities owned 11 properties as of December 31, 2018, and are included in our consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling 
interests are adjusted for additional contributions and distributions, the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses, and other 
comprehensive income or loss. Distributions, profits, and losses related to these entities are allocated in accordance with the respective 
operating agreements. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we distributed $30.7 million and $22.4 million, 
respectively, to our consolidated real estate joint venture partners.
Certain of our noncontrolling interests have the right to require us to redeem their ownership interests in the respective 
entities. We classify these ownership interests in the entities as redeemable noncontrolling interests outside of total equity in our 
consolidated balance sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are adjusted for additional contributions and distributions, the 
proportionate share of the net earnings or losses, and other comprehensive income or loss. If the amount of a redeemable 
noncontrolling interest is less than the maximum redemption value at the balance sheet date, such amount is adjusted to the maximum 
redemption value. Subsequent declines in the redemption value are recognized only to the extent that previous increases have been 
recognized.
19. Assets classified as held for sale
  As of December 31, 2018, one building aggregating 334,144 RSF was classified as held for sale and did not meet the criteria 
for classification as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

subsidiaries that own substantially all of its real estate (collectively, the “Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”), will not provide a 
guarantee of such securities, including the subsidiaries that are partially or 100% owned by the LP. The following condensed

Business Integrity Policy
and Procedures for Reporting Non-Compliance 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purposes of this Business Integrity Policy and Procedures for Reporting Non-Compliance (the “Policy”) are to ensure that 
all employees, officers, directors and consultants of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries 
(collectively, “ARE” or the “Company”) understand that it is the intent of the Company to comply with all laws and regulations 
and to transact business in accordance with the highest moral and ethical standards, including the requirements of Section 406 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and to provide procedures for employees, officers and directors to report instances of non-
compliance with this Policy. For the purpose of this Policy, “employees” includes all full-time and part-time employees of the 
Company, including temporary employees employed through third parties.
Any violation of this Policy will result in prompt disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and, in 
appropriate cases, civil action or referral for criminal prosecution.
POLICY SUMMARY
ARE has always sought to maintain a highly ethical and professional posture in the conduct of its business and operations, and 
to remain in strict compliance with all applicable legal requirements. ARE employees, officers, directors and consultants must 
not be subject to undue influences, interests or relationships that will conflict with the best interests of ARE. All applicable laws 
and regulations must be complied with in both form and substance in all transactions and activities. ARE’s accounting and 
financial records must be accurate and complete and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and internal accounting controls must be adhered to at all times. The making of false or misleading entries on such records, 
whether they relate to financial results or expenses, is strictly prohibited. In addition, public disclosures of financial and business 
information must be accurate, timely and in compliance with all laws, regulations and applicable Company policies. Compliance 
with these basic principles directly contributes to the value of ARE, its stature as a public company, and its reputation as a leader 
in its niche. Any employee, officer, director or consultant who may become aware of any known or possible instance of non-
compliance with this Policy has the affirmative duty to promptly disclose such possible non-compliance in accordance with 
procedures described in this Policy.
ARE’S BUSINESS INTEGRITY PRINCIPLES
The following principles and guidelines are provided to assist all ARE employees, officers, directors and consultants in the 
conduct of ARE’s business and operations:
Conflicts of Interest. Conflicts of interest are prohibited. A “conflict of interest” occurs when an individual’s private interest 
interferes with or undermines, or appears to interfere with or undermine, the interests of ARE as a whole.  This can arise when 
an employee, officer, director or consultant takes actions or has interests that make it difficult to perform his or her work 
objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also include obtaining improper personal benefits, or providing improper 
personal benefits to others, as a result of a person’s position with ARE.  For example, a potential conflict of interest could arise 
if an employee causes ARE to hire a vendor in which that same employee or his or her close friend and/or relative has a financial 
interest.
Factors to be considered by an employee, officer, director or consultant in evaluating whether an activity presents a potential 
conflict of interest include:
•  Could my outside business interests affect my job performance or my judgment on behalf of ARE or affect others with 
whom I work?
•  Can I reasonably conduct the activity outside of normal work hours?
•  Will I be using ARE equipment, materials or proprietary or confidential information in my activities?
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  F-76
•  Could the activity have any potential adverse or beneficial impact on ARE’s business or its relationships with tenants, 
partners or other entities with which ARE does business?
•  Could the activity result in personal financial gain or other direct or indirect benefit to me or a member of my immediate 
family at the expense of ARE or its tenants, partners or other entities with which ARE does business?
•  Could the activity appear improper to an outside observer?
Corporate Opportunities. No employee, officer, director or consultant may take personal advantage of any opportunity that 
he or she discovers, or that is presented to him or her, as a result of his or her position with ARE or through access to Company 
information. Similarly, no person subject to this Policy may use ARE property or information or his or her position with ARE 
for personal gain or for any third party’s personal gain.
Loyalty. All employees, officers, directors and consultants have a duty to ARE to advance its legitimate business interests and 
should not compete with ARE, nor should they own an interest in any entity that competes with ARE, other than passive 
investments (i.e., less than 1% of outstanding securities) in publicly traded companies.
Confidentiality. Subject to the specific terms of any Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement between an 
employee and ARE, all confidential and/or proprietary information about ARE and its business or operations that a person 
receives as a result of his or her position with ARE, including information about our tenants and other entities and/or persons 
with whom we do business or come into contact in the course of our work for ARE, should be held in strict confidence, except 
when disclosure of that information is authorized or legally required, and then only if approved by a duly authorized officer of 
ARE. ARE business matters and confidential and/or proprietary information should not be discussed with anyone outside ARE, 
other than ARE’s advisors and other persons who have a legitimate need to know the information and who are under an obligation 
of confidentiality, and should not be discussed in any public place. The obligation to treat certain information as confidential 
does not end when an employee, officer, director or consultant leaves ARE. Accordingly, employees, officers, directors and 
consultants may not disclose any confidential information to a new employer or to others, or use any confidential information, 
after ceasing to be an ARE employee, officer, director or consultant, unless such disclosure or use is expressly authorized in 
advance by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
Fair Dealing. We must all deal fairly with our tenants, vendors and other parties with whom ARE has a business relationship 
and with each other. No one associated with ARE should attempt to take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, 
concealment, abuse of confidential and/or proprietary information, misrepresentation of facts or any other unfair practice.
Protection and Proper Use of ARE Assets. All employees, officers, directors and consultants should protect ARE’s assets and 
use them efficiently and only for legitimate business purposes. Theft, misappropriation, unauthorized disclosures, carelessness 
and waste have a direct impact on ARE’s profitability and are contrary to the interests of ARE and its shareholders. It is important 
that appropriate measures are taken to ensure the security of ARE computers and any computer or voicemail passwords. 
Whenever you use an ARE computer, phone or other communications device to send a text message, e-mail or voicemail or to 
access Internet services, remember that you are acting as a representative of the Company. In addition, all text messages, e-
mail, voicemail and personal files stored on ARE computers, phones and other communications devices are ARE’s property. 
Employees, officers, directors and consultants have no expectation of privacy in connection with these resources. The use of 
electronic systems and other technological resources must be consistent with all other ARE policies, including but not limited 
to those policies relating to systems usage, sexual harassment, privacy and confidential information.
Compliance with Law. All laws, rules and regulations must be complied with, including (without limitation) laws prohibiting 
fraud, embezzlement, and corruption. We expect employees to understand the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to 
their business units and areas of responsibility. You must also comply with the securities laws prohibiting trading on the basis 
of non-public information. Insider trading is both unethical and illegal and will result in prompt disciplinary action by ARE, as 
well as the possibility of regulatory or criminal enforcement actions and private litigation.
Accurate, Fair and Timely Financial Reporting. ARE and each of its employees, officers, directors and consultants are 
responsible for assuring that all reports and other documents that we file with or submit to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission or other government agencies contain full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable financial statements and 
descriptions of ARE’s business. All personnel who are requested to assist in preparing any such reports or other communications, 
including both the collection of information and review of drafts of any such reports or other communications, should do so 
diligently and in full compliance with ARE’s disclosure controls and procedures.
F-77  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Anti-Corruption Compliance.  You are strictly prohibited from engaging in any act or omission that would result in a violation 
of any applicable anti-corruption or kickback law or regulation. The Company does not tolerate the provision or acceptance of 
any improper payments or advantages in relation to its business. Improper benefits can raise significant accounting and internal 
controls concerns for the Company. Violations of these prohibitions can also result in criminal liability for you and the Company. 
You must review and comply with the Company’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Anti-Corruption Policy. You can obtain a 
copy of that policy from the Company’s General Counsel if you do not already have one.
EXCEPTIONS TO POLICY
Waivers of the specific requirements of this Policy will only be approved in exceptional cases in which it is determined that 
the requested waiver would not involve a departure from our fundamental commitment to conducting business in compliance 
with applicable law and the highest ethical standards. Waivers may only be granted by authorized officers or, in the case of any 
waiver involving an executive officer or director, by the Board of Directors or a duly appointed committee of the Board. Any 
waivers of, or amendments or changes to, this Policy involving executive officers or directors of ARE will be disclosed through 
the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K or other authorized method in accordance with applicable law and the rules of the

This Policy is not intended to be a comprehensive rulebook and cannot address every situation you may face. If you feel 
uncomfortable about a situation or have any doubts about whether it is consistent with ARE’s ethical standards, we encourage 
you to seek help. We suggest you contact your supervisor for help first. If your supervisor cannot answer your question or if 
you do not feel comfortable contacting your supervisor, please contact the General Counsel or the Chairperson of the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors. The email address for the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
is rklein@are.com.
REPORTING OF EVENTS OF KNOWN OR POSSIBLE NON-COMPLIANCE
Facts or events that directly or indirectly conflict with the proper application of this Policy could adversely affect the value and 
reputation of ARE. Each employee, officer, director and consultant shares in the responsibility for ensuring compliance with 
this Policy and conducting herself or himself in a manner that is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, the 
highest ethical standards, this Policy and other Company policies and procedures.
Should an employee, officer, director or consultant become aware of any known or possible instance of non-compliance with 
this Policy, the employee, officer, director or consultant has the affirmative duty to promptly report such possible non-compliance 
to her/his supervisor, local management, the General Counsel or the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Directors. An employee, officer, director or consultant must promptly report any complaint he or she may have or receive from 
any employee, officer, director or consultant or any client or other person regarding material accounting, internal accounting 
controls or auditing matters. Any such reports made will be forwarded to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board 
of Directors. If you believe that the person to whom you have reported material non-compliance with this Policy has not taken 
appropriate action, you should contact the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors directly. The email 
address for the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is rklein@are.com.
Violation of this Policy, and failure to report material non-compliance with this Policy, may be detrimental to ARE and will 
subject the employee, officer, director or consultant to disciplinary action, up to and including termination or removal. In some 
instances, civil or criminal proceedings may be pursued.
It is most helpful if you identify yourself and provide contact information when reporting any instance of possible non-compliance 
with this Policy so that ARE may contact you if further information is needed to pursue an investigation. All information 
provided will be kept confidential to the extent practicable under the circumstances (including as consistent with the needs of 
a thorough investigation). If you are uncomfortable providing your identity, you may also anonymously disclose instances of 
possible non-compliance with this Policy by submitting your concerns in writing to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee 
or the General Counsel. In either case, an employee, officer, director or consultant who discloses instances of possible 
noncompliance should keep all information related to the matter in strict confidence and not discuss such information with 
anyone other than ARE officials conducting the investigation or other persons authorized by them, except as required by 
applicable law.
  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  F-78
If you are involved in an event of non-compliance with this Policy, the fact that you voluntarily report such non-compliance in 
good faith, together with the degree of cooperation displayed by you and whether the non-compliance was intentional or 
unintentional, will be given appropriate consideration by ARE in its investigation and any resulting disciplinary action.
INVESTIGATIONS OF POSSIBLE EVENTS OF NON-COMPLIANCE
All reports concerning possible events of non-compliance with this Policy will be promptly, fairly and independently investigated 
and will be treated confidentially to the extent practicable under the circumstances.
It is imperative that persons disclosing possible non-compliance with this Policy not attempt to conduct their own 
investigations. Investigations may involve complex legal issues. Acting on one’s own may compromise the integrity of ARE’s 
investigation and adversely affect both the employee, officer, director or consultant and ARE. However, measures should be 
taken promptly to preserve documents and other items relevant to any investigation.
Employees, officers, directors and consultants are expected to cooperate in the investigation of any possible non-compliance 
with this Policy. If the result of the investigation indicates that corrective action is required, ARE will decide what steps it should 
take to rectify the problem and avoid its recurrence.
The Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors will lead any required investigation and, if deemed necessary, 
appoint additional individuals to assist in the process. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee will coordinate the investigation, 
findings and recommendations  with  ARE  management  and,  if  appropriate, the Talent Management & Operations Department 
before action is taken and the file is closed. The Chairperson of the Audit Committee will report the status and results of any 
reports received and any resulting investigation to the Audit Committee, which will then take appropriate action with respect 
to the matter.
If a report of an instance of possible non-compliance with this Policy involves an individual who would normally participate 
in an investigation, that individual generally will not be notified of the investigation, except as may be necessary to conduct a 
full and fair investigation of the facts, and such individual will not be allowed to participate in conducting or reviewing the 
investigation.
All information obtained during an investigation shall be considered confidential and shall be disseminated only on a need-to-
know basis, unless otherwise required by law. No information relating to an investigation shall be disposed of or destroyed 
without the prior written approval of the Chairperson of the Audit Committee and the General Counsel.
It is ARE’s objective that all investigations be completed and resolved promptly and, if possible, within 60 days of the Company’s 
receipt of the complaint.
RETALIATION NOT PERMITTED
Retaliation against any person who in good faith reports any instance of non-compliance or possible non-compliance with this 
Policy or any potential violation of law, who assists another to make a good faith report, or who participates in good faith in 
an investigation of a report, is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. This includes (without limitation) retaliation relating 
to reports or complaints received from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters relating 
to ARE or any concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing. This policy also protects those individuals who cooperate 
in investigations conducted by ARE or any government agency, or who provide information concerning suspected non-
compliance or legal violations. In addition, ARE prohibits retaliation against any person who refuses to participate in an act 
that would result in a violation of state or federal statute, rule or regulation, or who reports any suspected violations of law at 
a former employer. Any instance of retaliation will result in prompt disciplinary action, up to and including termination of 
employment with ARE, in addition to any penalty or liability under applicable law. However, any person who makes a report 
known to be false or provides information known to be false may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination 
or removal.
OBLIGATIONS OF EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS
Read and understand the Policy. Employees, officers, directors and consultants are expected to read and understand this Policy 
and comply fully with its terms. Please discuss any questions you may have regarding this Policy with your direct supervisor 
or the General Counsel to ensure that you understand the Policy.
F-79  ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE EQUITIES, INC.
Follow the Policy. Employees, officers, directors and consultants must act in accordance with this Policy. ARE may periodically 
require employees, officers, directors and consultants to certify in writing their compliance with this Policy.
Report known or possible violations of the Policy. If you become aware of known or possible instances of non-compliance 
with this Policy, you must report such instances to your supervisor, local management, the General Counsel or the Chairperson 
of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (anonymously or otherwise), as appropriate. In addition, you may report 
suspected violations of law to the California Attorney General or other state or federal agencies, or foreign government authorities 
that have competent jurisdiction over ARE at any time.

SAFE HARBOR: This document includes “forward-looking statements” within 
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-
looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our 2019 
earnings per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, 
2019 funds from operations per share attributable to Alexandria’s common 
stockholders – diluted, net operating income, our projected sources and uses of 
capital, and our 2025 sustainability goals. You can identify the forward-looking 
statements by their use of forward-looking words, such as “forecast,” “guidance,” 
“projects,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “goals,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” 
“may,” “plans,” “seeks,” “should,” or “will,” or the negative of those words or 
similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our current 
expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events 
or trends, and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts, 
as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events. There can be no 
assurance that actual results will not be materially higher or lower than these 
expectations. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, 
and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that 
might cause such a difference include, without limitation, our failure to obtain 
capital (debt, construction financing, and/or equity) or refinance debt maturities, 
increased interest rates and operating costs, adverse economic or real estate 
developments in our markets, our failure to successfully place into service 
and lease any properties undergoing development or redevelopment and our 
existing space held for future development or redevelopment (including new 
properties acquired for that purpose), our failure to fully realize our sustainability 
goals within the projected timeline, our failure to successfully operate or lease 
acquired properties, decreased rental rates, increased vacancy rates or failure to 
renew or replace expiring leases, defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants, 
adverse general and local economic conditions, an unfavorable capital market 
environment, decreased leasing activity or lease renewals, and other risks and 
uncertainties detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(“SEC”). Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such 
forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of 
the date of this report, and unless otherwise stated, we assume no obligation to 
update this information and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise 
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future 
events, or otherwise. For more discussion relating to risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our 
forward-looking statements, and risks to our business in general, please refer to
