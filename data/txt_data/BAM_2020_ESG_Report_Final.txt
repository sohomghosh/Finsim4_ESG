INTRODUCTION
While also the right thing to put our capital behind, we believe that the transition 
to net zero is an exceptional commercial opportunity. And while this global goal 
of net zero is an ambitious one, it is also an imperative one. We are excited about 
what this strategy can accomplish, and we intend to take a leadership role in 
powering the transition of the global economy for everyone.
These are just some of the plans we have for Brookfield in the years ahead. In 
achieving these, we recognize that our people remain the foundation of our 
ability to succeed. We continue to focus on diversity, and in 2020 we expanded 
our focus beyond gender to include ethnic diversity. This expansion included the 
creation of a Global Diversity Advisory Group. The mandate of this group is to 
provide insight into the concerns, challenges and successes around attracting 
and retaining members of underrepresented groups within the communities in 
which we operate, starting with increasing representation from the Black 
community in North America. 
We believe that a workforce encompassing and encouraging varied backgrounds 
and perspectives reinforces our culture and enhances collaboration. Our culture 
is an important foundation for our success and reinforcing it as we continue to 
expand is a priority. 
We remain focused on our goal of generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our 
investors, and in doing so with long-term, positive outcomes for society. We have 
consistently found that value creation and sustainable business practices are 
complementary goals. This view has been reinforced by what we have learned 
throughout our 100-plus years as an owner operator, and we expect this to 
continue to be true over the next 100 years as we work to secure a sustainable 
future for all.

INTRODUCTION
Who We Are
We are a leading global alternative asset manager with over $600 billion of assets 
under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private 
equity and credit.
Our Business
We focus on investing long-life, high-quality assets and businesses that form the backbone of the global 
economy. We have a broad selection of investment products, including private funds and publicly listed that 
enable both institutions and individuals to invest in assets and businesses that we own and operate. Our goal 
is to enable these businesses, as well as the communities in which we operate, to thrive over the long term. 
We have developed strong operating capabilities over the years, which are important to reinforcing sustainable 
operations. We are one of the world’s largest owners and operators of real estate, and we own the world’s 
largest private sector renewable power-generating business. We also own a diverse array of infrastructure 
businesses and other privately held companies that deliver essential products and services to our communities, 
for which longevity and stability of operations are essential. We are a pre-eminent manager of private debt 
and public securities. 
Our financial discipline and access to large-scale capital are integral to our investment approach. Our access to 
multiple sources of capital—from our own balance sheet, our publicly listed affiliates’ capital and capital from our 
institutional and private wealth investors—gives us the ability to pursue large-scale opportunities that generate 
attractive financial returns and cash flows and support the growth of our asset management activities.
Finally, we invest significant capital alongside our investors, which creates a strong alignment of interests 
with our investors.

and our approach to long-term compensation encourage collaboration—not 
just across our global asset management business, but also with and among 
our portfolio companies. This shows itself in a number of ways, including in 
the sharing of expertise and best practices through both formal and informal 
channels and building relationships and capabilities through employee 
secondments and transfers. 
These principles inform how we manage the business and are foundational to 
our success. Our approach to ESG is consistent with these principles.

In addition, several of our businesses and portfolio companies are members 
of organizations associated with their respective businesses and part of 
industry-specific frameworks enabling them to further their ESG initiatives. 
For example, many of our real estate businesses voluntarily disclose 
environmental performance annually through participation in the Global 
Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). These businesses include our 
core office and certain of our retail businesses. GRESB is an investor-driven 
organization assessing the sustainability performance of real asset sector

About This Report
This report covers the Firm’s ESG-related activities between 
January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, unless noted otherwise. 
In determining the most important issues to our stakeholders and the industry, 
we referred to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards 
for Asset Management and Custody Activities and the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI), which we believe provide best practice guidance on ESG disclosures most 
meaningful for our business. We continue to align our climate-related corporate 
reporting with the recommendations of the TCFD, building up to a formal report 
for the 2022 reporting year. 
These three disclosure frameworks, along with input from our stakeholders, 
informed our views on the topics that are most important to Brookfield. We identified 
17 topics as material to the long-term success and resiliency of our businesses and 
organized them for this report in four areas: Our Investment Approach; Our People; 
Corporate Governance and Ethics; and Building A Better World.

Human Capital  
Development
We value our people and support their long-term success 
by seeking opportunities for them to grow and develop 
professionally. This reinforces strong succession and ensures 
we maintain an engaged workforce.
Our employees drive our success and ensure we deliver on our commitments to 
investors and other stakeholders. We seek to create a positive, open and inclusive 
work environment that enables employees to develop. Inclusive leadership and 
disciplined talent management processes are critical to our success in this regard.
Inclusive leadership starts with a strong tone at the top. Our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics and Positive Work Environment Policy set a consistently high 
standard for how we interact with one another and reinforce a work environment 
conducive to learning and development. To accomplish this, we focus on 
developing our people leaders: 
  Ensure the mandate of a people leader is clear: to provide a work environment 
that is conducive to learning and development and in which people feel safe 
when stepping outside their comfort zone. This is critical to our success in 
developing our people. 
  Provide training which clearly outlines the key elements of an environment that 
supports development. 
  Provide feedback to our people leaders to enhance their development. In early 
2020, we piloted a 360-feedback process to give people leaders information on 
how to improve their effectiveness in leading their teams.
In the recent 360-feedback survey, over 87% of 
respondents ranked people leaders positively or very 
positively in each element of our leadership framework

COVID-19
At Brookfield, the health and safety of our employees has always been a priority 
and continued to be a focus during 2020 as we managed through the COVID-19 
pandemic. In each office, as soon as it was permissible and subject to each 
individual’s personal health and other considerations, we brought our employees 
back into the office. This was important to reinforce our culture of collaboration, 
enable the development of our employees and benefit mental health. Four key 
principles were followed to accomplish this safely: adherence to local requirements, 
implementing strong safety protocols—often exceeding government requirements, 
risk mitigation through continuous monitoring of protocols and respect for each 
employee’s privacy. The safety protocols included installation of glass partitions 
between workspaces and other distancing measures, daily health screening, access 
to free COVID testing, increased sanitation and clear protocols for addressing 
situations where an employee contracted COVID. Our protocols were successful  
at preventing transmission within our offices.

against the dual objectives of attractive financial returns and a positive societal impact. 
MARK CARNEY, BROOKFIELD VICE CHAIR, 
The Fund will target investments across three primary themes: 
HEAD OF ESG & IMPACT FUND INVESTING
1.  Business Transformation: transition utility, energy, and industrial businesses driving carbon 
dioxide equivalent reduction and decreased energy consumption through investment in 
greener production processes and energy efficiency. This will include investments in  
non-pure-play renewable opportunities, utility companies, industrial, and energy efficiency 
technologies such as smart meters and electric vehicle charging stations. 
2.  Clean Energy: aid in the development and accessibility of renewable energy sources. This 
will include hydroelectricity, wind and solar development, green hydrogen, battery storage, 
electrical grid and distribution, and smart grids.
3.  Sustainable Solutions: solutions that drive the growth of a circular economy in areas such as 
waste management, resource efficiency and the development of resilient infrastructure. This 
will include heating and cooling, clean water concessions, waste management technology, 
recycling, and waste/sewage utilities. 
Brookfield expects that investments 
made by the Fund will also align with 
a number of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) 
Brookfield is committed to managing the Fund in a manner that furthers the goals of the Paris 
Agreement. In doing so, it will utilize an impact measurement and management approach that 
aligns with leading global standards and will provide reportable quantitative impact results that 
can be integrated into investors’ individual ESG and impact plans.

“estimates,” “seeks,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “forecasts” or negative versions thereof, or future or conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would” and “could.” 
Although Brookfield believes that the anticipated future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements are based upon 
reasonable assumptions and expectations in light of information available at the time such statement is or was made, reliance should not be placed on forward-looking 
statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including Brookfield’s ability to identify, measure, monitor and control risks 
across Brookfield’s entire business operations, including its portfolio companies, which may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially.

otherwise. None of Brookfield, its officers, employees, agents, or affiliates makes any express or implied representation, warranty or undertaking with respect to the 
accuracy, reasonableness, or completeness of any of the information contained herein, including without limitation, information obtained from portfolio companies or other
