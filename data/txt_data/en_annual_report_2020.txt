(1)  This amount is the pro forma equivalent dividend on a full year basis for 2017, in relation to the shorter financial year of 2017 following the change of year end from March to December.
(2) Rothschild & Co would normally have proposed for approval at the respective General Meetings a dividend of €0.85 per share in respect of our 2019 results and €0.89 per share in respect 
of our 2020 results. However, following the recommendations of the ACPR during 2020 and 2021, no dividend was paid in 2020 and the dividend we will propose to the General Meeting on 
24 May 2021 will be restricted to €0.70 per share. It is, however, the intention to pay the remaining amount of €1.04 per share in the form of an exceptional interim dividend in respect of 
the 2021 financial year, as and when the regulator so allows, which the Group currently expects to be in fourth quarter of 2021, in the absence of materially adverse developments.
(3) Exceptional block trades over 500,000 shares.

Five Arrows Minority Investments 
(FAMI)
FAMI is the division’s co-investment strategy, investing 
alongside a proprietary network of international fund 
managers. It has deployed over €500 million of capital 
in more than 80 transactions since the 1990s, mainly 
in growth capital and buy-out opportunities across North 
America, Europe and emerging markets.
In conjunction with the investment activities carried out 
directly on the Group’s balance sheet, the FAMI team also 
manages three co-investment programmes (R&Co Private 
Opportunities I & II, and FAMI III) structured as investment 
clubs. These programmes were originally launched in 
2013 as a joint initiative between the Merchant Banking 
and Wealth Management divisions of Rothschild & Co for 
the exclusive benefit of key relationships of the Group.
In 2020, the team completed the first two transactions 
of its third co-investment programme, FAMI III. The first 
transaction was a minority stake in Engineering, an Italian 
IT systems integrator and software provider. In Q4 2020, 
the team completed the second transaction, acquiring  
a stake in Softway Medical, through the syndication  
of a minority holding held by Naxicap Partners. 
As at 31 December 2020, the Net Asset Value of the 
Group’s investments in FAMI was €110 million. 
In June 2020, FAMI team completed the disposal 
of minority stake in Ave Point, the leading US

FAMI originally invested in Ave Point in October

Five Arrows Debt Partners III (FADP III)
In Q4 2019, the team started the fundraising process  
for its third European direct lending fund, FADP III.  
During 2020, the fund had secured c. €640 million  
of commitments with fundraising still ongoing.
FADP III is highly complementary to FACS and FADL and 
capitalises on the significant debt financing appetite of 
mid-sized corporates, as banks continue to retreat from 
the market due to regulatory and capital constraints.
The strong market demand, combined with the extent of 
the team’s sourcing network and deal flow, has allowed 
FADP III to deploy its capital rapidly in 2020: to date 
the fund has invested 39% of its committed capital 
in six transactions, three of which were completed in 
conjunction with FADL. 
As at 31 December 2020, the value of the Group’s 
investment in FADP III was €22 million.
In November 2020, FADP III provided an  
£85 million (c. €96 million) unitranche loan to

For 2020, administrative expenses were €255 million (2019: €289 million)

expenses of €2 million.
As mentioned in the 2019 annual report of Rothschild & Co, the Group 
moved to a new IT infrastructure supplier to enable it to accelerate the 
implementation of its operational programmes. This has resulted in a 
one-off transition and transformation charge of €15 million in 2020.

1.3.5 Non-controlling interests
For 2020, the charge for Non-controlling interests was €148 million (2019: €154 million). This mainly comprises interest on perpetual subordinated 
debt and profit share (préciput) payable to French partners in line with the performance of the French GA and WAM businesses.
1.4  Business activities
Please refer to Chapter 2. “Business review” of this report.
1.5  Financial structure
Rothschild & Co, as a financial holding company (compagnie financière holding), is supervised by the ACPR on a consolidated basis. The Group has a 
solid balance sheet with Shareholder’s equity – Group share as at 31 December 2020 of €2.3 billion (2019: €2.2 billion). This increase reflects the 
retained profit for the year partly offset by losses in reserves relating to actuarial valuations and translation losses from exchange rate fluctuations.
The CET 1 ratio was 20.1%(1) as at 31 December 2020 which reduced from prior year (2019: 20.2%) The fully loaded Common Equity Tier 1 capital 
is calculated in accordance with applicable CRR/CRD4 rules. The fully loaded solvency ratios are presented pro forma for current profits(2), net of 
dividends, for the current financial year, unless specified otherwise.

(*)  CCB: Capital Conservation Buffer.
(**) The ratios as at 31 December 2019 have been recalculated to reflect the cancellation of the 2019 dividend, in accordance with the ACPR’s recommendation.
High levels of liquidity are maintained with cash and treasury assets accounting for 59% of the total assets of €14.7 billion (2019: 59%). Lending 
remains conservatively funded by customer deposits with a loan to deposit ratio of 35% as at 31 December 2020 (2019: 34%).
Cash generation remains good with Operating Cash Flow (OCF)(3) of €90 million (2019: €116 million). The reduction versus 2019 is due to the 
significant cash inflow generated on property disposals during 2019. It should be noted that the OCF is particularly dependent on the level of 
realisations and investments within the Merchant Banking business in any particular year. OCF excluding Merchant Banking investment activities  
was €121 million (2019: €138 million). 
Net book value per share was €31.90 (2019: €31.23) and net tangible book value per share was €27.67 (2019: €27.07).
1.6  Alternative performance measures
To enhance the presentation of its operating performance, Rothschild & Co uses the following alternative performance measures in its communication.
(1) The ratio submitted to ACPR as at 31 December 2020 was 19.5%, which excludes the profit of the second half of the year.
(2) Subject to the provisions of article 26.2 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

The main change in the Company’s assets between 2019 and 2020 concerns the receipt of €121.8 million of dividends in the year, which has  ts
helped the cash balance to rise by €100 million.
The main changes in the Company’s liabilities between 2019 and 2020 concern:
  the repayment of €70 million of loans; and
  an additional provision for contingencies, which relates to a possible expense of €11.4 million linked to the exercise of stock options.
The Company received dividends of €121.8 million from its French subsidiaries (Paris Orléans Holding Bancaire: €73.9 million; K Développement: 
€38.6 million; Martin Maurel: €7.3 million and Rothschild Martin Maurel: €2.1 million), versus €345.2 million in 2019.
The increase in operating income of €1.4 million mainly corresponds to recharged operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses mainly 
corresponds to higher general and administration costs of €4.1 million. Lastly, the loss from capital transactions of €18.1 million is mainly explained 
by the €11.4 million provision for contingencies, net losses on Rothschild & Co treasury shares relating to the Equity Schemes of €1.7 million, and 
impairment of portfolio investments of €4.6 million.

(2) For more information about the dividend for the 2019 financial year, please refer to Section 2.4 “Dividends distributed by the Company over the past three financial years” below.
(3) Dividend proposed for the 2020 financial year is subject to the approval of the General Meeting to be held on 20 May 2021.
2.3  Proposed appropriation of income for the 2020 financial year
Rothschild & Co would normally have proposed for approval at the respective General Meetings a dividend of €0.85 per share in respect of the  
2019 results and €0.89 per share in respect of the 2020 results. However, following the recommendations of the ACPR during 2020 and 2021,  
no dividend was paid in 2020 and the dividend that will propose to the General Meeting in May 2021 will be restricted to €0.70 per share.
It is however the intention to pay the remaining amount of €1.04 per share in the form of an exceptional interim dividend in respect of the 2021 
financial year, as and when the regulator so allows, which the Group currently expects to be in fourth quarter of 2021, in the absence of materially 
adverse developments.
Therefore, the Managing Partner will propose to the General Meeting that the income for the 2020 financial year be appropriated as follows:
In euros 31/12/2020 31/12/2019
Net income for the financial year 84,497,124 309,401,389
Appropriation to the legal reserve (8,000) (20,947)
Credit retained earnings 516,541,927 209,757,174
Distributable profit 601,031,051 519,137,616
Profit share (préciput) allocated to the General Partners(1) (3,005,155) (2,595,688)
Appropriation
to the payment of a dividend per share of €0.70 54,360,258(2) –
to retained earnings 543,665,637 516,541,928
(1) For more information, please refer to page 60 of this report.
(2) The total amount of the distribution referred to above is calculated based on the number of shares making up the share capital as at 31 December 2020 (i.e. 77,657,512 shares) and may 
vary if the number of shares entitled to a dividend changes between 1 January 2021 and the ex-dividend date, depending in particular on changes in the number of treasury shares, which do 
not entitle to a dividend according to French law.

The Company’s net income amounts to €84,497,124 for the 2020 financial year (€309,401,389 for the 2019 financial year).
This net income, less the amount of €8,000 assigned to the legal reserve and plus retained earnings of €516,541,927 makes a distributable net 
profit of €601,031,051 for the 2020 financial year (€519,137,616 for the 2019 financial year).
In accordance with the provisions of the Company’s articles of association, in the event of an annual distributable profit, a profit share (préciput) 
equal to 0.5% of the annual distributable profit is automatically allocated to the General Partners who held such position during the relevant year. 
In this context, an amount of €3,005,155 (€2,595,688 for the 2019 financial year) will be automatically allocated for payment to the two General 
Partners, Rothschild & Co Gestion and Rothschild & Co Commandité for the 2020 financial year. 
The payment of a dividend of €0.70 per share will be submitted for approval to the General Meeting to be held on 20 May 2021. The ex-dividend 
date would be 24 May 2021 and the dividend payment date would be 26 May 2021.

(3) On 10 March 2020, Rothschild & Co announced its intention to propose a dividend of €0.85 per share in respect of 2019 to the General Meeting. However, in the context of the COVID-19  rt
epidemic and following the announcement by the European Central Bank on 27 March 2020, recommending that dividend payments and commitments by credit and similar institutions within 
the European Union are stopped until 1 October 2020, the Managing Partner decided that no dividend would be distributed to the shareholders in respect of 2019, while indicating that it 
was its intention to pay the previously announced dividend of €0.85 per share when appropriate. 
  Following a subsequent announcement by the ACPR on 28 July 2020, relating to the extension until 1 January 2021 of the recommendation that dividend payments by financial institutions 
should not be made, the Managing Partner decided that no dividend will be distributed to shareholders during the 2020 financial year. 
  The Managing Partner reiterated its intention to pay the previously announced of €0.85 per share when appropriate. Both corresponding press releases, respectively dated 31 March 2020 
and 29 July 2020, are available on the Company’s website (www.rothschildandco.com).
(4) As authorised by the General Meeting of 16 May 2019 in its 2nd resolution, the Managing Partner revised the final amount of the actual distribution as treasury shares held by the Company 
on the payment date were not entitled to a dividend; the amount of the dividend corresponding to these shares was automatically added to retained earnings. The dividend has been payable 
on 22 May 2019.

as this person acts in concert with RCSAS): where a party to the Rothschild & Co Shareholders’ Agreement wishes to transfer all or any part of 
Rothschild & Co shares, the selling party shall, before any transfer, offer to RCSAS the Rothschild & Co shares he/she/it intends to transfer. 
RCSAS may then exercise its right of first refusal regarding part or all the offered Rothschild & Co shares. In contrast, RCSAS shall remain free  
to transfer Rothschild & Co shares any time and under the terms and conditions it deems appropriate; and
  the parties to the Rothschild & Co Shareholders’ Agreement shall make their best effort to reach a consensus regarding the exercise of 
their voting rights during Rothschild & Co’s General Meetings. If a consensus could not be reached, the parties undertake to vote along the

2.3.2 Other shareholders’ agreements
In June 2012, the Group implemented a reorganization as part of which certain former general partners of Rothschild Martin Maurel SCS (formerly 
named Rothschild et Compagnie Banque SCS) and shareholders of Financière Rabelais SAS (together, the “Contributors”) transferred their 
respective interests in these entities to Rothschild & Co in exchange for Rothschild & Co shares. 
In the context of this reorganization, RCSAS and the Contributors entered into lock-up agreements which require the Contributors to hold all of the 
Rothschild & Co shares received in exchange for these contributions for lock-up periods ranging from one to 18 years and to notify Rothschild & Co 
and RCSAS before any sale of said shares. The Contributors do not all participate in the Enlarged Family Concert.

conditional upon the achievement of a performance condition which 
depends on the entity within which the participant is a Partner or the 
status of the Partner.
The Exercise Price is determined by the Managing Partner of the 
Company at the grant date in accordance with Articles L.22-10-56 and 
L.225-179 of the French Commercial Code, the applicable resolutions 
of the General Meeting authorising the Managing Partner to grant stock 
options, and the Equity Scheme rules and regulations.

executive roles. These shares, intended to be delivered to holders of RSUs, at the end of the vesting period and subject to certain conditions, are controlling shares and therefore are 
deprived of the capacity to exercise the voting rights attached to them until the vesting date.

D. Corporate Responsibility
1.2.3 Identification of non-financial risks 
As disclosed in the Group’s Annual Report 2019, Rothschild & Co undertook a thorough assessment of Corporate Responsibility issues in 2018/19. 
The aim was to identify the most critical environmental, governance and social issues that are relevant to the Group’s stakeholders and which could 
represent non-financial risks or opportunities for its businesses. 
In recognition of the increased and shifting stakeholder interest in Corporate Responsibility matters, the Group carried out a review off this 
assessment of non-financial risks affecting its businesses and stakeholders alongside the annual review of strategic risks for the Group at the  
end of 2020. The results of this review are summarised in the below matrix:

Sections 2 and 3 provide an overview of the Group’s strategic objectives in each of its Corporate Responsibility priority areas and the relevant 
policies and developments in 2020 aimed at managing identified non-financial risks in its operations, as well as initiatives addressing associated 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in the Group’s business divisions. 
(1) Methodology: consultation of most recent secondary data sources paired with internal expert consultation lead to an update of a long list of micro-issues related to Corporate Responsibility 
and respective categories that might present non-financial risks and / or opportunities for the firm and its stakeholders. Followed by a risk assessment in consultation with internal experts 
and calibration with Group Risk and responsible members of the senior management team the results of the materiality assessment were approved by the Group Executive Committee in 
December 2020, and considered by the CR Committee and Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board.

D. Corporate Responsibility
In 2020, the Group has additionally been able to support 138 charities 
through pro-bono advisory webinars, including one focusing on the HR 
challenges posed by COVID-19 and another on the future of the UK retail 
landscape for those charities with a significant high street presence. 
Additionally, more than 20 senior bankers attended virtual funding 
panels during the year to help assess funding applications from start-up 
charities and social enterprises.
2.4.5 Outlook 
The Group’s strategy for engaging with the social sector in 2021 will  
take account of the learnings and changing environment in 2020. 
Whilst in 2020 the Group experienced a high degree of employee 
engagement for a broader range of causes with 34% of employees 
engaging in either employee giving or volunteering support (or both) 
organised at local level, the year has also highlighted the opportunity 
to help address some of the most pressing societal as well as 
environmental challenges in collaboration with the social sector. 
At the time of publication of this report the Group is reorganising its 
philanthropic and volunteering initiatives to ensure their alignment 
with the Group’s Corporate Responsibility strategy, supporting social 
enterprises and charities that work to fight against social and economic 
inequalities and help protect the planet for future generations. The 
revised approach will allow the firm to draw on the full extent of the 
Group-wide business expertise and the enthusiasm of its people, 
and seeks to improve the lives of the next generation by supporting 
initiatives aimed at: 
  addressing barriers to equality such as income, race and gender; 
  protecting the planet by helping to mitigate the risks of climate 
change and biodiversity loss.

D. Corporate Responsibility
Scope 1 emission remained relatively stable, but Scope 2 market-based emission decreased due to French offices procuring renewable electricity 
contracts, which resulted in a c. 400 tCOe reduction from 2019. 
2
Business travel was significantly affected by COVID-related travel restrictions, as a result a c. 14,500 tCOe has been realised from 2019.
2
IT equipment and server-related emissions have increased due mainly to an increased roll-out of hardware (laptops, screens, etc) to enable more 
efficient homeworking.

Total disposal tonnes/FTE 0.19  0.17 0.10 
Total materials sent for disposal has decreased significantly, due mainly to reduced office occupancy levels across the Group. Other contributing 
factors to a reduced recycling rate (39% in 2020 vs. 50% in 2019) was the reduction in high volume / heavy items (predominately paper, glass, and 
compostable material) being produced. For example, in the London office, a significant producer of recyclable material, the rates of recycling paper, 
glass and compostable material fell to zero for six months between April and November.

Rothschild & Co understands that applying a traditional approach to resources use can place undue pressure on global resources, is wasteful 
and not economically viable in an increasingly challenging business environment. To that end, the Group ensures that it manages its resource use 
responsibly and as far as practicable.
Materials use predominately means paper use, although an increase in reporting scope over the years has resulted in more material types being  3
added. The Group measures the amount of 100% recycled and sustainably sourced paper it procures (certified sustainable paper from FSC or PEFC).  . M

A.4.4. Amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental risk
Rothschild & Co undertook a legal compliance and conformance assessment to understand the legal environmental responsibilities in each 
jurisdiction where Rothschild & Co has an office. This assessment led to the development of the Group environmental conformance standard for 
offices worldwide, and which the Group regularly monitors and uses to improve continuously.
Provisions have been identified in order to meet European Union (EU) energy efficiency obligations relevant to EU member states. Provisions in 
the United Kingdom have been identified for operational environmental risk, pertaining to the outgoing CRC energy efficiency scheme (formerly the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment) and the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SERC) scheme.
As an office-based business, Rothschild & Co does not consider environmental discharges to air, water, soil or indeed noise pollution to be of 
material environmental risk.

The recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code not applied by the Company are described in the table below, with an explanation for each of them:
Afep-Medef recommendations Explanations
Proportion of independent members on the Audit Committee  As at 31 December 2020, the Audit Committee comprises three independent members 
(§16.1) out of five members, i.e. 60% of independent members, a proportion slightly below  
the proportion of two thirds recommended by the Afep-Medef Code. However, the

composition ensures that the Remuneration and Nomination Committee effectively

General Meeting held on 16 May 2019: the maximum amount of €600,000 was not in line with the remuneration policy revised and approved by the Supervisory Board at its meeting  
of 12 March 2019. As a consequence, after the Supervisory Board took note of such material error, Mr. David de Rothschild elected to waive the portion of his remuneration as Chairman  
of the Supervisory Board in excess of the maximum amount of €600,000 (see also Rothschild & Co 2019 Annual Report, pages 108 and 111).

representative of various business lines of Rothschild & Co in France: Global Advisory, Wealth and Asset Management and support functions. 
CONTINUING POPULATION 
A continuing population has been considered, i.e. employees (excluding expatriates, interns and apprentices), if they were employed on 1 January  
of the relevant financial year (“N”) and were part of the bonus eligible population at the end of that relevant financial year (“N”).

(valued at their IFRS value); 
  employee savings schemes (profit sharing and incentive schemes); and
  benefits in kind.
Severance, termination and non-competition indemnities due or awarded to employees are excluded.

Code, which have been entered into during the 2020 financial year, directly or indirectly, between a Rothschild & Co SCA related party and a company

5.3  Evaluation process of the agreements relating to ordinary transactions and 
entered into under normal terms and conditions 
Pursuant to the provisions of Article L.22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code, the Supervisory Board is required to set up an evaluation process 
assessing whether the agreements deemed as relating to ordinary transactions and entered into under normal terms and conditions meet these 
conditions.
During its meeting on 10 March 2020, the Supervisory Board considered the evaluation process put in place before the coming into force of the 
provisions of Article L.22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code.
Each time a potential regulated agreement within the meaning of Article L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code is concluded, amended or 
renewed, the Legal department of the Company is in charge of assessing, in liaison with the Group Finance and/or Tax departments, whether such  2
. B
agreement meets two conditions: it is related to an ordinary transaction and it is entered into under normal terms and conditions. The persons who  u
s
are directly or indirectly interested in the agreement are not involved in the process.  in
e
s
s
If an agreement does not qualify as an agreement relating to ordinary transactions and entered into under normal terms and conditions, it is then   re
v
submitted to the approval procedure provided by Articles L.225-38 and seq. of the French Commercial Code. ie
w
The Legal department of the Company uses the following cumulative criteria to assess if an agreement as relating to ordinary transactions and 
entered into under normal terms and conditions do meet these conditions: 
  the agreement relates to ordinary transactions, i.e. transactions that the Company usually carries out in the normal course of its business.  
The following criteria may be considered in assessing whether the agreement related to ordinary transaction or no: its repetition over time,  
the circumstances surrounding its conclusion, its legal significance, its economic consequences, and its duration; and
  the agreement is entered into normal terms and conditions, i.e. under the same conditions as usually practiced by the Company with third parties 
or by other companies operating in the same business line. The following criteria may be considered in assessing whether the agreement is 
entered into normal terms and conditions: the market price/practices and the general balance of the terms and conditions under which the 
agreement is concluded.
3
An agreement is also deemed as relating to ordinary transactions and entered into normal terms and conditions when it is entered into by the  . M
Company and a company wholly hold, either directly or indirectly, by the Company.  a
n
a
g
Provided the above-mentioned criteria are met, the Legal department verifies whether the examined agreement falls into one of the pre-defined  e
m
categories of agreements which are deemed as relating to ordinary transactions and entered into normal terms and conditions. en
For instance, the following agreements have been deemed as relating to ordinary transactions and entered normal terms and conditions:  t rep
o
  agreements with low financial stakes, provided that the agreement is not of significant importance to contracting parties involved; and rt
  intra-Group agreements relating to the following transactions: 
{{provision of services (in particular human resources, IT, management, communication, finance, legal and accounting services); 
{{assistance with financing and re-invoicing of financial instruments; 
{{cash management or loan operations;
{{tax integration known as “neutral” (insofar as it explicitly provides the modalities leading to neutrality, not only during the lifetime of the 
integration but also at the time of leaving the regime); 
{{acquisitions or sales of insignificant assets or securities;
{{acquisitions or sales of receivables; 
{{transfer or loan of Company shares to a corporate officer in the performance of its duties; and
4
{{facilities granted by an entity, once expenses have been invoiced at cost plus a margin to cover unallocated indirect costs, if any. . F
in
This list is non exhaustive, and the presumption may be rebutted if the examined agreement was concluded under exceptional terms and conditions. an
c
ia
All the agreements that have been qualified as relating to ordinary transactions and entered into under normal terms and conditions are reviewed by  l s
the Legal department of the Company on a regular basis, in particular when there are indications that the above-mentioned qualification criteria and/ tate
m
or categories of unregulated agreements may need to be revised. e

1  Highlights
1.1  COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic, and the action taken by governments around the world to tackle its effects, have created a significant amount of 
uncertainty, and the consequences and duration of the impacts are still unclear. This makes the exercise of judgment for accounting estimates 
particularly difficult for the current accounting period, and increases the range of uncertainty for the figures reported.
A summary of how the impact of the pandemic has been considered in making these judgments is as follows:
1.1.1 Fair values
2
Wherever possible, the Group continues to use observable market prices to value its investments. In response to market dislocation during the  . Bu
s
period, the Group increased the frequency of the Merchant Banking valuation cycles and provided updated valuations to its investors, as at the end  in
e
of March, June and December 2020. The effects of these valuation updates are fully reflected in the accounts for the period. During the period,  ss
the method of valuation and the controls surrounding the valuations have not changed, although specific attention has been given to the earnings,   rev
reported and projected, of the portfolio companies in such an uncertain market scenario. iew
Merchant Banking considers the industry sectors most affected by the COVID-19 crisis to be leisure, travel, aviation, non-food retail of the “bricks 
and mortar” kind, automotive and energy. Its exposure to these sectors is very limited, being approximately 6.2% of its total portfolio. The MB 
portfolio has proven to be resilient so far to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of the businesses in which it has invested 
increasing their valuations during the year thanks to the mission-critical nature of their services, their entrenched market positions and the recurring 
nature of their revenue streams. MB continues to manage its assets very carefully to ensure that they are adequately prepared to face future 
outbreaks of the pandemic, but, at the same time, are able to take advantage of the available growth opportunities.
Comprehensive disclosures about the assumptions used and the sensitivities of the valuations are made in section 4.5 Fair value disclosures.
1.1.2 Credit risk on loans to customers and accounts receivable
3
In line with the recommendations of regulatory authorities and of the IASB in light of COVID-19, the Group has reviewed the methodology and  . M
a
assumptions it uses for the measurement of expected credit losses. The adaptations made are described in section 4.2.2.1 Grouping of  n
a
instruments for losses measured on a collective basis. ge

p
o
Accounts receivable from the GA business are already reviewed on a quarterly basis, and these reviews during the period have, in particular, focused  rt
on individual debtors that could have been adversely affected by the effects of the pandemic. The provisioning process is explained further in section 
4.2.3 Credit risk management of other financial assets.
1.1.3 Moratoriums
Some borrowers in the corporate loan book have taken advantage of opportunities to postpone scheduled loan payments, known as moratoriums, 
following the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. The terms of the moratoriums granted by the Group to its clients vary from country to country. In France, 
for example, since March 2020, six-month moratoriums have been permitted on all outstanding corporate loans, with no specific granting conditions. 
During 2020, moratoriums granted by the whole Group were mainly for the corporate portfolio. As at December 2020, the majority of these 
4
moratoriums have expired. €34 million of moratoriums had not expired and were outstanding at year end. Under the terms of the moratoriums,  . F
interest continues to accrue and, in the absence of contradictory evidence, such a postponement is not automatically considered as a significant  ina
n
increase of credit risk (SICR), or a transfer into Stage 3. Postponement of payments are not considered as substantial modifications of the  c
ia
contractual cash flows of the loans, an event which would require derecognition of these loans. l s

1.1.4 Goodwill and intangible assets m
e
n
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are subject to an impairment test whenever there is any indication that their value may  ts
have diminished, and at least once a year. While the disruption related to COVID-19 does not in itself constitute an indication of impairment, the 
potential impact on the Group’s results and projections has been reflected in tests performed as at 31 December 2020 through consideration of 
stressed scenarios; these indicated no evidence of impairment.
1.1.5 Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised only if the relevant entity is likely to recover these assets. The Group only recognises deferred tax assets for 
losses carried forward after considering a projection of taxable income or expense of the relevant tax entities. As at 31 December 2020, the Group 
recognised deferred tax assets for losses carried forward only where recovery was probable after taking account of COVID-19 related uncertainties.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1.2  Changes of scope and adoption of new accounting policies
There are no significant changes in the consolidation scope in the twelve months ended 31 December 2020. There are also no changes in 
accounting standards which have a material impact on the Group’s accounts.
2.  Preparation of the financial statements
2.1  Information regarding the Company
The consolidated financial statements of the Group (i.e. Rothschild & Co SCA and its consolidated subsidiaries) for the twelve months ended 
31 December 2020 are presented in accordance with IFRS in force at the reporting date, as adopted in the European Union by way of EC Regulation 
No. 1606/2002. The format used for the financial statements is a banking format. It is consistent with Recommendation No. 2017-02 of 2 June 
2017 of the French Accounting Standards Authority (Autorité des normes comptables). The statements cover the period from 1 January 2020 to 
31 December 2020.
The consolidated accounts have been approved by Rothschild & Co Gestion SAS, the Managing Partner of Rothschild & Co, and, for verification  
and control purposes, were considered by the Supervisory Board on 9 March 2021.
On 31 December 2020, the Group’s holding company was Rothschild & Co, a French partnership limited by shares (société en commandite par 
actions), headquartered at 23 bis, avenue de Messine, 75008 Paris, France (Paris Trade and Companies Registry Number 302 519 228). The 
Company is listed on Euronext in Paris (Compartment A).
On 31 December 2020, the parent company of Rothschild & Co SCA was Rothschild & Co Concordia SAS, whose registered office is at 23 bis, 
avenue de Messine, 75008 Paris, France.
The Group has a worldwide presence and operates three main businesses: Global Advisory, Wealth and Asset Management, and Merchant Banking.
2.2  General principles
The notes to the accounts have been prepared having taken into account the understanding, relevance, reliability, comparability and materiality of 
the information provided. The Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
2.3  Changes to accounting standards
The following amendments to IFRS have been adopted for the first time in the EU for accounting periods starting from 1 January 2020:
2.3.1 Interest rate benchmark reform
The replacement of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates), including LIBOR, with alternative risk-free rates is expected to happen after 2021. The Group, 
through the Group Asset and Liability Committee (Group ALCO), continues to monitor regulatory and market developments to evaluate the impact of 
this on its products, services and processes. Given the nature of the Group’s businesses and the relatively limited exposure to long-term IBOR rates, 
there are not expected to be any significant issues resulting from IBOR transition for the Group or its clients.
In September 2019, the IASB published the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS17), which clarifies the way 
to account for hedging relationships during the period of uncertainty linked to the IBOR reform. It does not have a material impact on our current 
hedging relationships.
In August 2020, the IASB published the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16), 
which mainly focuses on changes in contractual cash flows. The IASB allows entities to not derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial 
instruments to reflect the changes required by the reform, but rather to update the effective interest rate to reflect the change in the alternative 
reference rate. The Group decided not to adopt the Phase 2 amendments early and therefore will apply them from 1 January 2021.
2.3.2 Definition of material (amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)
These amendments are intended to facilitate the exercise of judgment during the preparation of financial statements, particularly when selecting  
the information to be presented in the notes. They introduced the notion of obscuring, and advise against disclosing excessive information that  
is not helpful to the primary users of the accounts. The definition of what is material is carefully considered when preparing the Group’s accounts.
2.4  Forthcoming changes to accounting standards and reporting requirements
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (applicable for periods starting on 1 January 2023, after adoption by the European Union for application in Europe)  
is not expected to have any effect on the Group.
In accordance with the option granted by the applicable regulation, the Company has elected to postpone by one year the publication of the financial 
annual report in accordance with the European single electronic format (ESEF) as defined by the European Delegated Regulation 2019/815 
amended by the Delegated Regulation 2020/1989.

2.5  Subsequent events
Agreement to acquire Banque Pâris Bertrand
On 16 December 2020, the Group announced that its Wealth Management business had entered into an agreement to acquire Banque Pâris 
Bertrand. The transaction is expected to complete in the summer of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.
Banque Pâris Bertrand is a renowned private bank with headquarters in Switzerland and offices in Geneva and Luxembourg. Banque Pâris Bertrand’s 
client base consists of wealthy families, family offices and institutional investors, primarily from Switzerland, as well as other markets in Europe.
Following this acquisition, client assets for the Rothschild & Co Wealth Management business in Switzerland will reach over CHF 20 billion (from 
around CHF 14 billion as at 30 September 2020).

3.1  Consolidation method
3.1.1 Financial year end of the consolidated companies
For this reporting period, the financial statements of the Group are drawn up to 31 December 2020 and consolidate the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings. At each closing date, the Group draws conclusions from past experience and all relevant factors relating 
to its business.
Rothschild & Co and the majority of its subsidiaries are consolidated on the basis of a financial reporting date of 31 December 2020. A few 
entities report on the basis of a different financial reporting date. However, if a material subsequent event occurs between the closing date of  
these subsidiaries and 31 December, this event is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 31 December. 3. M
a
n
3.1.2 Subsidiaries ag
e
m
Subsidiaries are all entities which are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from  e
n
its involvement with that entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over that entity. t re
p
o
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated  rt
from the date on which the Group acquires control and cease to be consolidated from the date that control ceases.
3.1.3 Associates and joint arrangements
Associates are companies over whose financial and operational decisions the Group exercises significant influence but not control (this is generally 
demonstrated when the percentage of voting rights is equal to or greater than 20% but less than or equal to 50%).
Joint arrangements are where two or more parties, through a contractual arrangement, have joint control over the assets and liabilities of an 
arrangement. Depending on what those rights and obligations are, the joint arrangement will either be a joint operation (where the parties subject to 
the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement) or a joint venture (where the parties subject to the 
4
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement). . F
in
a
The Group’s investments in associated undertakings are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, they are increased or decreased by the Group’s  n
c
share of the post-acquisition profit or loss, or by other movements reflected directly in the equity of the associated undertaking, such as dividends  ial s
paid or translation movements. Positive goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associated undertaking is included in the cost of the investment  ta
(net of any accumulated impairment loss). tem
e
n
ts
3.1.4 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method specified by IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Thus, upon initial consolidation 
of a newly acquired company, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are measured 
at fair value in accordance with the provisions of IFRS. The costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised in the income 
statement for the period.
Contingent cash consideration can be included in the acquisition cost at its fair value on the acquisition date, even if its payment is not certain.  
In this case, it is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet, and any subsequent adjustments to its value are booked in the income statement  
in accordance with IFRS 9. However, sometimes arrangements are made in which contingent payments for acquiring a company are made to a 
vendor who is an employee, and these can be forfeited if the employee leaves voluntarily. In this case, these contingent payments are not considered 
as part of the acquisition cost. Instead, these payments are accounted for as a post-purchase staff expense.
Rothschild & Co | Annual Report 2020   179
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Goodwill in an associate or subsidiary represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of an acquisition’s cost over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of net identifiable assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, 
regardless of whether those rights are separate. If the fair value exceeds the cost, the difference (“negative goodwill”) is immediately recognised in 
the income statement. All necessary valuations of assets and liabilities must be carried out within twelve months of the date of acquisition, as must 
any corrections to the value based on new information.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment, or more 
frequently when circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be too high. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes 
of impairment testing. If the value of each of the cash-generating units is insufficient to support its carrying value, then the goodwill is impaired. 
Impairment losses on goodwill are recognised in the income statement and are not reversed.
Results from subsidiaries acquired during the financial year are included from their acquisition dates and income from subsidiaries sold is included 
up to their disposal dates.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
3.1.5 Non-controlling interests
For all business combinations, the Group assesses non-controlling interests as either:
•  based on its share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of the acquisition, without recognising the goodwill for 
non-controlling interests (partial goodwill method); or
•  at fair value at the date of acquisition. Consequently, the recognition of the goodwill is allocated to Group share and to non-controlling interests 
(full goodwill method).
On the date an entity is acquired, any stake in this entity already held by the Group is revalued at fair value through profit or loss, because taking 
control is accounted for as a sale and repurchase of the shares previously held.
In the event of an increase in the Group’s stake in entities over which it already exercises control, the difference between the price paid for the 
additional stake and the fair value of the share of net assets acquired on this date is booked in the Group’s reserves as a reallocation from non-
controlling interests to other equity. In the same way, any reduction in the Group’s stake in an entity which it continues to control is accounted for as 
an equity transaction between shareholders. On the date when the Group loses control of a consolidated subsidiary, any investment retained in the 
former subsidiary is revalued at fair value through the income statement.
3.1.6 Contracts to purchase non-controlled shares in subsidiaries
Where non-controlling shareholders have a contract to sell their equity interests in a subsidiary to the Group, the Group applies the anticipated-
acquisition method of accounting for the interests that it did not already own. This means that the contract is accounted for as if the non-controlling 
shareholders had sold their shares to the Group, even though legally they are still NCoI. This happens regardless of how the exercise price is 
determined (e.g. fixed or variable) and how likely it is that the contract will be exercised. Where the deferred consideration is linked to a put option, 
not a forward purchase, the Group recognises changes in the carrying amount of the liability in equity, including the accretion of interest.
3.2  Accounting principles and valuation methods
3.2.1 Accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise judgment in applying the accounting policies. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions are significant to the accounts, include:
Valuation of financial assets and liabilities
Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants. The fair value used to measure a financial instrument is, where available, the listed price when the financial instrument is listed  
on an active market. In the absence of an active market, fair value is determined using measurement techniques.
A description of the valuation techniques used; analysis of assets and liabilities carried at fair value by valuation hierarchy; and a sensitivity analysis 
of valuations not primarily based on observable market data is provided in section 4.5 of the financial statements.
Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost
The Group uses judgments when recognising the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) for financial assets at amortised cost. This applies in particular to 
the assessment of significant increases in credit risk (SICR), and to the models and assumptions used to measure ECL. Management determines 
the size of the impairment allowance required using a range of factors such as the realisable value of any collateral; the likely recovery on liquidation 
or bankruptcy; the viability of the customer’s business model; and their capacity to trade successfully out of financial difficulties and generate 
sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.

The accuracy of the allowances made depends on how accurately the Group estimates future cash flows for credit-impaired financial assets (stage 3), 
in particular the fair value of any collateral, and the model assumptions and parameters used in determining allowances for financial assets classified 
in Stages 1 and 2. While this necessarily involves judgment, the Group believes that its allowances are reasonable and supportable.
A description of the methodology used for assessing collective impairments of the main instruments classified at amortised cost is provided in 
section 4.2.2.1 of the financial statements.
Pensions
Defined benefit obligations are calculated at least annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and the principal 
assumptions used are set out in Note 20. The assumptions that have the greatest impact on the measurement of the pension fund liability, along 
with their sensitivities, are also set out in Note 20.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed at least annually to determine whether they are impaired. The assessment includes 
management assumptions on future income flows and judgments on appropriate discount rates. Management performs sensitivity analysis of these 
assumptions as part of this assessment. Further details of management’s assessment are contained in Note 10 and Note 11.
Provisions
From time to time the Group is involved in legal proceedings or receives claims arising from the conduct of its business. Based upon available 
information and, where appropriate, legal advice, provisions are made where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required and the 
amount can be reliably estimated.

rt
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s reporting currency. Items 
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiaries and associates are measured using their functional currency. The functional 
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Income statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s reporting currency at closing exchange rates for each month, 
where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Their balance sheets are translated at the 
exchange rate at the end of the period. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to 
shareholders’ equity. On disposal or substantive disposal of a foreign entity, these translation differences are recognised in the income statement  
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Translation differences on equities classified as FVTPL are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss in the income statement. 4. F

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
3.2.3 Financial assets and liabilities – classification and measurement
Initial recognition
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.
Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions. Under IFRS, regular way purchases and sales 
can be recognised on the trade or the settlement date. A regular way purchase is a purchase of a financial asset under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the asset within an established time frame (for example, T+2). The Group applies trade date accounting for the purchase and 
sale of securities. Trade date accounting means that the purchase or sale is recognised on the day when the Group commits to purchase or sell 
the securities. For FX spot contracts, the Group applies settlement date accounting. Settlement date accounting means that the contract is only 
recognised at the point of delivery.
Financial assets at amortised cost
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
•  the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
•  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised and measured as described in section 3.2.4 
Financial assets – impairment. Interest income from these financial assets is included in “Interest income” using the effective interest method.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
•  the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
•  the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on a specified date to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign 
exchange gains and losses on the instrument’s amortised cost, which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in net banking income. Interest 
income from these financial assets is included in “interest income” using the effective interest method.
On initial recognition of an equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in OCI. 
This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities 
designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets that meet the criteria for the classification of amortised cost or FVOCI, but which are managed, and whose performance is 
evaluated, on a fair value basis, are measured at FVTPL on a designated basis.
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for the classification of amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL on a mandatory basis.
These financial assets are recognised at fair value, with transaction costs recorded immediately in the income statement, and they are subsequently 
measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value, or on derecognition, as well as interests and dividends from financial 
assets at FVTPL are recognised in the income statement as net gains or losses on financial assets at FVTPL.
Business model assessment
When considering classification, the Group’s assessment of the business model in which an asset is held is made at the portfolio level, because 
this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
•  the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, the Group considers whether 
management’s strategy focuses on earning interest revenue; maintaining a particular interest profile; matching the duration of the financial 
assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets; or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
•  how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management;
•  the risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed;
•  how managers of the business are compensated, e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual 
cash flows collected; and
•  the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods; the reason for such sales; and its expectations about future sales activity. However, 
information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for 
managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)
For the purposes of this assessment, “principal” is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. “Interest” is defined as 
consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time 
and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit margin.
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing 
whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet 
this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:
•  contingent events that would change the amounts and timing of cash flows;
•  prepayment and extension terms;
2
•  leverage features; . B
•  terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and us
•  features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates). ine
s
s
A prepayment compensation is considered as reasonable, and therefore SPPI compliant, when the amount is calculated as a percentage of the   re
v
outstanding amount of the loan and is capped by regulations. For example, in France, compensation for the prepayment of mortgage loans by  iew
individuals is legally capped at an amount equal to six months of interest or 3% of the principal outstanding, and this is treated as SPPI.
Reclassifications
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except when the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except for derivatives that are classified as fair value 
through profit or loss on initial recognition (unless designated as cash flow hedges).

Credit risk and provisioning stages
IFRS 9 outlines a three-stage model for impairments based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition, as summarised below:
•  A financial instrument that is not credit impaired on initial recognition is classified in Stage 1.
4
•  If a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to Stage 2 but is not yet  . F
deemed to be credit impaired. See below for a description of how the Group determines when an SICR has occurred. in
a
n
•  If the financial instrument is credit impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to Stage 3. c
ia
•  Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of the lifetime ECL that result from default events  l s
possible within the next 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on ECL on a lifetime basis. See below for   tate
a description of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring the ECL. m
e
•  Purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets are those financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. Their ECL  nts
is always measured on a lifetime basis (Stage 3).
For the accounts receivable, the Group uses a simplified approach, under which impairments are calculated as the lifetime ECL from initial 
recognition, regardless of any changes in the counterparty’s credit risk.
The key judgments and assumptions adopted by the Group in addressing the requirements of the standard are disclosed below.
Rothschild & Co | Annual Report 2020   183
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)
When determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group considers 
reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative 
information and analysis, which are based on the Group’s credit risk management process. The Group has decided that an SICR is indicated if the 
relevant credit committee decides that the credit rating of a financial asset is Category 2 or 3.
Financial instruments are often considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk if the borrower is more than 30 days past due on 
its contractual payments. For fee income receivable by the GA business, the Group has rebutted this presumption and it considers that a significant 
increase is experienced only after 90 days past due. This rebuttal is based on historical experience of payments and is in line with the internal 
provisioning process (more detail is in section 4.2.2.1).
The Group has not used the low credit risk exemption for any financial instruments in the period. 
Definition of credit impairment and default
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt instruments at FVOCI are credit impaired 
(Stage 3). When an asset is considered as credit impaired, it is also considered to be in default. A financial asset is credit impaired when one or 
more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is credit impaired includes the following observable data:
•  significant financial difficulty of the issuer;
•  a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in repayment of interest or principal;
•  granting to the borrower, for economic or legal reasons relating to its financial difficulty, a concession that the lender would not 
otherwise consider;
•  it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower’s condition is usually considered to be credit impaired unless there is 
evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition,  
a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired.
A financial asset that is classified as credit impaired (Stage 3) has a credit rating of Category 4 or 5 (more detail on credit rating is given in 4.2.1).
Measurement of expected credit loss
ECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. It is measured as follows:
•  financial assets that are not credit impaired (Stage 1 & 2) at the reporting date: measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the 
difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);
•  financial assets that are credit impaired (Stage 3) at the reporting date: measured as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows;
•  undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if the 
commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and
•  financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.
ECL is the discounted product of the following factors:
ECL = Probability of Default (PD) x Exposure at Default (EAD) x Loss Given Default (LGD)
The PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (based on the definition of default in our accounting principles), 
either over the next twelve months (12m PD), or over the remaining lifetime (lifetime PD) of the obligation.
The EAD is based on the amount the Group expects to be owed at the time of default, over the next twelve months (12m EAD) or over the remaining 
lifetime (lifetime EAD). The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty.
LGD is the percentage of the exposure likely to be lost if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters informed by historical recovery 
rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral and recovery cost of any collateral that is 
provided to secure the financial asset. For loans secured by property, LTV ratios are a key parameter in determining LGD.
These parameters are generally derived from internally developed models and other historical data. 
Presentation of allowance for ECL in the balance sheet
Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the balance sheet as follows:
•  financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;
•  loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: as a provision; and
•  debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the balance sheet because the carrying amount of these assets is their 
fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in the fair value reserve.

Write-off
The Group writes off financial assets (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the 
Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject 
to the write-off.
3.2.5 Derivative instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives
Derivatives are entered into for trading or risk management purposes. Derivatives used for risk management are recognised as hedging instruments 
when they qualify as such under IAS 39. According to the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group made the choice to maintain the IAS 39  2
provisions related to hedge accounting. . B
u
s
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income  ine
s
statement. If there is a designated hedging relationship between a hedging instrument and a hedged item, the recognition of the profit or loss on   s re
the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument must comply with the conditions of IAS 39, depending on the hedging relationship. vie
w
Hedge accounting
The Group may apply hedge accounting when transactions meet the criteria set out in IAS 39. At the inception of the hedge, the Group assesses 
whether the hedging derivatives meet the effectiveness criteria of IAS 39 in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. 
The Group then documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. It also records its risk management objectives,  
its strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship.
After inception, effectiveness is tested on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is determined that a derivative has ceased to 
be highly effective, or when the derivative or the hedged item is derecognised, or when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.

Net investment hedge in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
3.2.6 Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset when:
•  the contractual rights to cash flows arising from the financial assets have expired; or 4
•  it transfers the financial asset, including substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset; or . Fin
•  it transfers the financial asset, neither retaining nor transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but no longer retains control  an
c
of the asset. ia
l s
If a sale is followed by an immediate buyback and the Group considers that it has substantially retained the risks and rewards of ownership, it would  tate
not derecognise the asset. m
e
n
ts
3.2.7 Securitisation transactions
The Group may enter into funding arrangements with lenders in order to finance specific financial assets.
In general, the assets from these transactions are held on the Group’s balance sheet on origination. However, to the extent that substantially all the 
risks and returns associated with the assets have been transferred to a third party, the assets and liabilities are derecognised in whole or in part.
Interests in securitised financial assets may be taken in the form of senior or subordinated tranches of debt securities, or other residual interests. 
The Group makes an assessment of whether the tranches held meet the SPPI criteria. A critical point to consider is whether the given tranche has 
a credit rating that is higher than the underlying portfolio of assets. Those which do (generally the senior tranches) can be classified as amortised 
cost. Those which do not (generally the junior tranches) must be classified as FVTPL.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
3.2.8 Intangible assets
Intangible assets include software, intellectual property rights and assets acquired through business combinations such as brands, contracts  
to earn management fees, and client relationships. These are carried at historical cost less amortisation, if any, and less any accumulated 
impairment losses.
For assets with a definite life, amortisation is charged over the useful economic life of the asset, which is determined case by case based on 
the asset or contract. Contracts to earn management fees are amortised in line with income earned from the contracts; otherwise a straight-line 
amortisation method is used. The intangible assets which have a definite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is objective evidence of impairment. If such evidence exists, an impairment test is performed.
The Group’s acquired brands have been considered to have an indefinite life and are not amortised; instead they are subject to an annual 
impairment test.
3.2.9 Tangible assets
Tangible assets comprise plant, property and equipment and are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the given asset. The deemed cost refers to the situation in which, 
on transition to IFRS, the Group elected to consider the fair value of a tangible asset at that time to be its deemed cost.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost of assets to their residual 
values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Computer equipment   2 – 10 years 
Cars      3 – 5 years 
Fixtures and fittings   3 – 10 years 
Leasehold improvements  4 – 24 years 
Buildings     10 – 60 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement, in “net income/(expense) from other assets”.
3.2.10 Impairment of tangible assets
At each balance sheet date, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances dictate, tangible assets are assessed for indications of 
impairment. If such indications are present, these assets are subject to an impairment review. If impaired, the carrying values of assets are written 
down by the amount of any impairment and the loss is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurs. A previously recognised 
impairment loss relating to a fixed asset may be reversed when a change in circumstances leads to a change in the estimates used to determine 
the fixed asset’s recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the fixed asset could then increase up to the amount that it would have been had the 
original impairment not been recognised.
3.2.11 Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised only when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events. In addition, it must be 
probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and it must also be possible to make a reliable estimate of the 
amount of the obligation.
Contingent liabilities can be possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed by one or more uncertain future events 
not wholly within the Group’s control. Alternatively, they could be present obligations that are not recognised either because it is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably estimated. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed unless the possibility of a transfer of economic benefits is remote.
3.2.12 Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes, both funded and unfunded, and of the defined benefit and 
defined contribution types.
For defined contribution schemes, the contribution payable in respect of the accounting period is recognised in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses for defined benefit schemes are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the statement  
of comprehensive income.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes is the difference between the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date and the fair value of the plan’s assets. Independent actuaries calculate the defined benefit obligation 
at least annually, using the projected unit credit method. The obligations’ present values are determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currencies in which the benefits will be paid and that have 
terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

3.2.13 Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group earns fee and commission income from a range of services it provides to clients. Fee income generated by the Group can be categorised 
into the two broad categories below, depending upon the timing of the relevant service.
Point in time services
These fees are earned from providing services for which revenue is earned only when the service has been completed, i.e. once a performance 
obligation has been satisfied. Examples include a payment for advisory services that will only be made after the successful completion of a mandate, 
or an asset management performance fee which relies on meeting a specified return over a specified period. Revenue is recognised when it is highly 
probable that there will not be a significant reversal of the revenue in future. To minimise subjectivity and enhance comparability from year to year, 
the revenue is only recognised by the Group when a performance obligation has been contractually met. 2

extended period of time. For GA, these services include advisory services paid upfront or on a retainer basis. Revenue is recognised over the period  w
in which the services are provided, once one of the following occurs:
i) t he customer consumes the benefits provided by the Group and another entity would not need to substantially re-perform the work that the Group 
has completed to date; or
ii) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
The amount of fee and commission income is based on consideration specified in a legally enforceable contract. The revenue recognised for each 
mandated service represents a market price, and consideration received is allocated to the separately identifiable performance obligations in the 
contract.
Fees and commissions that are an integral part of a loan, and loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down, are deferred 
3
(together with related direct costs) and recognised over the life of the loan as an adjustment to the effective interest rate. . M
a
Costs can sometimes be charged to the client in the course of a mandate. Where recoverable, these are recognised as a receivable when incurred  na
g
and do not impact profit or loss when recovered. em
e
n
3.2.14 Interest income and expense t re
p
o
Interest receivable and payable includes interest arising from the lending and deposit-taking business, interest on related hedging transactions and  rt
interest on debt securities, as well as discounting of lease and other liabilities. Interest on all financial instruments, excluding those classified as 
held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss, is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Where negative interest arises from financial assets, the negative interest income is disclosed within interest expense. Where negative interest 
arises from financial liabilities, the negative interest expense is disclosed within interest income.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows of a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.  
It is used to calculate the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and to allocate the interest over the relevant period (usually the 
expected life of the instrument). When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group considers all contractual terms of the financial instrument 
(for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes any premiums or discounts, as well as all  
4
fees and transaction costs that are an integral part of the loan. . F
in
a
n
3.2.15 Carried interest cia
l s
The Group is entitled to receive carried interest in relation to certain of the private equity and private debt funds that it manages. Carried interest  ta
te
receivable is accrued if the performance conditions associated with earning it would be achieved, on the assumption that the remaining assets   m
e
in the fund were realised at the balance sheet date at fair value. Fair value is determined using the valuation methodology applied by the Group   nts
in its role as manager to its funds and is measured at the balance sheet date. An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of profits in excess  
of the performance conditions, taking into account any cash already paid to the fund’s investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
Certain employees may also hold classes of share capital which give them a right to receive carried interest from investments managed by the 
Group. Where such carry shares held by staff are in an investment vehicle which is not consolidated, the interests of the staff are reflected in  
a reduced investment return of the Group’s own interests. Where the carry shares held by staff are in a vehicle which is consolidated, the interests 
of the staff are treated as non- controlling interests of the Group. The valuation of the interests held by staff is calculated at the balance sheet date 
using the same method as the valuation of the Group’s interests, as described above.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
3.2.16 Long-term incentive schemes
Long-term profit share schemes
The Group operates long-term profit share schemes for the benefit of employees. The costs of such schemes are recognised in the income 
statement over the period in which the services are rendered that give rise to the obligation. Where the payment of profit share is deferred until the 
end of a specified vesting period, and the payment is contingent of the employee working until the vesting period ends, then the deferred amount  
is recognised in the income statement over the period up to the date of vesting.
Share-based payments
The Group has issued share options which are treated as equity-settled share-based payments. These are valued at the date they are granted to 
employees and that value is recognised in staff costs over the vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders’ equity. The fair value 
is calculated on the basis of the overall plan value at the date of grant. In the absence of any market for the Group’s stock options, models are used 
to value the share-based payments. The only assumptions revised after the initial measurement, and hence resulting in a revaluation of the expense, 
are those relating to the probability that employees will leave the Group.
The Group also pays certain employees using non-cash instruments in the form of R&Co shares (which are also treated as equity-settled share-
based payments), or cash awards linked to the value of R&Co shares (which are treated as cash-settled share-based payments). Equity-settled 
payments are valued at the date they are granted to employees and that value is recognised in staff costs over the vesting period. The cash-settled 
payments are also valued at the date they are granted, but the liability is then revalued in the income statement up to the point of settlement.
3.2.17 Taxation
Tax payable on profits and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that they relate to gains and losses that are 
recognised in equity, in which case the relevant tax is also recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that are expected to apply when a deferred tax asset  
is realised, or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets, including the tax effects of income tax losses available for carry forward, are only recognised where it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are provided on temporary differences 
arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and 
it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
3.2.18 Dividends
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting or, in the case of interim dividends, when they are paid by the Company after decisions of the Managing Partner, Rothschild & Co Gestion.
3.2.19 Classification of debt and shareholders’ equity
Under IFRS, the critical feature in differentiating a debt instrument from an equity instrument is the existence of a contractual obligation of the 
Group to deliver cash (or another financial asset) to another entity. Where there is no such contractual obligation, the Group will classify the financial 
instrument as equity; otherwise it will be classified as a liability and carried at amortised cost. The terms of the perpetual debt instruments issued 
by the Group permit interest payments to be waived unless discretionary dividends have been paid in the previous six months. These instruments 
are, therefore, considered to be equity. Equity securities issued by the Company are recorded within Capital and associated reserves. If they are 
issued by Group subsidiaries and held by parties outside the Group, these securities are recognised as non-controlling interests.
3.2.20 Fiduciary activities
The Group acts as custodian and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of customers. These assets 
are excluded from the Group’s financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.

3.2.21 Leases
Accounting for leases as a lessee
At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A lease conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract contains a lease, the Group assesses whether:
•  the contract involves the use of an identified asset without a substantive substitution right given to the lessor.
•  the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
•  the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
The Group recognises a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU asset is initially measured  
at the initial amount of the lease liability recognised, plus an estimate of costs to dismantle and restore the underlying asset, less any lease  2. B
incentives received. u
s
in
e
The ROU asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of ROU assets usually match the expected  s
s
term of the lease. The ROU asset may be adjusted if the lease liability is remeasured, and can be reduced by impairment losses, if applicable.  re
v
ie
w
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental 
borrowing rate in the region where the lease is held. Extension and termination options exist for a number of leases, particularly for rentals of 
offices. In determining the length of the lease term, extension and termination options are included in the assessment only where the Group is 
reasonably certain that these options will be exercised; this assessment looks beyond contractual terms and considers the broader economic 
context of the arrangements. In practice, it is rare that the Group will consider an option to be reasonably certain to exercise if it is due to be 
exercised over ten years in the future.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
•  fixed payments;
•  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; and
•  any costs that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise relating to renewal or termination options on the lease.
3
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease  . Ma
n
payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or  a
g
termination option. em
e
n
When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset. t re
p
o
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets rt
The Group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less, or 
leases of low-value assets, including most IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Accounting for leases as a lessor
Lessors in the Group continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all of the risks 
and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
In some jurisdictions, the Group is a lessor of finance leases. When the Group holds assets subject to a finance lease, the present value of the  4
lease payments is recognised as a receivable and the originally held asset is derecognised. The difference between the gross receivable and the  . Fin
a
present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease  n
c
using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of return. ial s

4.  Financial risk management
4.1  Governance
The risks relating to financial instruments, and the way in which these are managed by the Group, are described below. A description of the Group’s 
governance environment is provided in the Report on Corporate Governance section of the Management Report in the annual report.
4.2  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual 
obligations to the Group.
4.2.1 Credit rating
The Group reviews credit exposures on financial assets on a quarterly basis and for this purpose they are classified as follows:
Category Definition Mapping to IFRS 9 three-stage 
model for impairment
Category 1 Exposures which are considered to be fully performing. Stage 1
Category 2 Exposures where the payment of interest or principal is not currently in doubt, but which require closer  Stage 2
observation than usual, due perhaps to some deterioration in the position of the client. Examples 
include: poor trading results; difficult conditions in the client’s market sector; competitive or regulatory 
threats; or the potential impact from currency or other factors.
Unimpaired GA receivables which are past due over 90 days are included in this category.
Category 3 Exposures where there has been further deterioration in the position of the client compared to Category  Stage 2
2. Although the exposure is not considered to be impaired, the relationship requires close monitoring by 
the front office team.
Category 4 Exposures that are considered to be impaired and which carry a provision against part of the loan.   Stage 3
At least some recovery is expected to be made.
Category 5 Exposures that are considered to be impaired and which carry a full provision. No significant recovery of  Stage 3
value is expected.
All Group companies map their own credit monitoring to these categories for the purposes of Group reporting.
The tables below disclose the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2020 and at 31 December 2019 for financial assets with exposure 
to credit risk, without taking account of collateral held or other credit risk mitigation. Following a review during the period of exposures that are 
classified as Category 1 to 3, certain changes have been made to enhance consistency between judgments made by different credit committees, 
and some comparative categories throughout section 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 have been adjusted as at December 2019 to enhance comparability.
Allowances against commitments and guarantees are included in “Provisions for counterparty risk” (Note 15).

4.2.2 Credit risk exposure
4.2.2.1 Grouping of instruments for losses measured on a collective basis
For expected credit loss provisions calculated on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of risk characteristics that are 
shared by exposures.
Lending by the R&Co Group is primarily focused on supporting the WAM business by way of lending to private clients, against portfolios of securities 
(Lombard lending) or by way of mortgages against residential properties. In addition, there is a French portfolio of corporate exposures which includes  4
some sector specialisations (this equates to €227 million of the total in the balance sheet as at December 2020 (December 2019: €345 million).   . Fin
The UK commercial legacy book continues to run off and is now down to less than €25 million net of provisions (less than €30 million as at  an
c
December 2019). ia
l s
The majority of the Private Client Lending (PCL) books are secured and there is no historical record of losses for these. Nevertheless, we have  tate
adopted a conservative approach to measuring losses on a collective basis for these loans, based on assumptions of PD and LGD for different loan  m
e
types. The approach for the remaining book, which generally comprises a larger number of smaller loans, does have some loss data, and this has  nts
been factored into the IFRS 9 calculations.
PCL LOMBARD AND MORTGAGE LOANS
The Group has a history of very low defaults on its Lombard and mortgage loans made by PCL, and the PD and the LGD have been determined by 
the history of observed defaults alongside realistic downside scenarios based on management assessment.
For the Lombard loans, the LGD is estimated based on the amount of collateral held, and whether it is diversified or not, as well as the nature of the 
client and the potential difficulties of recovering the value of the collateral. In the base case for assessment of credit risk, the weighted average PD 
is 0.3% and the weighted average LGD is 6%.
For the mortgage loans, the LGD is estimated considering the value of the properties which are mortgaged, and varies based on the LTV; the amount 
of costs likely to be incurred in recovering and realising any collateral; the nature of the client; and the potential difficulties of recovering the value of 
the collateral. In the base case, the weighted average PD is 1.7% and weighted average LGD is 5%.
In response to market disruption caused by COVID-19, the forward-looking estimates used to calculate ECL in the PCL book have been reviewed. The 
base case assumptions have been revisited, and additional provisions have been made as at December 2020 to reflect increased uncertainty under 
a stressed scenario. However, the Group still considers that there is a very low risk of a material loss from these loans.
Rothschild & Co | Annual Report 2020   191
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
OTHER LOANS TO CUSTOMERS
The Group also makes other loans to customers, mainly in the French corporate market and to fund real estate development. Other lending is also 
provided from time to time to support Asset Management and Merchant Banking activities of the Group. In response to COVID-19, the ECL in these 
businesses has been considered on a sector-by-sector basis, and, wherever significant, on a loan-by-loan basis. The basis of assessment of the PD 
and LGD for each sector has been informed by historical losses, combined with a forward-looking judgment of the ways the current situation may 
increase the level of future losses.
Because of the relatively small size of this portfolio, especially any part which is not assessed for credit risk on an individual basis, the Group does 
not use a model to estimate correlations between the macroeconomic variables and the probability of default. For loans where there is no obvious 
sign of distress, or for loans which are too small for individual review, additional top-down management overlays have been made in cost of risk to 
reflect increases in the credit risk which are not possible to detect at an individual level.
DEBT AT AMORTISED COST
For debt securities in the treasury portfolio, S&P credit ratings are used to determine the ECL. These published ratings are monitored and updated 
daily. The 12m and lifetime PDs associated with each rating are determined based on realised default rates, also published by S&P. To estimate the 
LGD, the Group has used the Basel III LGD, which is 45% for senior debt.
The assumptions underlying the ECL calculation are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
There have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period.
4.2.2.2 Maximum exposure to credit risk – financial instruments subject to impairment
The following table contains an analysis of the credit risk exposure of financial instruments for which an ECL allowance might be recognised. The 
gross carrying amount of financial assets below also represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on these assets. As explained in 
section 4.2.1, some comparative Stages have been adjusted as at December 2019 to enhance comparability. The credit risk exposure of other 
financial assets is shown in section 4.2.3.

4.2.2.3 Collateral
The Group holds collateral against loans to customers, as substantially all third-party commercial lending is secured. The majority of collateral is in  4
the form of charges over property assets, or over marketable securities (Lombard lending). There is a realistic possibility, if necessary, of both taking  . Fin
possession of, and realising, the collateral. an
c
ia
Stage 1 and 2 loans are usually covered by collateral, and the level of collateral at exit is expected to be sufficient to cover the balance sheet  l s
exposure. Where a loan is deemed to be impaired (Stage 3), the level of the impairment charge is primarily driven by any expected shortfall in the  tate
collateral value, though it is also influenced by the ability of the borrower to service the debt. m
e
n
Collateral is valued independently at the time the loan is made and periodically thereafter. Management is able to roll forward a valuation between  ts
these events via a combination of specific knowledge of the collateral and the application of general indices.

4.2.3 Credit risk management of other financial assets
Other financial assets mainly contain trade receivables from the GA and WAM businesses. For these assets, the Group applies a simplified approach 
to the calculation of impairments. This means that the loss allowance is always measured at an amount equal to the asset’s lifetime ECL. Therefore, 
the concept of a significant increase in credit risk is not applicable to these assets. Fee income is widespread in terms of location and of sector, so 
concentration risk is not significant.
The Group considers a receivable to be in default when the borrower is unlikely to pay the Group in full. For each GA office, a quarterly review is 
conducted by local management and the GA Global Finance Director of any outstanding receivables where there is any concern over recovery, as well 
as any receivable over 90 days. This review determines if the receivable should be impaired and ensures that impairments are made, or not made, 
consistently around the Group.
Management has reviewed historical payment behaviour and believes on this basis that receivables less than 90 days overdue have, prima facie, 
an immaterial risk of not being recoverable in full. These receivables are therefore classified as Category 1 in our internal credit risk table, unless 
there are specific reasons to consider them doubtful. Management considers that all individual unimpaired receivables over 90 days past due merit 
assessment for potential credit losses, in addition to more recent debts which are known to have credit issues. These receivables are considered  
to be on a watchlist. Where these are not impaired, management provides a percentage of all these assets to reflect losses that might be expected 
to eventually arise. The provision percentage takes account of both historical experience and management’s assessment of future potential losses.
The table below shows the ageing of other financial assets and the associated provisions as at 31 December 2020 and at 31 December 2019.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Short-term accounts receivable and liquid debt securities, issued by non-financial corporations and held for treasury management, are exposed to 
various diversified sectors. Any exposure to these sectors is not thought by management to pose a significant sectoral risk, and in the case of short-
term assets is not expected to be indicative of sectoral concentration for these assets in future. Therefore, these exposures are not analysed further 
in this section.
4.3  Market Risk
Market risks associated with treasury and equity positions are described below with a description of the levels of risk. Market risk management is 
covered in the Internal control, risk management and accounting procedures section of the Management Report in the annual report.
4.3.1 Equity investments
The Group has exposure to equity price risk through holdings of equity investments by its Merchant Banking business and through holding other 
equities, including those issued by mutual funds. The Group is also exposed to the risks affecting the companies in which it invests. Each MB 
investment is individually approved by management and is monitored on an individual basis.
If the price of these equities were to fall by 5% at 31 December 2020, then there would be a post-tax charge to the income statement of €54.7 
million (31 December 2019: €55.1 million).
The table below shows the Group’s equity price risk in relation to these instruments, by location.

4.3.2 Currency risk
The Group has exposure to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. The table  
below summarises exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The net positions in the table are measured by reference to the net carrying 
amounts of monetary assets and liabilities other than those in a subsidiary’s functional currency, and are shown after taking account of positions  
in derivatives.

USD 42.1 36.3
EUR 11.2 13.9
GBP (1.8)  (4.6) 
CHF 2.7 0.1
Other (5.9)  1.4
If the euro strengthened against these currencies by 5%, then the effect on the Group would be a loss to the income statement of €0.4 million 
(31 December 2019: gain of €0.2 million).
4.3.3 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates. Management of interest rate risk is covered in the 
Internal control, risk management and accounting procedures section of the Management Report in the annual report.
Because of the nature of its business, only the banking entities in the Group are exposed to significant interest rate risk. The Group calculates 
Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) in line with the EBA requirements. The following table sets out the results of the EVE (Economic 
Value of Equity) stress tests for each prescribed stress scenario, as a percentage of tier 1 capital. This illustrates the low level of interest rate risk 
that the Group’s banking entities and, on a consolidated basis, the R&Co Group is exposed to, even under these severe stress tests.
The top section shows the results based on the assumption that sight deposits re-price overnight. It demonstrates the limited exposure to interest 
rate risk, which results from the Group’s focus on private banking, as well as the very limited fixed-rate long-term lending exposures taken on in  
this activity.

ie

There is, however, some interest rate risk for certain sight deposits which behave as 0% fixed non-maturity deposits. As a result of this, the Group 
behaviourally adjusts sight deposits in RMM, given the requirements of the French regulator along with the expectation that some of these deposits 
will behave in the same way as a fixed-rate liability. On the other hand, and in the light of RMM’s deposits being of a largely private banking nature, 
these deposits are not considered to be very long term. Therefore, the Group behaviourally adjusts the stable amount linearly over five years with 
the non-stable amount re-fixing over three months. The results of this approach for RMM, and its impact on the Group, are set out in the lower half of 
the table. No behavioural adjustments are applied for IRRBB in the Group’s other banks, because these are not required by the local regulators and, 
given the market flexibility to charge negative rates combined with the higher average deposit size, this is not appropriate at the current time.
IRRBB EVE results of the prescribed six shock scenarios as at 31 December 2020 are as follows. The table is not audited.

The Group continues to take a conservative approach to the management of liquidity risk and R&Co retains a very strong liquidity position at  t re
p
31 December 2020 of €8.7 billion, which is 59% of gross assets and 90% of deposits. ort
Liquidity assets held by the Group consist mainly of amounts at central banks and banks (€6.9 billion) and investment grade debt securities 
(€1.8 billion). These debt securities are closely monitored and the holdings and limits for the weaker credits have been reduced where considered 
necessary. Overall there is limited exposure to securities in the BBB range of €119 million. Regarding sectors, the majority of the exposure is to 
financials and supranationals. Corporate exposure is €182 million and is reasonably well diversified across sectors and counterparties.
Movements in customer deposits are all as expected in the normal course of business and the core client deposit book has remained stable over 
the period to December 2020.
Each of the Group’s banks maintains low loan-to-deposit ratios and a significant amount of high-quality liquidity, for example central bank deposits, to 
ensure they maintain a minimum level of 20% of all client deposits in cash or assets readily realisable into cash within 48 hours. Set out below are  4
the regulatory liquidity coverage ratios (LCR) of the Group’s banks, all of which are well in excess of the regulatory minimum of 100%. The reduction  . F

4.5  Fair value disclosures
4.5.1 Fair value hierarchy
For financial reporting purposes, IFRS 13 requires fair value measurements which are applied to financial instruments to be allocated to one of three 
Levels, reflecting the extent to which the valuation is based on observable data.
Level 1: instruments quoted on an active market
Level 1 comprises instruments whose fair value is determined based on directly usable prices quoted on active markets. This mainly consists of 
listed securities and derivatives traded on organised markets (futures, options, etc.) whose liquidity can be demonstrated, as well as shares of funds 
where the value is determined and reported daily.
Level 2: instruments measured based on valuation models which use observable inputs other than 
quoted prices
Level 2 comprises instruments not directly quoted on an active market, measured using a standard valuation technique incorporating parameters 
that are either directly observable (prices) or indirectly observable (price derivatives) through to maturity.
Level 3: instruments measured using models that are not commonly used and/or that draw on 
non-observable inputs
Level 3 comprises instruments which are measured, at least in part, on the basis of non-observable market data which is liable to materially impact 
the valuation.

4.5.2.1 Assets mostly held at fair value through profit or loss
EQUITY SECURITIES
In the absence of a price available on an active market, an equity security is considered to be Level 3 if a significant adjustment is made to 
parameters that are observable. Where no significant adjustment is made to those observable parameters, the security is classed as Level 2.
The normal measurement techniques of equity securities held by the Group either directly, or within its managed funds, are:
•  TRANSACTION MULTIPLES
2
The preferred measurement technique is based on transaction multiples. This technique uses recent transactions in the sector under consideration.  . B
u
Multiples are established based on the enterprise value (EV) of comparable transactions and accounting measures such as EBITDA (earnings before  s
in
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), EBIT or profit, which are applied to the asset to be measured. es
s
Transaction multiples often reflect a premium which is a consequence of the negotiation activity carried out during the transaction. MB therefore   rev
ie
applies a marketability discount to transaction multiples used to value positions retained in the portfolio. Such marketability discounts are higher  w
where MB retains a minority position in the portfolio company and cannot independently trigger a disposal. For the purpose of the IFRS 13 fair value 
hierarchy, the marketability discount is considered as an unobservable input, and, where significant, would lead to a Level 3 valuation.
•  OTHER EARNINGS MULTIPLES
This consists of applying a multiple to the earnings of the company to be valued. It is based on multiples from a sample of listed companies, which 
are in the peer group of the company to be valued. The earnings multiples used might be EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT and the price/earnings ratio (PER).
Companies in the selected peer group must operate in a similar sector to that of the target company. They are of a relatively comparable size and 
have similar growth prospects. Specific factors may also be taken into account in the selection, including country, regulatory aspects specific to each 
market, and the presence or otherwise of related business activities.
3
The value of the peer group companies is obtained by adding together the market capitalisation, net financial debt, and non-controlling interests,  . M
based on the most recently available financial data. a
n
a
g
Stock exchange multiples are calculated excluding any control premium. The valuation is made from the point of view of a non-controlling  em
shareholder. However, if the investment to be valued is not listed, the lack of liquidity relative to listed companies in the peer group may be reflected  en
through an illiquidity discount. For the purpose of the valuation hierarchy, such an illiquidity discount is considered as an unobservable discount, and,  t re
p
where significant, would mean the valuation is considered as a Level 3 valuation. o
rt
INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS WHICH HOLD INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COST
Investments which give a share of underlying assets held by a fund are classified as Level 2 where the value of underlying assets are considered  
to be Level 2.
SHARES IN EXTERNAL FUNDS
Shares of private equity funds or investments managed by third parties, for which the manager and third-party assessor have published a net 
asset value, may use a valuation technique incorporating parameters that are not directly observable, or using observable inputs with a significant 
adjustment which is not observed. Where it is not clear that the valuations have been performed using only observable inputs, the external funds are 
4
assumed to be Level 3. . F
in
a
CREDIT MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS nc
ia
Junior and subordinated tranches of securitised vehicles held directly by the Group are valued using prices obtained from active brokers and/ l s
ta
or dealers. Transactions do not necessarily occur at the indicated prices due to the nature of the securities held and their usually low transaction  te
m
volume. Therefore, these are considered to be Level 2. e
n
ts
The Group has invested in a credit investment company which invests in subordinated CLO tranches. These are valued by a third-party valuation 
provider using discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques giving a “mark to model” valuation which uses software to estimate future cashflows, based 
on a number of assumptions. Some of these assumptions, of which the default and recoverability rates are considered the most significant, are 
unobservable inputs, so this instrument is considered to be Level 3.
Other credit management investments consist mainly of investment funds and managed accounts. The majority of these are valued based on market 
prices, and are considered to be Level 2.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
DERIVATIVES
The fair value of derivatives is predominantly derived from prices or quotations of other Level 1 and Level 2 instruments, through standard market 
extrapolation or interpolation or through corroboration by real transactions. Fair value can also be derived from other standard techniques and 
models. The most frequently used measurement model is the DCF technique. The values derived from these models are materially affected by the 
measurement assumptions used, such as the amounts and settlement dates of future cash flows, the discount rates and solvency. When those 
parameters are determined on the basis of directly observable inputs, the derivatives are classified in Level 2.
4.5.2.2 Assets mostly held at amortised cost
LOANS TO/DUE TO BANKS AND CUSTOMERS
Loans to customers and their associated interest rates are compared, by maturity, with similar recent transactions and are usually held as Level 
2. In the event of a material difference in interest rates or any other factor indicating that an asset’s fair value is materially different from the net 
carrying amount, the fair value is adjusted accordingly. To determine an asset’s fair value, the Group estimates the counterparty’s default risk and 
calculates the sum of future cash flows, taking into account the debtor’s financial standing.
Repurchase agreements and amounts due to banks and customers are valued using a DCF technique, the discount rate of which is adjusted for the 
appropriate credit margin.
Impaired loans where the carrying value is determined by a DCF, using best estimates of recoverable cash flows, are classified as Level 3.
DEBT SECURITIES AND DEBT SECURITIES IN ISSUE
Debt securities are predominantly government bonds, corporate debt securities, senior tranches of securitised mortgage-backed securities, senior 
tranches of collateralised loan obligations, and certificates of deposit. They can be classified in Level 1 if listed, or Level 2 when external prices for 
the same security can be regularly observed from a reasonable number of market makers that are active in this security, but these prices do not 
represent directly tradable prices (when supplied, for example, by consensus pricing services or active brokers and/or dealers). Where prices are 
not directly observable in the market, a DCF valuation is used. The discount rate is adjusted for the applicable credit margin determined by similar 
instruments listed on an active market for comparable counterparties.

In the valuation hierarchy described above, the Group has an accounting policy of classifying its unquoted investments as Level 2 when the 
significant inputs to the valuation are observable. When there are significant unobservable inputs to the valuation, these valuations are classified 
as Level 3. Since the end of 2019, in the context of the growing importance of the Merchant Banking business to Rothschild & Co and the volatility 
of markets in the year to date, the Group has benchmarked its fair value Levels against other quoted companies and reassessed the materiality or 
otherwise of the unobservable elements in the valuations. During this exercise, the Group compared the extent to which the inputs for valuations are 
considered to be observable or not, as well as the point at which they were significant enough to cause a valuation to be in Level 3. The Group has 
not changed its valuation method during the year; nevertheless, following this exercise, certain assets with a value of €440 million were reclassified 
at the beginning of the year from Level 2 to Level 3.
Disclosure about the inputs to the valuation of Level 3 assets, including the elements which are unobservable, are made below.
The following table summarises the inputs and assumptions used for equities categorised as Level 3 assets. Where the equity investment by the 
Group is in a managed fund or in a portfolio managed by a third party, the valuation method refers to the valuation of the underlying investments  
of that fund, of which the Group has a proportionate interest.

Out of the €472 million of FVTPL equity securities classified in Level 3 as at 31 December 2020, €339 million are investments made by the Group 
in managed funds, where the underlying instruments are valued using an earnings multiple or by an external valuation. The main unobservable input 
is the liquidity/marketability discount taken off valuations which have been calculated using earnings multiples. These reflect the difference in value 
between (i) a comparable liquid share whose value can be observed; or (ii) a comparable asset valued as part of an executed transaction; and an 
asset retained in a portfolio. In general, if the discount for an asset were 15% rather than 10%, the valuation used by R&Co would be 15% lower 
than that calculated using the earnings multiple, rather than 10% lower. To further quantify the fair value sensitivity of these investments, the Group 
has determined the impact in the event of a fall of 5% in the carrying value of the underlying instruments. In such an event, there would be a pre-tax 
charge to the income statement of €19.3 million, or 5.7% of this type of asset.
Additionally, €98 million are investments in funds, for which the underlying assets are subject to a third-party valuation. Because full details of all 
the valuations are not available, the assumption is made that some elements may be unobservable, and so these are classified as Level 3; none 
of the underlying assets are individually material to the Group’s accounts. To quantify the fair value sensitivity of these instruments, measured using  2. B
unobservable inputs, the Group has determined the impact in the event of a fall of 5% in the carrying value. In such an event, there would be a pre- u
s
tax charge to the income statement of €5.0 million or 5.1%. ine
s
s
The main unobservable input to value the holding in the credit investment company is considered to be the default rate. If the average default rate   re
v
was 2.5% instead of 2.0%, the value of the holding would fall by €0.9 million or 2.5%. ie

4.5.5 Selected controls in the valuation process
Merchant Banking
The calculation of fair value is subject to control procedures aimed at verifying that fair values are determined or validated by an independent 
function. Fair values determined by reference to external quoted prices or market parameters are validated by the relevant fund’s valuation 
committee.
These committees review, at least twice a year, the valuation of the investments made by Merchant Banking. 
The parameters of valuation that are reviewed in committee include the following:
3
•  the consistency of the various sources; . M
a
•  the consistency of the valuation assumptions and of the related adjustments (if any); na
g
•  the events that took place during the period which could affect the value; and em
•  the frequency with which the data is updated.  en
t re
p
Merchant Banking funds are valued by their management companies in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital  o
rt
Valuation (IPEV) guidelines or other commonly acknowledged industry standards. As such, where applicable, these valuation committees act  
as the valuator under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) requirements.
In addition, the valuations of assets held by MB funds are reviewed and supported by statutory audits of those funds.
Valuation of derivatives
The Group’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives (i.e. non-exchange traded) are valued using external valuation models. These models calculate the 
present value of expected future cash flows. The Group’s derivative products are of a “vanilla” nature, such as interest rate swaps and cross-
currency swaps; for these, the modelling techniques used are standard across the industry. Inputs to the valuation models are determined from 
observable market data, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. 4
. F
Exchange traded derivatives are valued by the exchange on which they are traded, which asks for margin calls depending on the value. ina

Fair value hedges
3
The Group holds a portfolio of medium and long-term fixed-rate customer loans and is, therefore, exposed to changes in fair value due to movements  . Ma
n
in market interest rates. The Group manages this risk exposure by entering into interest rate swaps whereby it pays fixed rates and receives floating  a
g
rates. The Group applies hedge accounting to these derivatives, which it treats as fair value hedges. em
e
n
Only the interest risk element is hedged; other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the Group. The interest rate risk component  t re
which is hedged is the change in fair value of the medium/long-term fixed-rate customer loans arising solely from changes in EONIA (the benchmark  p
o
rate of interest). Such changes are usually the largest component of the overall change in fair value. rt
For the purposes of hedge accounting, efficiency tests are performed, prospectively at the date of designation and retrospectively at each balance 
sheet date, to ensure that there is no risk of over-coverage. The ineffectiveness of these hedges is considered immaterial and has therefore not 
been recognised in the income statement.
Most of these macro hedging swaps are carried out against EONIA and are intended to be held until maturity without periodic revision (i.e. they are 
non-dynamic). 
The following table sets out the maturity profile and average fixed rate payable on the hedging instruments that are used in the Group’s non-dynamic

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Net investment hedges
A foreign currency exposure arises from a net investment in subsidiaries that have a different functional currency from that of the Group. The risk 
arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Group’s functional currency, which 
causes the amount of the net investment to vary. This risk may have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s policy  
is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios of the Group  
and its banking subsidiaries.
The hedged risk in the Group’s net investment hedges is the risk of weakening exchange rates against the euro that would result in a reduction in 
the carrying amount of the Group’s net investment in its Swiss franc subsidiaries. 
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts as hedging instruments. The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the 
fair value of the derivatives with changes in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative. Because the Group expects to hold the net investment for a 
period longer than the maturity of the forward foreign exchange contract, and the Group policy is to hedge only a portion of the net investment, any 
ineffectiveness is expected to be immaterial.
The following table sets out the maturity profile and average exchange rate on the forward foreign exchange contracts that are used in the Group’s 
net investment hedging strategies as at 31 December 2020.

The cumulative foreign currency reserve on discontinued hedges (negative €8.9 million) will only be transferred to the P&L if the Group disposes  
of the underlying foreign operations, for which no plans exist.
Cash flow hedges
A foreign currency exposure arises in operating divisions which have a cost base in a currency that is different to its functional currency. The risk 
arises from the fluctuation in future spot rates, which would cause volatility in the Group’s income statement. This risk may have a significant impact 
on the financial statements of the Group or the affected business.
The Group has introduced a hedging programme in certain divisions to reduce the volatility caused by exchange rate movements, by entering into 
forward foreign exchange contracts. The derivatives (a cash flow hedge) are designated as a hedge of a probable forecasted transaction, being the 
foreign currency sterling costs of the operating division.
The hedged risk in the Group’s cash flow hedges is the risk of a strengthening of sterling exchange rates against the euro that would result in  
a reduction in profit. Because the Group policy is to hedge only a portion of the cost base, any ineffectiveness is expected to be immaterial.

Note 8 – Leases
The Group rents several offices around the world from which it conducts its business. The terms of these leases typically span from 5-15 years.
Many of these leases contain clauses whereby the lessee has the opportunity to extend the lease beyond the non-cancellable term of the lease  
or has the option to terminate the lease early in advance of the contractual end date. Where entities have judged that they are reasonably certain  
to utilise these options, they have included these early termination/extension options in their assessment of the lease term.
A significant proportion of the Group’s property leases are for French commercial leases. Typically, French commercial leases are signed for at least 
nine years, with unilateral termination possible by the tenant after three or six years. For this reason, this form of lease is commonly also known as 
3/6/9 in France. As the tenants of these properties are reasonably certain that they do not expect to utilise these unilateral termination options, 
they have estimated that the lease term will be for nine years.

The Group, where appropriate, subleases a proportion of these properties to entities outside the Group. . Bu

By far the most significant of the brand names is the asset related to the use of the “Rothschild & Co” name. This is considered to have an 
indefinite useful life and is, therefore, not amortised, but is instead subject to an impairment test performed at least annually.
Testing for impairment
As at 31 December 2020, the Group performed an impairment test for the “Rothschild & Co” name and additionally considered whether impairment 
losses are required due to the potential longer-term impact of COVID-19. It valued the name using the “royalty relief” method, whereby the value 
of the name is based on the theoretical amount that would be paid if the name were licensed from a third party, and not owned. Income for testing 
purposes has been determined on the basis of a three-year plan drawn up through the Group’s budget process and then extended in perpetuity  
to a terminal value, using a long-term growth rate. For the purposes of this test, the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic  
is considered to have an impact in 2020 followed by an improvement in results in 2021 and thereafter. Based on these tests, the amount by which 
the income would have to fall to cause an impairment would be 65%.
The other key assumptions used for the test and the value that would result in an impairment are:
Key assumptions  Value used  Value that will result 
in an impairment
Royalty rate  2% 0.7%
Discount rate 8%  18.5%

The Group has performed its annual impairment tests as at 31 December 2020 and additionally considered whether impairment losses are required  us
due to the potential longer-term impact of COVID-19. The tests are applied for each of the cash-generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been  ine
s
allocated. The recoverable amount of the CGUs was calculated using the most appropriate method. The results of these tests concluded that no  s re
impairment was needed on any of the Group’s goodwill. vie
w
For the main CGU covering the wider GA business, the fair value has been calculated using price/earnings (PER) multiples which have been applied 
to the normalised profits earned after tax. The value was determined using parameters derived from market conditions and based on data from 
comparable companies.
The following assumptions were used:
•  normalised profit after tax is determined over the last three years; and
•  trading multiples used were medium-term PER multiples of M&A-focused peers.
 
The valuation technique would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The performance of the GA business has been resilient through the COVID-19 crisis, and results of sensitivity tests on this CGU show that either the 
3
PER or the normalised profit would have to decrease by 60% for an impairment to be considered. . M
a
n
Parameters used to value other CGUs have been derived from market conditions and based on data from comparable companies. For these other  a

CGUs, the weighted average amount by which the estimated value of that CGU exceeds its carrying value is 260%, with a minimum value of 18%. em

From time to time, the Group is involved in legal proceedings or receives claims arising from the conduct of its business. Based upon available 
information and, where appropriate, legal advice, provisions are made where it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required and the 
amount can be reliably estimated.
Also within provisions for claims and litigation are amounts set aside to cover estimated costs of other legal proceedings and claims arising from  
the conduct of business.
Management believes that the level of provisions made in these financial statements continues to be sufficient for any potential or actual 
proceedings or claims which are likely to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements, based on information available at the reporting date.

Note 18 – Structured entities
A structured entity is one which has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity.  
It will often have restricted activities and a narrow or well-defined objective and can include some investment funds.
In most cases, it is clear under IFRS 10 that the Group need not consolidate its investments in structured entities. However, some structured 
entities are managed by the Group in the form of funds in which the Group’s own money is also invested. In these situations, a judgment must  
be made as to whether there is a need to consolidate these funds or not. To do this, a combined assessment of two key indicators is made:
•  remuneration and other economic interests in aggregate; and
•  kick-out rights.
To assess economic interests, it is considered, at a particular level of returns, how much of any further increase in the performance of a fund 
accrues to the manager (“the variability of the economic interest”). The level of returns at which this is measured is the level at which performance 
fees begin to accrue.
A high level of variability would support the conclusion that a manager might be a principal (and would probably consolidate the managed fund). 
Meanwhile, a low level of variability would indicate that a manager might be an agent for the other investors (and would probably not consolidate).
Additionally, negligible rights for the investors to remove the manager or transfer their funds might indicate that a manager is a principal (and would 
probably consolidate) while strong rights might suggest that a manager is an agent (and would probably not consolidate).
The Group’s judgment is guided by both IFRS 10 and its understanding of market practice.

Preferred shares within NCoI mainly consist of amounts calculated in accordance with statutory clauses applicable to French limited partnerships of 
the Group including Rothschild Martin Maurel SCS, the French holding company of our WAM and GA businesses located in France, and its relevant 
subsidiaries. The distributed profit share (préciput) is based on the partnerships’ individual local earnings.
Preferred shares issued by R&CoCL a number of years ago were repaid in March 2019 at fair value, and the proceeds of €27.1 million are included 
in the 2019 distributions in the table above. As this was a transaction with shareholders, the uplift in fair value on repayment was charged directly  
to shareholders’ funds in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

payment of the interest. Under IFRS, these instruments are considered to be equity instruments and are shown as part of NCoI because they were  e

issued by subsidiaries and not held by the Group. The interest payable, net of tax relief, on these instruments is shown as a charge to NCoI. The  t re

The NMR Pension Fund (“UK Fund”) is operated by NMR for the benefit of employees of certain Group companies in the United Kingdom. This fund  cia
includes a defined benefit section, which closed to new entrants in 2003. l s

te
The NMR Overseas Pension Fund (“Overseas Fund”) is operated for the benefit of employees of certain Group companies outside the United  m
e
Kingdom. The defined benefit section also closed to new entrants in 2003. The employees in the Overseas Fund stopped earning additional defined  n
ts
benefit pensions in 2017. Benefits built up by former in-service members will increase between the date of closure and each member’s retirement 
date in line with the standard deferred revaluation in the fund’s rules.
Rothschild & Co North America Inc maintains an unfunded qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and other pension agreements for 
certain employees (“US Fund”). Neither the plan nor the pension agreements provide for health or other benefits for employees or retirees. The last 
time that new benefits were accrued was 2001.
R&CoBZ also operates funded pension schemes (“Swiss Funds”). These schemes have been set up on the basis of the Swiss method of defined 
contributions but have certain characteristics of a defined benefit pension plan. Current employees and pensioners (former employees or their 
surviving partners) receive benefits upon retiring as well as in the event of death or invalidity. These benefits are financed through employer and 
employee contributions.
Additionally, certain companies in the Group have smaller unfunded obligations in respect of pensions and other post–employment benefits.
The latest formal actuarial valuations of the UK Fund and the Overseas Fund were carried out as at 31 March 2019. The value of the defined benefit 
obligation has been updated to 31 December 2020 by qualified independent actuaries. Valuations of the Swiss Funds are performed for each 
closing, also by qualified actuaries.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
The defined benefit obligations expose the Group to a number of risks, including longevity, inflation, interest rate and investment performance. These 
risks are mitigated where possible by applying an investment strategy for the funded schemes which aims to minimise the long-term costs. This is 
achieved by investing in a diversified selection of asset classes, which aims to reduce the volatility of returns and also achieves a level of matching 
with the underlying liabilities. The matching assets, which the funded schemes invest in, include corporate bonds, government gilts and a specific 
liability-driven investment mandate, which provide a partial hedge of the funds’ interest rate and inflation exposure. Overall, the objective is to select 
assets which will generate income and capital growth to fund the cost of current – and, where applicable, future – benefits payable by the funds. The 
choice of assets also reflects factors such as the funding position and whether the Fund is closed to future accrual.

Following the March 2019 triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Fund, the trustees of the defined benefit pension fund have agreed a contribution 
plan with the Group to reduce the resulting deficit in accordance with pensions regulation. The aim is to eliminate the funding deficit by 2023 with 
€16.7 million of additional contributions per year, although from March 2021 the contributions will be reviewed on the basis of the funding position 
of the UK Fund. In addition, participating employers in the fund have agreed to pay 55.2% of in-service members’ pensionable salaries in respect  
of future accruals.

The Overseas Fund is in surplus on the agreed funding assumptions. Following its March 2019 triennial valuation, it was agreed that no 
contributions need to be made other than to cover certain expenses of the Overseas Fund.
It is estimated that total contributions of €34 million will be paid to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes in the twelve months ending 
31 December 2021.
The Group has assessed that no further liability arises for the UK, Overseas and Swiss Funds under IFRIC 14 – IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined 
Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction. This conclusion was reached because the trustees of the UK and Overseas 
Funds do not have a unilateral power to wind up the fund and the fund’s rules allow the sponsoring company an unconditional right to a refund 
assuming the gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time until all members have left the fund. Meanwhile, the plan assets of the Swiss Funds 
contain a repurchase value of CHF3.5 million, resulting from a reinsurance contract with Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, Zurich (Zurich Insurance). 
Zurich Insurance does not have a unilateral power to wind up the reinsurance contract. 2
. B
The net pension asset in the Swiss Funds is expected to become available to the Group because the statutory employer contributions do not fully  us
cover the employer service cost according to IAS 19. According to IFRIC 14, the maximum economic benefit is the capitalised value of the difference  ine
s
between the employer service cost and the expected employer’s contributions to the fund for the following financial year. s re

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
The value placed on the defined benefit net liabilities and assets is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used. Those assumptions that have the 
most significant impact on the measurement of the liability, along with an illustration of the sensitivity to each assumption, are as follows:
31/12/2020
In thousands of euros UK and Swiss
Overseas Funds
0.5% increase in discount rate (113,000) (18,000)
0.5% increase in inflation 95,000 1,000
One year increase in life expectancy 55,000 n/a
The sensitivities shown above reflect only an estimate of the change in the assessed defined benefit obligation for the funds. In practice, any 
movement leading to a change in the discount rate or price inflation is likely to be partially offset by a change in asset values, and the corresponding 
overall impact on the net liability is therefore likely to be lower than the amounts above.

Note 23 – Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
The following table shows the impact (1) on the consolidated balance sheet of offsetting assets and liabilities with the same counterparties. 
Amounts are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it intends either to settle the asset and 
liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The table also indicates (2) amounts subject to a master netting agreement, which may be offset in the event of the default of one of the counterparties, 
but whose characteristics make them ineligible for offsetting under IFRS. Fair values of financial instruments and collateral here are capped at the 
net book value of the balance sheet exposure, so as to avoid any over-collateralisation effect. This part of the table (“net amount”) is provided to 
indicate where master netting agreements mitigate the Group’s exposure to financial instruments in the event of default by the counterparty. The Group 
also uses other risk mitigation strategies, such as holding collateral against its loans, but these are not disclosed in this table.

Staff costs
As part of its variable pay strategy, the Group pays bonuses to employees. In some cases, the cash payment is deferred to future years.
In most circumstances, deferred cash awards are paid one, two and three years after the year of the award, and the expense is recognised over 
the two, three and four-year periods from the start of the year of the award to the date of payment. These awards are paid on the condition that the 
recipient is still an employee of the Group. For certain employees, a portion of the bonus will be settled in the form of a non-cash instrument. There 
are two forms of non-cash instruments in the R&Co Group, used in response to the Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD4). Firstly, an equity- 
settled deferred share award consisting of R&Co shares: the R&Co shares are released to the employees six months after the vesting date of the 
award. Secondly, a cash-settled share-linked cash award (non-deferred): this vests immediately but the value of the amount paid moves in line with 
the R&Co share price over a six month holding period. Occasionally, in certain circumstances, the Group allows employees to accelerate the vesting 
of deferred cash awards, and in this case, the uncharged expense is recognised immediately.
A commitment to employees exists in connection with deferred remuneration. Some of this has not yet accrued because it relates to a future service 
period. The amount of potential future payments that have not yet accrued is €97.1 million (€109.7 million as at 31 December 2019).
The objective of the deferred share-based payment awards is to link the reward of certain key staff with the performance of the Group. In addition to 
the requirement to remain employed by the Group, these awards may also be cancelled under specific circumstances.
R&Co Equity Scheme
R&Co also operates Equity Schemes for some of its senior staff. Equity Scheme participants are required to invest in R&Co shares and, for each 
share owned, they are granted four share options. The shares are subject to a three-year to four-year lock-up period and the share options granted 
are subject to a vesting period before exercise. Some staff use deferred cash awards to fund their investment in the R&Co shares. In this case,  
the element of the deferred awards they use that has not yet been expensed at the point of purchase is recognised over the lock-up period.

The fair value of the share-based payment made was €nil (31 December 2019: €2.6 million). Fair values are charged to the income statement over 
the period of employee service required under the vesting conditions. As the options are equity-settled, there is no liability booked in the balance 
sheet in respect of these options, and there is no periodic charge or credit in the income statement as the employees’ options change in value.
On issuance, options are valued by an independent valuer using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The key inputs into this model are the price 
of the underlying R&Co shares, the expected volatility of the share price (for which the historic volatility has been the primary consideration), and the 
estimated exercise date of the options (which is assumed to be the mid-point between the dates of vesting and expiry). The valuation is based on 
the assumption that all recipients will remain with the Group.

The charge arising in the period that relates to share-based payments is included in the line Compensation and other staff costs, and amounts to  . F

Note 34 – Segmental information
The table below presents a segmental analysis by business line, used internally for assessing business performance, which is then adjusted to 
conform to the Group’s statutory accounting policies. The reconciliation to IFRS mainly reflects: the treatment of profit share (préciput) paid to French 
partners as non-controlling interests; accounting for deferred bonuses over the period that they are earned; the application of IAS 19 for defined 
benefit pension schemes; adding back non-operating gains and losses booked in “net income/(expense) from other assets” or administrative 
expenses; and reallocating impairments and certain operating income and expenses for presentational purposes.

Diluted average number of shares in issue – 000s 72,254 72,049
Earnings per share – diluted (euro) 2.19 3.35
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing Net income – Group share (after removing accrued profit share (préciput), which is not part  
of the distributable profit available to shareholders) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. The préciput adjustment  
is spread evenly over the reporting period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury share method, whereby net income is divided by the sum of the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding plus the bonus number of shares that would be issued through dilutive option or share awards. Share options and 
awards which are dilutive are those which are in the money, based on the average share price during the period. The majority of potential shares 
which are not dilutive are connected to the Rothschild & Co Equity Scheme.
As there were no gains or losses on discontinued activities, the earnings per share on continuing activities are the same as earnings per share.

Rothschild & Co | Annual Report 2020   241
Notes to the Company financial statements 
I. Highlights of the financial year 
R&Co ended the 2020 calendar year with net income of €84.5 million, compared with €309.4 million in the prior year.
For the year ended 31 December 2020, the Company received dividends of €121.8 million from its French subsidiaries (Paris Orléans Holding 
Bancaire (POHB) €73.9 million; K Développement €38.6 million; Martin Maurel €7.3 million; and Rothschild Martin Maurel €2.1 million), versus 
€345.2 million for the previous year.
The focus of the R&Co Group throughout the COVID-19 crisis has been and remains the safety and welfare of the colleagues and the needs of the 
clients. R&Co and its subsidiaries were able to move swiftly into a home-working set-up for all of our employees without major impact on productivity. 
In addition, the R&Co Group has undertaken actions to limit the adverse effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this context, the overall impact on 
revenue is not significant and the activity remains at the 2019 level. The additional costs related to this health crisis (social distance and increased 
hygiene measures), offset by savings (travel), did not have a significant impact on operating income.
II. Subsequent events
No significant adjusting events have occurred after 31 December 2020 closing date.
III. Accounting principles and valuation methods
To abide by principles of going concern, conservatism and reliability, and to ensure consistency of accounting methods from one reporting period to 
the next, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of French law and with French generally accepted accounting 
principles.
The financial statements have been approved in accordance with Financial Regulation 2014-03 modified by regulations 2015-06 and 2016-07 from 
the French Accounting Standards Authority (Autorité des normes comptables). 
The income statement is presented in accordance with the ‘TIAP’ model, as recommended by the French Accounting Standards Authority for  
financial companies.
Income transactions are split in two: firstly, operating income transactions, followed by other income transactions (primarily financial transactions).
Current income corresponds to ‘income from ordinary activities’, i.e. all activities in which the company engages in the normal course of its 
business, and any related activities that it carries out on an add-on basis or as an extension of its ordinary activities.
Operating profit does, however, include non-recurring income and expenses from events which are clearly separate from the Company’s ordinary 
activities and which are not, therefore, deemed to occur on a frequent or regular basis.
Capital transactions include transactions concerning holdings classified as non-current assets.
The main accounting policies applied are as follows:
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are valued at their acquisition cost and amortised and depreciated in the following manner:
Estimated   Method
useful life
Start-up costs 3 years straight-line
Software 3 years straight-line
Buildings 20 to 30 years straight-line
Leasehold and general improvements 8 to 10 years straight-line
Vehicles 5 years straight-line
Office equipment 3 years reducing-balance
Office furniture 10 years straight-line

Non-current financial assets are valued at their acquisition cost. The values of holdings denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euro 
at the exchange rate on the transaction date. All loans and receivables denominated in foreign currencies that are classified among non-current 
financial assets are translated at the closing rate for the financial year.
Investments in Group and other companies and portfolio holdings are recognised at their acquisition cost. An impairment loss is recognised when 
fair value is below acquisition cost.
The fair values of investments in Group and other companies and portfolio holdings are calculated in the following manner:
•  treasury stock and other listed securities: Average quoted price of the last month before the closing; 
•  unlisted securities: market value. This is obtained using either the Company’s share of book net assets, or re-appraised net assets of the 
investment, or the price used for a recent transaction in the security;
2
•  funds: an impairment is recognised when the acquisition cost or total investment in the fund exceeds the Company’s share of the fund’s adjusted  . B
net asset value as certified by the fund’s auditors or the redemption value as determined by the issuer. The portion of unrealised capital losses  us
linked to currency effects is recognised separately from impairment, which relates solely to changes in the value of the underlying assets. ine
s
s
The value of the portfolio at 31 December 2020 was measured using the same methodology as applied in the preceding financial year. Dividends   re
v
are recorded in the month in which it is decided to distribute them. iew
Regarding private equity funds, in accordance with market practice, only amounts actually called up are recorded in the balance sheet, and the 
unfunded capital commitment is recorded as an off-balance sheet item.
Sales of treasury shares, shareholdings, long-term portfolio holdings or investment securities are recognised using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method, i.e. the longest-held securities will be deemed to be the first sold.
Receivables are recognised at their nominal value. An impairment loss is recognised when the value is lower than the carrying cost. Receivables 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate for the financial year.
Marketable securities are recognised initially at their acquisition cost. When their overall value is lower than their acquisition cost, an impairment 
loss is recognised.

Notes to the Company financial statements
3. O  ff-balance-sheet commitments in connection with the acquisition of Martin Maurel SA 
(MM) shares from certain managers
Between 1 June 2016 and 10 June 2016 R&Co signed memoranda of understanding with a number of managers at MM including commitments  
to buy and sell MM shares held by these managers and unavailable as a result of the legal obligation to hold these shares until the fifth anniversary 
of their payment into the Martin Maurel group savings plan.
In accordance with the stipulations of these memoranda of understanding, Rothschild & Co is entitled to buy these MM shares in the month 
following the date that the restriction to various managers is lifted. 
As the restricted shares are paid into the Martin Maurel group savings plan staggered over several years, the scheduled availability of shares on  
a staggered basis was between 12 March 2017 and 22 March 2021.
R&Co notified managers for whom the shares’ restricted period ended on 12 March 2017, with the promise to buy these shares being exercised  
on 31 March 2017. Accordingly, during the 2020 financial year, R&Co acquired 15,647 MM shares, representing 1.25% of MM’s share capital,  
held by 16 MM managers, for €4.1 million in total consideration.
These promises initially covered a total number of 39,417 MM shares, which represented a commitment estimated at €9.7 million. Following 
the exercise of these options, there remain 8,247 MM shares subject to put and call options that R&Co is entitled to buy, which may be acquired 
according to the terms and conditions laid down in the preliminary agreements. These represent a commitment of €2.3 million for R&Co.
