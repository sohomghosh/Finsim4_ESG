NOTE T he economic, environmental, and social GRI “Topic-Specific Standards” shown in the table are only those deemed “material”. When indicators are placed in 
brackets next to a GRI topic this means that only the indicators shown in the table apply, or, where not specified, all the indicators related to the topic apply (also 
see the GRI Content Index). For “Acea material topics” as identified in the table by a number, reference should be made to the figure showing the materiality matrix 
(chart no. 1).
7   It is important to consider that both the specific GRI Standards – each of which includes a description of the management method and a number of indicators – and 
Acea material topics both refer to contents that are far more complex and detailed than their brief name may suggest which, given their level of detail, cannot be 
presented at this time. See the GRI Standards – Consolidated set of GRI Sustainability reporting standards for 2016 – on the website www.globalreporting.org, also in 
Italian: Raccolta consolidata dei GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2019.
8   This led, for example, to the exclusion of the Specific Standards related to Market Presence, Tax and Human Rights which, according to the meaning given to them by the 
GRI, are more pertinent to multinational enterprises and not suited to the reality of the Group’s most significant operations. 
9   In 2018, with the obligation to apply them to financial year 2020, the specific standards “Water and Effluents 2018” and “Occupational Health and Safety 2018”, 
both reported, were updated. Specifically, the updated edition of the Water and Effluents standard also superseded some indicators previously provided for under the 
“Effluents and Waste 2016” standard.

The results of the ERM Programme are also taken into account 
when planning actions to mitigate risks and seize opportunities 
by Group Companies with certified Management Systems.
The ERM processes allow for constant interaction between the

tion and the focal points in the Risk & Compliance Units of the 
Operating Companies (see chart no. 14).

The boxes below illustrate the most significant interactions between Acea and the main categories of stakeholders in 2020.
Acea is one of the main Italian multi-utilities by territory and customers served 
with 1.2 million customers in the energy sector and over 210,000 customers in gas, 
CUSTOMERS
approximately 1.6 million withdrawal points for energy distribution and 2.7 million water 
users, equal to 8.6 million inhabitants served – for all water Companies operating in Italy. 
In the face of such significant numbers, Acea is committed to customer care in each step 
of the relationship. From developing more advanced interaction dynamics, as is happening with the prosumer – a figure that is both 
a customer and energy producer – up by 8% compared to the previous year, to promoting and managing socially useful tools, such 
as the Water and Energy Bonus, to monitoring customer satisfaction, Acea places the customer at the centre of its activities. The 
emergency caused by Covid-19 further developed the Group’s customer care in order to contribute to reducing the risk of infection 
as much as possible, in addition to guaranteeing operating activities during lockdown. To do so, further upgrades were made to the 
digital channels: the MyAcea App was installed by around 290,000 people (+61% compared to 2019), and the booking services 
at the branch in the headquarters and digital service points were developed with the same services as the physical branch through 
video calls with an Acea operator. The shift towards remote methods also saw positive effects on electronic billing which led to paper 
savings of 105.5 tonnes in the year (+92% compared to 2019). Customer support measures were also significant, especially in terms 
of the economic sustainability of bills following the Covid-19 emergency: in addition to the ARERA measures, such as interrupting 
the suspension of electric power and natural gas supplies for late payment during the period of maximum emergency, the Acea 
energy and water Companies voluntarily adopted extraordinary measures with regard to payments by their customers throughout 
Italy, suspending debt collection measures and introducing the possibility of instalment plans. The transparency in the illustration of its 
sustainable governance and sustainability performance was particularly appreciated by consumers, who added the Acea Sustainability 
Report to the Index Future Respect 2020.
72 ACEA GROUP / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020
For a Company that delivers essential public services, mostly subject to regulation by the 
public authorities, the relationship with institutions is of fundamental importance both for 
INSTITUTIONS planning and performing the Company activities. In this context, for example, we note the 
activities that led to the preparation of the final project for the new section of the Peschi-
era, submitted by Acea Ato 2 for review by the authority responsible for overseeing public 
works, and the preparation of the Water Safety Plans (WSPs) sent to the Ministry of Health.
Acea is active in the prevention and management of critical events and in the event of an emergency it provides support to the authorities 
responsible for public health, civil protection and public safety, for example through plans for managing emergencies of the water com-
panies, shared with local institutions (such as Governmental Territorial Offices, Local Health Authorities, Area Management Agencies), 
or the electricity companies, which are essential for restarting the system in the event of a blackout of the National Transmission Grid or 
re-establishing power for strategic users, such as institutions and hospitals.
Interactions also take place through research projects with public bodies: in 2020, Acea participated in the activities of the Italian Research 
and Industrial Development Centre (AIRES), a network of companies, institutions and technology consortia engaged in the development 
of a circular economy and environmental sustainability, and the Italian Phosphorus Platform promoted by the Italian Ministry of the Envi-
ronment and managed by ENEA.

with 125 objectives. The Group scheduled developments in all business segments: in the water segment, aiming to qualify as a 
Smart Water Company, with virtuous processes of resource protection and management optimisation, using the leverage effect of 
innovation; in the energy segment, with the development of renewable photovoltaic sources, in favour of the decarbonisation of 
energy production, advanced systems to manage demand and increase the resilience of the grid; in the environmental segment, 
with development initiatives, from a circular economy perspective, on multi-materials and local composting.
Acea is careful to maintain an internal organisational infrastructure (procedures, rules, structures) that is efficient and adequate 
for emerging needs. Particularly worthy of note is the full implementation during the year of the Ethics Officer, a collective 
Group Body that pursues Company ethics and the constant evolution of Company risk oversight, including sustainability risks. 
The Group’s commitment was also recognised by important awards such as the Top Utility Award for Sustainability, the Premio 
Imprese per l’Innovazione promoted by Confindustria and the Premio dei premi of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
The relationship with the capital markets guarantees the best conditions thanks 
SHAREHOLDERS  to a careful diversification of sources. About 78% of the debt stems from bond 
placement operations. With reference to bank loans, Acea mainly borrows from 
AND FINANCIERS
institutional operators, such as EIB and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, worth around 
14%, whose mission is to support strategic infrastructure. Relationships with 
analysts, credit rating agencies and investors are frequently monitored in the most important financial markets: in 2020, meetings, 
investor conferences and roadshows were organised with around 220 investors and sell side analysts, both equity and credit, in addition 
to conference calls for the presentation of results (annual and interim) and the presentation of the 2020-2024 Business Plan. The 
attention of sustainable investors is growing, representing nearly 5% of the share capital and 35% of institutional investors. Acea 
confirmed its score (A-) in the CDP and improved both its outlook (positive) and long-term expected rating (EE+) of the rating awarded 
by Standard Ethics. The Company was included in the 15 top EU listed multi-utilities that make up the SE European Multi-Utilities Index.
Acea’s performance was assessed by important sustainability analysts such as Sustainalytics, VigeoEiris, MSCI, FTSE Russell ESG, 
Refinitiv and the GEI of Bloomberg.
Lastly, it should be noted that at the end of 2020, preparatory activities were carried out for the first issue of sustainable financial 
instruments, through the definition of a Green Financing Framework, which led to the issue of the first Acea Green Bond in January 
2021.
In 2020, the value of contracts for goods, services and works procured was around € 1.2 billion, 
with over 2,500 suppliers. 76% of volumes managed at central level were procured through the 
SUPPLIERS 
use of competitive tendering procedures (equal to 86% of the total). With reference to supplier 
payment times, 65% of the amounts were settled on the due date, while in the remaining cases 
an average delay of 42 days was recorded. The protection of staff employed by the suppliers was subject to specific measures, particularly 
following the Covid-19 emergency: in addition to signing specific protocols with trade unions, initiatives were activated to mitigate the 
epidemic risk and to increase controls on anti-infection measures in the worksites, and awareness-raising activities were carried out among 
contractors. For supplier assessment during execution of the contract, Acea implemented the Group Vendor Rating which will also monitor 
sustainability with a composite indicator developed with Ecovadis. For all tenders relating to works, as well as for numerous contracts for 
goods and services, suppliers must have an ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 certified management system. Furthermore, evaluation elements 
have been included for 149 product categories of goods, works and services in the tender where applicable, based on: UNI EN 14001 – 
UNI CEI 50001 – ISO 37001 – FSC Chain of Custody. Lastly, it should be noted that AdF, a Group water Company operating in the 
area of Grosseto and Siena, launched the Circular Economy Protocol, drafted with the involvement of the stakeholders and intended to 
protect local suppliers and develop the quality and socio-environmental sustainability of the supply chain. It also launched the first tender 
under a procurement code dedicated to the innovative start-ups and SMEs in the Acea registers, specifically in the “Robotics” and “Digital 
Infrastructure” categories. 
CORPORATE IDENTITY 73
Employees are the Company’s most important asset. Acea is committed to 
EMPLOYEES creating the best conditions of stability, promoting safety and developing a sense of 
cohesion and participation in the Company’s mission. The percentage of resources 
with a permanent contract in 2020 is 98%. 472 people were hired (367 men and 
105 women), 77% of which with a permanent contract. 36% of newly hired staff during the year were aged 30 or under.
The presence of women is 23% of the total workforce. Considering the governing bodies (Board of Directors, Board of 
Statutory Auditors and 231 Supervisory Bodies), the percentage of women in the Companies within the scope is 35%.
We confirm the steady increase of university graduates, who make up 25% of the total (23% in 2019).
Acea actively promotes corporate well-being, starting with the needs of its staff, which are identified over time through 
surveys. In 2020, the Group Welfare Plan was strengthened, enriching the offer of services to individuals and families; Acea 
has redeployed part of the tax relief enjoyed thanks to the Welfare Plan for the benefit of employees.
The unique circumstances imposed by the pandemic brought the Company even closer to its people with initiatives such as 
remote individual and collective psychological support and actions in support of parenting. The health crisis was faced with 
special organisational measures, such as the creation of a Prevention and Management Committee, the reformulation of work 
spaces and methods, the administration of free blood tests, which saw around 3,000 employees take part, plus, in addition to 
the healthcare policy, a Covid-19 insurance policy for employees and their family members and the adoption and subsequent 
certification of the Biosafety Trust model relating to processes in order to reduce the risk of epidemics in the workplace to a 
minimum.
Remote working, previously trialled by the Company before the emergency, was quickly extended to over 3,700 employees 
(around 60% of the total) and online working methods were also adopted for traditionally “in person” processes such as staff 
recruitment and training. 
The natural context is the framework within which Acea’s activities find their origin, 
ENVIRONMENT purpose and limit. The main challenges for environmental sustainability are indicated 
in the Green Deal, the European Union’s growth strategy, which sets the goal of cli-
mate neutrality by 2050, through progressive transformation of the economy, with 
large-scale investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, transport with low 
environmental impact and upgrading of buildings, in the context of a circular economy, with inclusivity and innovation as universal foun-
dations. In this context, Acea undertook a plan to significantly increase generation from renewables and set itself a target of achieving 
high efficiency in internal end uses and in energy process uses and reducing carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh produced). More specifically, 
in 2020 Acea Produzione purchased some photovoltaic systems for 16 MW of power, reaching a total of 52.5 MW.
The protection of biodiversity is a focus point for institutions (EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and Sustainable Finance Taxonomy), 
to which Acea responded by analysing over 23,000 sites, for the main operating companies, and mapping those located in areas with 
high biodiversity then identifying the potential risks and impact. In Environment operations, Acea also launched the Urbees project, to 
monitor the ecosystem by observing the behaviour of bees as bioindicator insects.
In the water sector, it is important to highlight the design of infrastructure of strategic importance in Peschiera, together with that of the 
Marcio Aqueduct, following the Envision protocol procedures, the first rating system for the creation of sustainable infrastructure, which 
assesses the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the infrastructure.
In terms of the circular economy, two relevant projects were initiated during the year, Sludge Mining and NANOBOND, both dedi-
cated to the management and disposal of treatment sludge, the first with the aim of recovering valuable material from waste treatment 
and from dredging sediments in waterways, and the second project with developing innovative treatment materials with eco-friendly and 
eco-sustainable characteristics.
With reference to climate change, Acea implemented an alignment with the Recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD); these guidelines formed the groundwork for defining a target to reduce climate-altering emissions ac-
cording to scientific methods (a Science-Based Target). Lastly, again focused on the issue of containing the climate risk, we note the 
appeal by the Corporate Leaders Group signed by the CEO of Acea and addressed to the European Commission to support a more 
challenging objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.
The Group’s mission and values include dialogue with the local territories and 
communities, seeking opportunities to create shared value. In 2020, Acea con-
COMMUNITY
tinued the stakeholder engagement project with two pilot projects carried out at 
the Companies Gori and Acea Ambiente, in the first instance to create a model 
for strategic interaction with the mayors in the municipalities of the Sarno area, 
and secondly to define the Stakeholder Register for the two substantial operating sites. New generations and schools  have always 
been a particular area of attention for the Group, even more so given Italy’s current circumstances. The “Acea Scuola – Difen-
diAMO l’acqua!” [“Acea School – Let’s Defend Water!”] programme, dedicated to saving water and sustainability, was carried 
out at 3 virtual events that could be accessed from across the country, with 4,000 participants. In this year of great crisis, Acea 
wanted to support the local authorities that worked on the front line, by offering ample technical and financial support to impor-
tant hospitals, such as Policlinico Gemelli and Istituto Nazionale Malattie Infettive Spallanzani, and for associations engaged in 
the protection of fragility and primary needs, such as AISM, Community of Sant’Egidio and the Italian Red Cross. Contact with 
the local region also continued through strong support from Acea in the sporting events that were able to take place during the 
year, such as the Golden Gala, the Six Nations and the Italian Paralympic championships. As every year, the initiatives aimed at 
children, Acea Volleyball School and Acea Camp, were also supported.
Lastly, we note the sense of cohesion, unity and solidarity provided by Acea to the local community by projecting the colours of 
the national flag onto Italy’s main symbolic government and institutional buildings.

41   Where due, automatic compensation is paid to the customer by deduction from the amount charged in the first subsequent bill and if needed in following bills, or paid 
by direct remittance. In any case, such automatic compensation must always be paid to the customer within 6 months from the date of receipt of the written complaint 
or the request for reimbursement of double billing, with the exception of customers who are billed quarterly, for which the term is set at 8 months. For distribution 
activities, automatic compensation is paid by the distributor to the service recipient within 7 months from the date on which the required service is provided.
42   The amount set by the Authority for compensation for non-compliance with the specific quality standards for the distribution service starts from a basic amount of 
€ 35 for domestic low voltage customers; € 70 for non-domestic low voltage customers and € 140 for medium voltage customers. In the event of non-compliance 
with the specific quality standards of the sale, the seller shall pay the final customer an automatic compensation of € 25. Compensation grows in relation to the delay 
in the provision of the service.
43   In order to be entitled to compensation, medium voltage customers must prove that they have installed protection devices at their plants that can prevent any inter-
ruption caused by faults in their utility plants from having repercussions on the Areti network, damaging other customers connected nearby. Furthermore, they must 
send their own plant adequacy statement, issued by parties with specific technical and professional expertise. Where customers fail to meet the requirements whereby 
compensation may be sought, that amount is paid by Areti as a fine to the Energy and Environmental Services Fund.

after consolidation, and € 12 million attributable to Gesesa). In 2020, the total amount of orders for Gori, Gesesa and AdF, included for the first time in this reporting 
cycle, was € 177 million (about € 60 million for AdF, about € 101 million for Gori and about € 16 million for Gesesa).
69   The Acea Code of Ethics, approved by the Board of Directors, is shared on the Company intranet and is available online at www.gruppo.acea.it, “Governance” section. 
The Code devotes article 15 to suppliers, as well as numerous other references in the text. Particular attention is paid to social safeguards in higher-risk contexts: “In 
supply contracts with at-risk countries, defined as such by recognised organizations, contractual clauses have been introduced that involve: compliance of the supplier with 
specific social obligations (e.g. measures that guarantee employees respect for their fundamental rights, the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination, protection 
against child labour)” (Code of Ethics, art. 15.2).

Regulations consistent with the principles of the EU Treaty for the protection of competition. Finally, for tenders that do not fall within the scope of application of the

ANALYSIS OF PROCUREMENTS AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN
SCOPE 
The information and data presented in the paragraph in an aggregated manner, for 2020 data, concern all companies included in the scope – please 
see Disclosing Sustainability: Methodological Note – including the three companies operating in the water sector, Gesesa, Gori and AdF, which are 
not managed centrally, whose data, where available, have been aggregated for ease of comparison with 2019 data. The two-year period was also 
illustrated according to the new division by business areas, which come into place in 2020. Some more detailed data related to the 2019 supply 
chain analysis, and for which full aggregation could not be performed, instead refer only to the centrally-managed scope (accounting for 88% of 
the 2019 order value). This is specified in the text.

80   To obtain a comparison, if one removes the 2020 orders/contracts data for the AdF contribution (1,735 orders/contracts), the largest in the new scope, a total of 4,817 
orders/contracts is obtained, and this can be compared with the 2019 figure, which includes the contribution from Gori and Gesesa (1,068 orders/contracts for Gori 
and 756 for Gesesa), and comes to 4,667, with evidence of a slight increase. Similarly, by removing the 2020 figure for the number of suppliers from AdF’s contri-
bution (421 suppliers), one obtains a total of 2,103 suppliers which, when compared to the 2019 figure of 2,062, including Gori and Gesesa (414 and 186 suppliers, 
respectively), it would mirror the slight increase.
81   For the 2019 figures managed at the centralised level, equivalent to 88% of the supply, supplier distribution was equivalent to 33% in northern Italy, 57% in central Italy 
and 8% in southern Italy and the islands, although this is not directly comparable with 2020.

97  T he low amount of revenue, and consequently the taxes paid, in relation to the Group’s activities in foreign countries has led to the overseas companies being reported 
as non-material from an economic/financial point of view; in addition, the potential evolution of the sector and other strategic and representative criteria regarding 
the Group’s development and main impacts, have resulted in them not being included within the scope of the Consolidated Non-Financial Disclosure. Moreover, this 
ensures that the issue of Taxes relating to GRI 207 is not included among the material issues (economic and governance) identified in the last materiality analysis cycle 
performed by Acea. Although the issue introduced by GRI 207, on Taxes, was not included among the material issues with the involvement of stakeholders and man-
agers, and therefore does not appear in the GRI Content Index, it is in any case mentioned here as testament to transparency and good accounting practice.

105   The Protected Natural Areas (EUAP) at national level are those areas recognised officially by the State pursuant to Framework Law 394/91. The Natura 2000 
Network, established pursuant to “Habitat” Directive 92/43/EEC, is the main policy instrument of the European Union for the conservation of biodiversity. It is 
composed of Sites of Community Interest (SCIs) which are then designated as Special Conservation Zones (SCZs), and also includes the Special Protection Areas 
(SPAs), established by “Birds” Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds. The areas composing the Natura 2000 network are not reserves where 
human activities are excluded: the Directives intend to guarantee the protection of nature whilst also taking “account of economic, social and cultural requirements 
and regional and local characteristics”.
106  Where SCIs/SCZs and SPAs coincide, the areas are counted once amongst SCIs/SCZs.

107   There are 11 risk categories, from Extinct (EX), applied to species for which there is definitive evidence that the last individual example has died, and Extinct in the Wild (EW), assigned 
to species for which there are no longer natural populations but only individuals in captivity, through to the category Least Concern (LC), applied for species that are not at risk of 
extinction in the short or medium term. Between the categories of Extinct and Least Concern, there are the threatened categories, which identify species at progressive risk of 
extinction in the short or medium term: Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR).

in consumption of the Company Gori, which in 2019 acquired the management of various plants previously managed by the Campania regional authority, as well 
as the low rainfall during the year.

(*)   The 2019 figures for the Tor di Valle and Terni Plants have been corrected after the ETS certification, while the 2020 figure is estimated pending certifi-
cation by a third-party body. 
(**)   The figure includes the emissions of the ancillary services of the waste-to-energy plants, not strictly related to the production of electricity, of Acque 
Industriali, and non-biogenic emissions from the combustion of biogas produced on site.
(***)  The figures for 2018 and 2019 have been restated to include AdF and to align the figures with the items in the Environmental Accounts.
(****)   These are the tonnes of equivalent CO corresponding to the emissions of insulating SF present in Areti’s HV equipment (1 t of SF equates to 23,500 t 
2 6 6
of CO, GHG Protocol-5th Assessment Report – AR5).
2
(*****)  In 2019 and 2020, the replenishment of HCFC fluids in the Group’s plants was so small that it did not lead to significant CO emissions.
2
(******)  Considering the entire Group, the total Scope 1 emissions for the three-year period are as follows: 379,859 t, 357,710 t and 412,035 t.
(*******)   The indirect emissions (Scope 2) include all the Companies within the NFD scope. The figures for 2018 and 2019 have been restated for the inclusion 
of AdF. As an emission factor per unit of electricity consumed (t CO/MWh), for the location-based calculation the value of 0.336 was used for 2020 
2
(0.36 for the previous two-year period), as per Terna’s “International Comparisons” document (2019 data). For the calculation of Scope 2 emissions 
using the market-based method, the residual mix coefficients are the following for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively: 0.476 t/MWh, 0.487 t/MWh and 
0.466 (Source: AIB document “European Residual Mixes 2019”). Also including the Companies Umbra Acque, AdF, Publiacqua and Acque (outside the 
NFD scope), for the sole proprietary share quota of Acea, for the three-year period 2018-2020, location-based CO emissions are equal to 403,772 t, 
2
419,578 t and 392,575 t respectively, whereas for the market-based emissions they are equal to 291,041 t, 316,749 t and 309,117 t.
(********)   This value, estimated, refers to suppliers of goods, services and works. The 2020 figure is broken down as follows: 9,713 tonnes of CO2 for suppliers of 
services and works and 1,928.7 tonnes of CO2 for suppliers of goods. The decrease compared to the previous two-year period is attributable to the different 
composition of the panel of suppliers included for the calculation, and to restrictions and stoppages due to the pandemic.
(*********)   Scope 1 emissions included in this index are those from power generation plants. The increase in 2020 is attributable to waste-to-energy processing, due 
to a drop in the biodegradable fraction of waste at both the San Vittore del Lazio and Terni plants.
NOTE   Emission factors for Scope 1 emissions are taken from the standard parameters – ISPRA data 2019, DEFRA 2020 and GHG Protocol-5th Assessment 
Report-AR5.

representation of genders, as set out in Law no. 120/2011, adopted in its own 
By-laws, as well as guaranteeing the presence of Independent Directors, 
governed by the same By-laws and current regulations. Gender diversity 
of the Governance Body and the Committees is an important element, in 
tempering “single-mindedness” as well as for the different ways in which men 
and women exercise their leadership.
Selection processes involve shareholders who, in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Governance Code, are guided in the choice of 
candidates to propose in the lists by the guidelines provided by the Board 
of Directors of Acea, having received the opinion of the Appointments 
Committee and taking into account the results of self-assessment, on the

conflicts of interest could arise: in relations between controlling shareholders

and senior executives’ objectives for economic, environmental, and social 
topics.
It is noted that within Acea, for the Top Management, Executives Holding 
Key Positions and for managerial roles with greater impact on Group 
business, the clawback clause applies, establishing the right to request 
return of the variable components of remuneration, both short-term and 
medium/long-term, in the event that these components have been paid on 
the basis of conduct of a malicious nature and/or due to serious misconduct. 
There are no agreements that set out fixed indemnities or clauses aimed 
at safeguarding the management of the Group in the event of termination 
of their employment, and reference should be made to the provisions 
established by the Collective Labour Agreement (CCNL) for Executives 
of Public Utility Service Companies in this regard. The LTIP – Long Term 
Incentive Plan currently in force, is linked solely to targets of an economic/
financial nature. The parameters of the new plan have already been evaluated, 
which will begin in 2021, with inclusion of a composite sustainability goal. The 
short-term annual (MBO) incentive system is linked, as well as to targets of 
an economic/financial nature, also to environmental targets and those with 
an impact on sustainability, also through a composite sustainability indicator.

SCOPE
The scope of the Environmental Accounts  is consistent with the reporting perimeter of the Sustainability Report  (Consolidated Non-Financial Disclo-
sure  pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016), as defined in the Methodological Note. 
The water Companies in which Acea has an investment: Acque, AdF, Publiacqua and Umbra Acque – consolidated in the Financial Statements 
with the equity method – are marginally included in the Environmental Accounts and only relative to the aspects which are specifically signalled 
in the text. Please see the chapter Water Company data sheets and overseas activities (outside the perimeter of the Consolidated Non-Financial 
Disclosure). In 2020 Companies Acque Industriali and AdF were included in the NFD perimeter. In this regard, the data for the three-year 
period have been updated. 
The Environmental Accounts, integral part of the Sustainability Re- terms of producing and distributing energy, collecting and dis-

1 Gross total energy produced by Acea Ambiente and Acea Produzione. The figure is calculated.
2 Electricity produced net of the losses due to just the Produzione phase. The figure is calculated.
Total electricity produced, inclusive of the losses, by the Acea Produzione power plants. IncEudes thermoelectric and 
3 = 4 + 5
hydro- electric energy. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of less than ± 0.5%.
Losses of electricity attributable to just the production phase of the Acea Produzione power plants. Includes: the self-
6 = 7 + 8 + 9 consumption (thermal and hydro) and the losses of initial transformation. The figure is measured with an uncertainty 
of less than ± 0.5%.
10 Electricity produced by the Acea Produzione power plants net of the losses. The figure is calculated.
Gross energy produced by photovoltaic installations. The FV of Parco della Mistica is not reported because it is outside the 
11 scope. The data includes energy produced by the plants in Orvieto (Acea Ambiente), in Acea Ato 2 and by the plants acquired 
starting from 2019 and attributable to Acea Sun Capital. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of less than ± 0.5%.
Total losses during photovoltaic generating phase, due in particular to joule effect (dissipation during heating) in the 
12
equipment. Estimated figure.
13 Net photovoltaic electricity made available by the generating installations. The figure is calculated.
Electricity produced by the Waste-to-Energy installations: waste-to-energy of San Vittore del Lazio and waste-to-
energy of Terni of Acea Ambiente. We wish to specify that the fuel used in the two installations (SRF – solid recovered 
fuel – for San Vittore del Lazio and paper mill pulp for the Terni plant) is composed of both biodegradable organic 
14 = 15 + 16 material, neutral on the balance of the CO, and by non-biodegradable organic substance (plastic, resins, etc.). In 2020, 
2
the renewable share for the San Vittore del Lazio plant was equal to 42.5%, the Terni incinerator share to 42.4%. With 
regard to the energy produced at San Vittore del Lazio and Terni, problems on the turbine of line 3 of the first plant and on 
the turbine of the second plant affected the quantities of electricity produced which, for this reason was less than in 2019. 
Self-consumption of the two waste-to-energy plants of San Vittore del Lazio and Terni + initial transformation losses. 
17
The figure is measured with an uncertainty of less than ± 0.5%.
Electricity produced by the two waste-to-energy plants of San Vittore del Lazio and Terni, net of the self-consumption 
18
and initial transformation losses. The figure is calculated.
Electricity produced from biogas by the waste management plant in Orvieto and, from 2020, the two composting 
19
plants of Aprilia and Monterotondo Marittimo (Acea Ambiente). The figure is calculated.
Self-consumption of biogas production plants, including small dissipations. The figure is measured with an uncertainty 
20
of less than ± 5%.
Net electricity produced from biogas and transferred to the network. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of 
21
less than ± 5%. 
Thermal energy produced in the cogeneration plant of Tor di Valle including losses. The figure is measured with an 
22
uncertainty of ± 2%, near the delivery piping of the generators. 
Losses of thermal energy of the district heating systems, due to: thermal dissipation, losses on the network, technical 
23 releases for maintenance operations, thermal reintegrations of the heat accumulation systems. The figure is calculated 
as the difference between the thermal energy produced and that actually supplied to the clients (invoiced).
24 Net thermal energy supplied to final clients. The figure, calculated, is obtained from the consumption invoiced. 
Electricity supplied to Acea Produzione to Acea Energia with inter-Group exchange. The figure is marginal as a result of the 
25
choice made by the Acea Group to sell the electricity produced in Borsa (Stock Exchange) or through bilateral agreements. 
Electricity supplied by the Single Purchaser and Market, including the amount imported subject to recalculation in 
26
relation to the ARERA DCO 492/2019/R/eel. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 0.5%. 
Energy requested on the electrical distribution network of Rome and Formello by all the client connected (open 
27
market + managed service). The figure is estimated.
Losses of electricity that occur during the distribution and transmission phase. They are attributable to: losses of 
28
transformation and transport, fraud and incorrect measurements. The figure is estimated.
29 Personal use of electricity for the implementation of the distribution activities. The figure is estimated.
Electricity transferred to third parties. This is electricity sold to distribution companies. The increase is a consequence of two 
30
new closed distribution systems powered by Areti from July 2019. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 0.5%. 
Total net electricity conveyed to final clients of the open market connected to the electrical distribution network of 
31 Rome and Formello. Includes both the quota of electricity sold by Acea Energia, and that sold by other operators 
active on the open market. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 5% according to Standard CEI 13-4.
Net electricity transferred to managed final clients. 
The decrease is the result of the progressive passage of managed service clients to the open market. In other words, 
32
it is a direct consequence of the deregulation process of the electricity market in effect in Italy since 1999 (Italian 
Legislative Decree no. 79/99). The figure is estimated based on the consumption invoiced.
33 Net electricity sold by Acea on the open market nationally. The figure is estimated. 
34 Net electricity sold by Acea nationally on the open market and the standard service. The figure is calculated.

Total incoming waste. They are the quantities arriving at the Orvieto plant which include: unsorted municipal solid waste, 
38
organic fraction, green, non-hazardous industrial waste. The figure is calculated.
Waste partly sent for shredding only, partly just for aerobic treatment, partly both to the anaerobic digester and the 
39
aerobic treatment. The figure is calculated.
40 Waste disposed directly in landfill. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 1%.
41 Waste disposed of in landfill after treatment. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 1%. 
42 Waste recovered and not sent to landfill. It is glass, paper and cardboard, iron and plastic. The figure is calculated.
Compost produced at the Orvieto plant. Thanks to the combination of the anaerobic and aerobic processes, the product 
43
is Quality Compost. The figure is measured with an uncertainty of ± 1%.
Reduction due to stabilization. This represents the loss of mass due to the natural transformations of the material and the

coefficients (MATTM 2019).
Quantity of equivalent CO estimated on the basis of refrigerant fluid replenishments (HCFCs), considering that 1 
2
t of gas has a heating capacity of about 1,300-2,500 times that of CO. The value depends on the specific type of 
2
gas (source: GHG Protocol – IPCC Fifth Assessment Report; for gas mixtures the factor is calculated on the primary 
249
source). Half of the emissions are allocated to the energy segment and half to the water segment, as is the case for 
the quantities of refrigerant fluids (HCFCs). The figure coincides with item no. 249. For 2019 and 2020 the figure is 
less than one inasmuch as replenishments were not significant.

Independent auditor’s report on the consolidated non-
financial statement 
pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree No. 254/2016 and article 5 of 
CONSOB Regulation No. 20267 of January 2018 
 
 
 
To the Board of Directors of Acea SpA 
 
 
Pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree No. 254 of 30 December 2016 (the 
“Decree”) and article 5 of CONSOB Regulation No. 20267/2018, we have performed a limited 
assurance engagement on the “2020 Sustainability Report – (Consolidated Non-Financial 
Statement pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 254/2016, prepared according to the GRI 
Standard)” of Acea SpA and its subsidiaries (hereafter the “Group”) for the year ended 31 
December 2020 prepared in accordance with article 4 of the Decree and approved by the Board of 
Directors on 10 March 2021 (hereafter the “NFS”). 
 
 
Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the NFS 
   
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with article 3 and 4 of 
the Decree and with the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards” defined 
in 2016, and updated to 2018, by the GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the “GRI Standards”), 
indicated at paragraph “Disclosing Sustainability: Methodological Note” of the NFS identified by 
them as the reporting standards. 
 
The Directors are also responsible, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a NFS that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
Moreover, the Directors are responsible for identifying the content of the NFS, within the matters 
mentioned in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, considering the activities and characteristics of 
the Group and to the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Group’s activities, its 
performance, its results and related impacts.  
 
Finally, the Directors are responsible for defining the business and organisational model of the 
Group and, with reference to the matters identified and reported in the NFS, for the policies 
adopted by the Group and for the identification and management of risks generated or faced by 
the Group. 
 
The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, 
compliance with the Decree. 
   
 
OPINION LETTER OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 281
 
Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control 
 
We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, 
competence and professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm 
adopts International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains an 
overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with 
ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
 
We are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the 
compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our work in 
accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000 
Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for 
limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in 
order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures 
performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a 
reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not 
provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts 
and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. 
 
The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted 
in interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information 
presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to 
obtain evidence considered useful. 
 
In particular, we performed the following procedures: 
1.  analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and 
characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process 
used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standards adopted; 
2.  analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to 
assess their compliance with the Decree; 
3.  comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with that reported in the 
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements; 
4.  understanding of the following matters: 
−  business and organisational model of the Group with reference to the management of 
the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree; 
−  policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of 
the Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators; 
−  key risks generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters 
specified in article 3 of the Decree. 
With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the 
information presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 
a) below;   
2 of 3 
282 ACEA GROUP / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020
 
5.  understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of 
the significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In detail, we 
held meetings and interviews with the management of Acea SpA and with the personnel 
of Acea Produzione SpA and Acea ATO 2 SpA and we performed limited analyses of 
documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures for the 
collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information to 
the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS. 
 
Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the 
Group: 
-  at a group level: 
a)  with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in 
particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we 
carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify its 
consistency with available evidence; 
b)  with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical 
procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the 
accuracy of consolidation of the information; 
-  for the companies Acea SpA, Acea Produzione SpA, Acea ATO 2 SpA and for the 
thermoelectric plant of Tor di Valle (Acea Produzione SpA) which were selected 
on the basis of their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at 
a consolidated level and their location, we carried out meetings and interviews 
during which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation 
regarding the correct application of the procedures and calculation methods used 
for the key performance indicators. 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
NFS of Acea Group for the year ended 31 December 2020 is not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.
