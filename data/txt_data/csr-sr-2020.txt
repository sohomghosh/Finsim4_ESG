depends on the achievement of individual targets agreed in advance as part of the group’s sustainability strategy, including our climate policy.
• The non-recurrent results-based bonus KBC pays its employees in Belgium has been partially linked to sustainability targets since 2012. In 2020,  
the targets were linked partly to our direct footprint – reducing paper consumption – but also to employee development (training days,  
digitality and progress management) and to cybersecurity (phishing tests).

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
Our commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals
The UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) set the global agenda 
for governments, businesses and 
civil society on addressing the major 
sustainable development challenges, 
such as how to end poverty, protect the 
planet and ensure prosperity for all. As 
a financial institution, we have a critical 
role to play in tackling these goals. While 
the 17 SDGs are all interconnected and 
relevant, and we ensure through our 
sustainability policy that we work on 
all of them, we have chosen to focus in 
greater depth on five goals where we 
believe KBC can have the biggest impact 
and make the largest contribution. These 
goals are most clearly connected to our 
business and sustainability strategy. 
As we are clearly entering the decade 
of action as determined by the UN 
Secretary General, our group remains 
committed to its role in the unstoppable 
movement pushing for the required 
transformation.

10 Figures exclude UBB in Bulgaria.
11 Includes data for Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland and Slovakia (newly built dwellings with energy label A and B awaiting final decision on the EU taxonomy criteria).
12 Data differ from the data reported in previous sustainability reports due to difference in reporting period (end-of-year data in this report).
13 From 2020 onwards our Equator Principles reporting also include large real estate development and real estate re-development projects, however, limited to projects with investment costs exceeding 30 million euros.
14 The 2018 figures were restated in the final version of the BRS vzw Annual Report. The figures in the KBC Group Sustainability Report have been corrected accordingly.
15 The decrease in the number of suppliers that signed the Code of Conduct for suppliers between 2018 and 2019 is due to the raising of the threshold (over 25 000 euros spend, up from over 12 500 euros spend the previous year), resulting in a 
smaller share of suppliers that signed the Code of Conduct.

SUSTAINABILITY FACTS AND FIGURES
1 FTE and headcount figures include flexible DPP and DPC contracts (temporary contracts primarily for students) in the Czech Republic and Slovakia while no other people indicators take account of the flexible DPP and DPC contracts.
2 Basic people data alone has been gathered for some small entities (together representing less than 60 FTEs) located outside the core countries and which are not corporate branches of KBC Bank NV. These entities have not therefore been included 
in the people indicators (except for headcount, FTE, gender and employee categories).
3 FTE and headcount figures differ from the figures reported in the 2020 KBC Group Annual Report and on p.15 of this report due to a difference in reporting period. See the ‘About this report’ section of this report. Consequently, the recently 
acquired OTP Banka Slovensko (630 FTEs) is also not included in the figures in the table above.
4 Employee turnover: total leavers (excluding internal mobility) divided by total population at the end of the reporting period (headcount)
5 Internal mobility: internal mobility divided by the total population at the end of the reporting period (headcount)
6 Lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) = the number of fatalities as a result of work-related injury/number of hours worked x 1 000 000
7 The 2018 and 2019 figures are restated in the KBC Group Sustainability Report 2020 to include some smaller group entities, which were not in the scope of previous reports.
8 This excludes KBC University training programmes completed by top management and top talents as these are reported separately.
9 Learning and development data only includes trainings for which a formal registration in the local learning management system exists. On-the-job learning and knowledge sharing amongst employees is often not formally registered while – based 
on relevant literature – it is assumed that employees spend up to one third of their working hours on informal learning activities. Formally registered trainings thus only concern a small part of total learning activities and it is fair to assume that the 
actual time spent on learning and development is much higher than the figure reported in the table above. 
10 The decrease in total time spent on KBC University training programmes and events between 2018 and 2019 reflects the fact that the majority of top managers had completed the KBC University training programme in 2018. The focus going 
forward will be on current and top-of mind topics such as cyber security, responsible behaviour, big data and artificial intelligence. 
11 Although the Group Employee Survey is usually executed every two years, we focused on short, action-oriented interviews in 2019, which was an important transitional year with numerous changes. Because of this, the group-wide engagement 
survey – in the same format across all countries – was postponed to 2020.
12 Excluding KBC’s own shared service centres in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, which are reported separately.

1 As the reporting period is from 1 October of the previous year until 30 September of the current year, the 2020 data only partly includes the impact of Covid-19 on our direct footprint, i.e. two quarters impacted by Covid-19.
2 FTEs covered differ from the FTE figures reported under people indicators as the system boundaries for GHG emissions were determined by operational control and aligned with the financial consolidation scope of the KBC Group. Some entities 
have not therefore been included in the environmental data while they are included in employee information. Please note that data is for the reporting period 1 October 2019 – 30 September 2020 and thus exclude the recently acquired OTP 
Banka Slovensko.
3 Total energy consumption differs from the sum of the different energy sources, as the consumption of self-generated electricity from non-renewable fuel has been excluded to avoid double counting and counted under fuel consumption.
4 The GHG inventory was prepared according to the requirements of the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas protocol. The system boundaries for GHG emissions were determined by operational control and aligned with the financial consolidation scope 
of the KBC Group. The greenhouse gases included were: CO , N O, CH  and refrigerant gases.
2 2 4
5 The total GHG emissions figure reported here has been calculated using the market-based calculation method described in the GHG Protocol, Scope 2 Guidance. This calculation method takes account of low-carbon electricity use (from renewable 
and nuclear sources) at a low-carbon emission factor (0g CO e/GJ). Using the location-based calculation method described in the GHG Protocol, our Scope 2 GHG emissions amounted to 42 844.88 tonnes CO e in 2020, 50 556.62 tonnes CO e in 
2 2 2
2019 and 52 878.56 tonnes CO e in 2018.
2
6 The data and information for the GHG inventory were mainly historical in nature. Extrapolations were performed for missing data. Because not all entities can deliver all required emission source data and entities in countries that have less than 
100 FTEs are out of scope of the non-financial environmental data-gathering, we have extrapolated based on historical per-FTE activity data and per-FTE CO e emissions respectively, so as to reflect our total GHG emissions. The GHG emissions 
2
calculated by extrapolation account for 4.66% of total GHG emissions in 2020. Hypothetical approaches were only used for limited activities
7 KBC Group’s GHG emissions have been externally verified in accordance with ISO 14064-3. Vinçotte has verified KBC Group’s GHG assertion of 55 850.25 of CO e to a level of reasonable assurance and concluded that KBC Group’s reported GHG 
2
emissions for 2020 are reliable and fairly stated. View the verification statement here.
8 Scope 1 emissions comprise emissions from fuel combustion, emissions from refrigerant gases and emissions from business travel and commuter travel by our company car fleet
9 Scope 2 emissions comprise emissions from our use of electricity and district heating, cooling and steam consumption
10 Scope 3 emissions comprise emissions from business travel and commuter travel (except emissions from our company car fleet which are included in Scope 1 emissions), emissions from paper and water consumption and emissions from waste 
generation
11 We have set 2015 as our base year, as reliable data has been available since that year for the whole group

GRI/SASB index
This sustainability report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  
Standards: ‘Core’ option and has not been externally audited. Since 2019, we are mapping our material 
topics to relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards within the Financials 
Industry Standards.
The content index includes reporting on the relevant disclosure topics and associated metrics under the 
‘Commercial Banks’ industry standard only (primary industry as defined in the SASB’s Sustainable Industry 
Classification System (SICS)). Given that we have activities in multiple industries and not only primary 
industry commercial banks, we will continue to evaluate the standards in the future in order to report on 
other industry standards as well. Please note that we do not currently disclose all metrics included in the 
standards.
The GRI/SASB content index is set out below. Reference is made to our annual report 2020 (AR 2020), our 
Sustainability Report 2020 (SR 2020), the KBC Group Sustainability Framework and our corporate website.
Complementarity of the GRI and SASB standards
The GRI and SASB standards meet the needs of different audiences. The SASB standards focus on 
identifying and communicating material sustainability factors likely to impact financial performance to 
investors whereas GRI standards are designed to provide information on a very broad array of topics to a 
wide variety of stakeholders, including suppliers, clients, communities and interest groups. In this respect, we 
greatly welcome the commitment of five framework and standard-setting institutions – CDP, CDSB, GRI, IIRS 
and SASB – to work towards a comprehensive corporate reporting system.

APPENDIX: PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE BANKING
KBC was the first endorser and signatory in the Belgian market of the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRBs) launched in September 2019. The Principles clearly reflect the 
key elements of our vision on sustainability and reinforce our commitment to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
KBC and more than 30 other banks have also gone a step further with the Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA). You can read more about this specific commitment 
in the ‘Our commitment to the climate’ part of the ‘Sustainable finance’ section of this report. We have adopted the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative 
(UNEP FI) reporting and self-assessment template to communicate on our progress on the PRBs. Assurance of alignment to the PRBs is not yet mandatory and not available at 
this point in time.

Principle 1. Alignment
We will align our business strategy to be consistent with and contribute to individuals’ needs and society’s goals, as expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Agreement and relevant 
national and regional frameworks.
1.1 Describe (high-level) your bank’s business model, including the main customer segments  KBC is an integrated bank-insurance group (banking, insurance and asset management), active in  KBC Group Sustainability Report 2020:

operations or provides products and services. markets. We offer a wide range of loan, deposit, asset management, insurance and other financial 
products in virtually all our countries, where our focus is on private individuals, SMEs (small and 
medium-sized enterprises) and high-net-worth clients. Services for corporate clients additionally 
include cash management, payments, trade finance, lease, money market activities, capital market 
products, stockbroking and corporate finance. 64% of our total loan portfolio is allocated to our 
customers in the Belgium Business Unit, 17.6% in the Czech Republic Business Unit and 18.4% in our 
other core countries. Our corporate lending portfolio constitutes 46.1% and private lending portfolio 
43% of our total loan portfolio. 
The main sectors in our corporate lending portfolio (as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio) 
are (1) services 10.8%, (2) distribution 6.9%, (3) real estate 6.3%, (4) building and construction 3.9%, 
(5) agriculture, fishing, farming 2.7%, (6) automotive 2.5%, (7) food production and beverages (food 
producers 1.8% and beverages 0.4%), (8) energy (1.6% electricity and 0.5% oil, gas & other fuels), (9) 
metals 1.4% and (10) chemicals 1.4%. 93% of our lending to private individuals consists of mortgages 
which provide many households in our core markets with the opportunity to buy their own property.

APPENDIX: PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE BANKING
1.2 Describe how your bank has aligned and/or is planning to align its strategy to be consistent  We have translated our sustainability strategy into three cornerstones: limiting our adverse impact 
with and contribute to society’s goals, as expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals  on society, increasing our positive impact on society (focus on environmental responsibility, 
(SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and relevant national and regional frameworks. entrepreneurship, financial literacy and health/longevity) and encouraging responsible behaviour 
among our employees. Our strategy is aligned with the SDGs.
We support the Paris Agreement and signed the CCCA. Our Sustainable Finance Programme has 
been set up as part of our sustainability strategy. 
Given the EU’s focus on its climate ambitions via the EU Green Deal, we firmly believe that KBC’s 
priority across our core countries is climate change, including climate adaption and climate 
mitigation. In a first phase, we analysed our loan portfolio while drawing up white papers on how to 
align our strategy with the EU’s ambitions. Colleagues from our credit, business and other relevant 
departments in all our core markets were involved in the preparation of the white papers to take 
account of differences in the national situation or government policies.

We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and the environment resulting from our activities, products and services. To this end, 
we will set and publish targets for those areas in which we can have the most significant impact.

APPENDIX: PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE BANKING
(1) Our total energy sector exposure is 2.1% of our total outstanding loan portfolio at year-end 2020. To assess 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of our energy portfolio on climate change, we first took a look at our 
activities in the energy sector and their share of this portfolio per core country: (1) renewable energy and 
biofuels, (2) oil and gas, (3) nuclear and (4) coal. Regarding the positive impact associated with our energy 
portfolio, we have identified business opportunities relating to renewable energy and we are supporting 
our clients in their transition. 61% of our energy credit portfolio consists of renewable energy loans. At 
the end of 2020, our portfolio of renewable energy project finance stood at 1.1 billion euros (outstanding 
amount), which resulted in avoided emissions of 448 351 tonnes CO . 
2
(2) The commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio represents 6.3% of our total outstanding loan portfolio. To 
measure the energy efficiency of the CRE buildings that we finance, we have asked our core countries 
to collect relevant data. Some have already presented an initial stock-take of the potential green share 
of their existing portfolios based mainly on external quality standard labels (BREAAM, LEED, etc.) that 
take account of the greenness of the assets financed. We will continue to take action and collect data to 
measure, manage and steer the climate-related risks and opportunities of our CRE portfolio. 
(3) Our total agriculture sector exposure is 2.7% of our total outstanding loan portfolio at year-end 2020. 
Besides CO , the GHG emissions related to this sector include methane and nitrous oxide. We have not 
2
yet gathered data to determine the climate impact of our agriculture portfolio and plan to perform further 
analysis and data collection on this sector in 2021. 
(4) Mortgage loans are a core product for KBC in all our core countries and represent 39.7% of our total 
outstanding loan portfolio. We have not yet gathered data on the energy performance of all the buildings 
financed and of the collateral. This will be needed to measure impact, set targets and determine the GHG 
emissions associated with our mortgage loans. We have however made some calculations based on a 
preliminary data set using the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) methodology on which 
you can find more information in the ‘PCAF’ appendix of this report.
(5) KBC is also active in operational leasing and has set ambitious targets to decrease the emissions of 
the cars in our car leasing fleets and to increase the share of electric and hybrid vehicles. We have set 
clear targets to decrease the GHG emissions of the cars, have increased the share of electric and hybrid 
vehicles and offer bicycle leasing. CO  emissions avoided through the latter solutions is 6 555 tonnes/year 
2
(representing 60 117 634 kilometres/year). In this case too, we have made some calculations based on a 
preliminary data set using the PCAF methodology, on which you can find more information in the ‘PCAF’  
appendix of this report
Please provide your bank’s conclusion/statement as to whether it has fulfilled the requirements regarding Impact Analysis
We have identified significant impacts of climate change – both climate adaptation and climate mitigation – on our lending portfolio (climate-sensitive sectors and product lines). As a next step, we will continue our strategic exercise and work on other 
climate-sensitive sectors and will broaden the scope of our exercise to include our insurance business.

employees should go beyond regulation and compliance. As responsible behaviour is hard to define, 
we have decided not to draw up precise guidelines for it, but to set out the underlying principles in 
‘My Responsible Behaviour Compass’. The KBC University provides our management with dilemma 
training so that they can share and discuss dilemmas with their staff. In Belgium, we launched an 
online training course in 2020 to raise awareness of responsible behaviour. The training achieved a 
very high participation rate (> 85 %) and attracted a 4.5 out of 5 quality rating based on feedback from 
more than 3 000 participants. It will be rolled out in the other core countries in 2021.

framework with its guiding principles on a regular base. The team pays particular attention to ensure 
that all sustainability proposals in the organisation adequately reflect the principles of the PRBs and 
we are often consulted by colleagues across the organisation seeking guidance on important societal 
topics and potential dilemmas. 
We have established a governance structure within our group that guarantees attention is paid 
to sustainability by the highest decision-making bodies while being broadly integrated into our 
operations. Our Executive Committee is the highest level with direct responsibility for sustainability 
and climate change (our impact areas climate adaptation and climate mitigation) and ratifies the 
decisions taken by our Internal Sustainability Board and the Sustainable Finance Steering Committee 
in the area of sustainability and climate-change issues. 
Progress on our Sustainable Finance Programme (including our impact on climate change) is reported 
to our Sustainable Finance Steering Committee and to our Executive Committee and Board of 
Directors through a status report at least once a year. Our Sustainable Finance Programme Core 
Team has integrated climate change within the group and oversees and supports our business 
departments. Programme members meet every week to ensure swift action on the programme’s 
objectives, including climate change.

APPENDIX: PRINCIPLES FOR SUSTAINABLE INSURANCE 
In 2018, KBC Insurance became a signatory to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSIs), which serve as the global framework for insurance companies to better manage 
environmental, social and governance risks (ESG), as well as opportunities in their core business strategies and operations. As a PSI signatory, KBC Insurance reports on 
its progress in embedding the PSIs in all aspects of its operations. This reporting and self-assessment template outlines the activities KBC Insurance has undertaken to 
demonstrate its commitment to the PSIs.  
Reporting and self-assessment template High-level summary of KBC’s response References and more information
Principle 1

relevant to our insurance business. responsibility for society and local economies seriously.  p. 23-24, p. 40-42, p. 43-68
Our sustainability policies and restrictions are also fully applicable for insurance underwriting. Insurance underwriting and investments are also fully 
covered by our sustainability governance. The Internal Sustainability Board, chaired by the Group CEO, hence also decides on all insurance-related 
sustainability topics.  Our Sustainable Finance Program also covers the insurance business.
As indicated throughout this report, the focus of our sustainable activities today is very much on climate change mitigation, but also on climate change 
adaptation. Without ignoring other important societal issues, climate action is a top priority for KBC Insurance too.
KBC Insurance already covers environmental and climate-related physical risks in most of its insurance solutions.  E.g., flood cover is available as a 
standard cover for residential property (except for buildings in known flood-prone areas). 
At KBC Insurance in Belgium, moreover, the standard home insurance policy covers all forms of renewable energy, such as solar panels, heat pumps 
and charging points. In the event of severe damage, the additional costs of rebuilding in accordance with the most recent building regulations are also 
covered. For similar damage in the case of commercial buildings, limited cover for these additional construction costs is offered with no increase of the 
premium rate.
In 2021, KBC Insurance will further elaborate on its policies and on client engagement in the field of sustainability, as part of the Sustainable Finance 
Programme. In its property underwriting, KBC Insurance:
-  Will still actively take into account flood risk. 
-  Will also work on data collection with respect to energy performance of residential and non-residential real estate.
-  Intends to include energy performance as an additional measure for the quality of a property risk.
Lastly, KBC Insurance has also included more ESG-linked criteria in its investment policy.

management.
KBC Insurance in Belgium has already launched a pilot project to unburden clients in the agricultural 
business, by removing asbestos roofs and installing solar panels on the new roofs.
KBC Insurance will further elaborate its client engagement (both internal and external) in the years to 
come, working together in the already ongoing initiatives of KBC Bank.

materiality assessment dates from 2020.
Initiatives on the part of the EU, government and/or national regulators are also addressed in 
cooperation with the local insurance associations. 
Beginning in 2020, for instance, KBC Insurance offers multi-peril climate insurance for farmers in 
Flanders as the Flemish Regional Government is phasing out the existing calamity fund.

of this methodology (see blue boxes in Figure 1). Based on reference climate scenarios provided by the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) and taking into account the current and planned capacity of the underlying 
companies being financed, PACTA helps determine whether these companies are following a transition path 
in line with targets set by the climate scenarios. In this way, the analysis helps to assess whether corporate 
loan portfolios in these sectors are aligned with Paris Agreement goals to hold the global temperature 
increase at (well) below 2 degrees. Since the activities falling within the scope of PACTA belong to some 
of the sectors for which white papers have been prepared3 (see the ‘White papers’ part of the ‘Sustainable

and those seen in the broader industry. The aforementioned physical asset-level data has been mapped to

The results for last year are not included in this year’s report as comparison would be difficult due to a 
combination of factors. These include a further refinement of the company-matching process compared to 
last year’s pilot test and the absence of certain physical assets in the updated dataset compared to the one 
used during the previous pilot test (see further in the ‘Sector results’ part of this appendix). It is important 
to highlight that these dynamics in and restatement of results may remain for years to come, as KBC is in 
a continuous process of learning while keeping track of the changing methodological landscape. Over 
time, climate-related reporting will reach a more developed and stable phase as risk and other toolkits and 
methodologies expand and improve.
2) Production volume trajectories
This metric is available for the power, fossil fuels and automotive sectors and measures the alignment of 
a portfolio’s projected change in production volumes against those given in climate scenarios. The loan-
weighted projected production volumes of individual companies per technology at a five-year forward-
looking horizon in the portfolio have been aggregated to calculate the charts in the figures on the 
following pages. The resulting volume trajectories are thus compared with the trends set as targets in the 
aforementioned climate scenarios.
