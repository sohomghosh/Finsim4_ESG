Management’s Roundtable Discussion
James: New products, especially our innovative equipment revolver.  
And a move towards larger accounts. We also had greater penetration  
of the Ontario market, where we’ve focused our efforts on our more unique 
products, and on developing relationships with the more sophisticated  
referral sources. The overall economic backdrop helped too, in particular 
the improving economy in Western Canada. With oil generally holding 
above US$50 a barrel, we’re seeing stability in the oil patch, which in turn 
drives economic growth in many supporting industries and public  
infrastructure, all of which we finance.
Ken Hitzig
Ken: Given the dynamic environment in your segment, I get the feeling you’re not 
finished building.
James: We’re just hitting our stride. All of our products are performing well, 
which means we can help companies from coast to coast with equipment 
financing from $5,000 to $10 million. 2018 will be our fifth year under the 
Accord umbrella; we intend to make it our best. 
Ken: Jim, receivables management is a mature business. How are you adapting? 
Jim: We used to offer a mix of services for our clients, so that some paid us 
only for credit protection, while others paid a premium for full-service, 
which includes collections as well. In recent years we’ve focused our business 
on the full service clients. This is where we distinguish ourselves – our service  Tom Henderson
is second to none.
Ken: Why the shift away from credit protection? Isn’t that the core expertise?
Jim: We’re not downplaying our credit skills; we’re simply adding value 
where our competitors can’t. And the “credit only” clients switch suppliers 
frequently based on price, while our full service clients tend to stay with  
us for the long term. So we’re happier and so are they. 
Ken: So is the business profitable? 
Jim: As we focused our efforts on a smaller list of high-value clients, we also 
reduced our overhead towards the end of 2016. So our expenses in 2017 
were significantly lower than previous years. While our top line held steady,  Stuart Adair
our bottom line was nicely positive. 
Ken: Terry, how did the Company fare south of the border? 
Terry: As Tom said, all of our hard work finally bore fruit. The portfolio 
grew nicely from about US$44 million to US$63 million, much of that growth 
coming in the second half. So I like our momentum. 
Ken: But looking at the financials, the bottom line didn’t reflect the top line growth.
Terry: Our profit took a hit. As Tom mentions in his President’s letter, we lost 
money on a loan to a lender (our first loss in seven years). We also incurred 
some expenses in closing our small-ticket factoring division in suburban 
Chicago. Without those expenses we would have been quite happy with the  Simon Hitzig
results. Thankfully the expenses are behind us while the portfolio carries 
into 2018. 
Ken: Besides the healthy portfolio growth, any silver lining? 
Terry: Absolutely – we learned a lot. In fact we learned that if we want to 
succeed in a new market segment, it’s better to invest in an outstanding 
company with a strong operating history, than start something on our own. 
And that’s what we did – we joined forces with BondIt and CapX Partners.  
Those businesses are performing nicely. 
Ken: Tom, you mentioned one of the keys to success is Accord’s expanded product 
line in recent years. How is that an advantage?
Fred Moss
Tom: Having more products in our arsenal makes us more valuable to referral 
sources. It also makes us more valuable to our borrowing clients, as we can

Management’s Roundtable Discussion
provide seamless solutions for multiple financing challenges. And our clients 
can grow with us, graduating from small loans to larger, more comprehensive 
solutions. 
James: Our flexible balance sheet is a tremendous advantage. Many of our 
competitors “securitize” their portfolios, which means they sell their leases 
to funders, often large insurance companies. These funders want all deals to 
look the same, which means our competitors have less flexibility to develop 
market-responsive solutions. We don’t have that problem.
Terry Keating Ken: How does this translate into innovative products?
James: We can tailor products to what our customers really need. For example, 
we’ve launched several new products in recent years, including an unsecured 
small loan product and our unique equipment-backed revolver. 
Ken: Have these products been embraced by the market?
James: The equipment revolver went from a standing start in the first 
quarter to nearly a quarter of our portfolio by year-end. And this happened 
while our overall portfolio grew by nearly 40%. So I’d say the market gave us 
a seal of approval. 
Ken: Fred, can you provide some color on key initiatives in 2017?
Jim Bates
Fred: Our business unit already offers a broad range of asset-based lending 
programs, with a focus on receivables and inventory, and in some cases 
equipment. So we’re more focused on tailoring our core products to specific 
industries, where our deep expertise is particularly valuable.
Ken: Can you give us a few examples?
Fred: Alternative lenders and retailers. In both cases we have an exceptional 
ability to understand their capital needs and the environment they operate 
in. During the course of 2017 we spoke to dozens of Canadian companies in 
these industries and developed some terrific relationships. And of course we 
signed some business too.
James Jang
Ken: Terry, are you taking a similar approach in the U.S.?
Terry: Yes. We also offer a flexible lender finance program, which is starting 
to find a market. Since the credit crisis, non-bank lending has seen terrific 
growth in a variety of areas, including specialty consumer and business 
lending. Lending to the successful alternative lenders allows us to participate 
in their growth. 
Ken: Do we have an edge in this area?
Terry: That’s a softball. We do – we’ve been an alternative lender for  
forty years, so we get it. Finance companies love to borrow from Accord;  
they know we understand their challenges and opportunities. 
Matthew Helderman
Ken: Some of our investors have asked if the Greenville office is also now financing 
equipment.
Terry: Only as part of an overall working capital solution. Standalone 
equipment finance takes special expertise, which is why we brought CapX 
Partners into the fold. As Tom said, combining receivables and equipment 
expertise makes us more valuable to referral sources and clients. We’re already 
seeing this translate into more referrals and funded deals for both business 
units.
Ken: Tom, you mentioned Accord’s focus on developing management depth.  
Did you make progress in 2017?
