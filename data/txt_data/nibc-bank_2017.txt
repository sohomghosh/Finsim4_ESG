LETTER FROM THE CEO
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Dear reader,
2017 was an extremely strong year for NIBC. Our culture based on our three core values,
Professional, Entrepreneurial and Inventive, is thriving and propelled by the ‘Think YES’ attitude we
are moving full steam ahead with our client-focused strategy. We have the agility to continuously re-
invent ourselves and proactively manage the relationship with a growing number of mid-market
businesses and retail clients that we serve.
Business are driving growth
On the back of healthy economic growth, we continue to harvest the benefits from the rebalancing
Paulus de Wilt,
of our businesses over the past years. Driven also by our new business lines such as Buy-to-Let,
Chief Executive
Originate-to-Manage (OTM), BEEQUIP (leasing) and Receivables Finance, which we all started as
Officer
greenfields in recent years, we have shown growth in various parts of our core markets in 2017 and Chairman of the
delivered another year of improved financial performance. In addition, the bank’s current state and Board
the way we are viewed by the market was reflected in the credit upgrades to ‘BBB’ that both S&P
and Fitch announced in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Full year 2017
Net profit of NIBC more than doubled from EUR 102 million in 2016 to EUR 210 million in 2017,
backed by the further expansion of our client franchise and including a EUR 47 million positive effect
from the sale of the German commercial real estate legacy portfolio of Vijlma. Overall Return on
Equity (ROE) reached 10.8% although we feel the ROE excluding this positive legacy effect of 8.4%
provides a better reflection of the real performance.
Saskia Hovers,
Member Executive
Net Interest Income continued to improve, strongly supported by further lowered funding costs. Committee
Income from Fees and Equity Investments was exceptionally high reflecting the strong economic
environment and quality of the portfolio. At the same time, the low interest rate environment and
abundant liquidity continue to put pressure on volumes as well as margins. As we have a strategy of
‘margin over volume’ we remain prudent and disciplined in our origination to selectively ‘pick and
choose’, as is also visible in our Corporate franchise. Despite a continued solid origination of over
EUR 3 billion, total outstanding volume decreased in 2017 as origination was more than offset by a
combination of (p)repayments, the sale of the German CRE legacy portfolio and FX effects resulting
from the strong Euro.
Reinout van Riel,
The mortgage market also experiences fierce price competition from non-banks and traditional
Chief Risk Officer
players defending market share. Margins are under pressure in all terms and consumer preference is
Member of the Board
moving to the longer fixed interest rates. Nevertheless, origination was very strong and almost
doubled to EUR 1.9 billion, thanks to the addition of our new OTM proposition. The (on-balance)
mortgage loan portfolio grew by more than 3% in 2017 to EUR 9.1 billion at year end, including a
EUR 220 million portfolio acquisition.
Costs for the company were up considerable due to extra investments in IT, regulatory projects like
the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MIFID II) and IFRS 9, the reorganisation of NIBC
Markets, and the review of the strategic options that is ongoing. Nevertheless, the cost / income ratio
for NIBC improved from 51% in 2016 to 44% in 2017 (excluding positive effect of legacy CRE sale
47%).
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 11
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Regulatory
On the regulatory front, more clarity was obtained on Basel IV; though we cannot be sure yet of the
exact translation of the new Basel Accord into local legislation, we will manage the effects and remain
solidly capitalised above our desired levels.
Although IFRS 9 will only affect us as from 2018, we are pleased to see that the effect resulting from
an amended expected loss calculation can be absorbed within the bandwidth mentioned in our H1
2017 report; more importantly we have now, as from 1 January 2018, classified all our mortgage
loans at amortised cost, which treatment is in line with market practice for mortgage loans. The
Herman Dijkhuizen,
transition to IFRS 9 results in an overall negative impact of approximately 4%-points on our CET 1
Chief Financial Officer
ratio of 19.3%.
Vice-Chairman of the
Board
Revised medium-term objectives
In 2014, we embarked on a journey to revitalise the bank and improve the profitability and resilience
of the bank by focusing firmly on our clients and on the future. Looking back at the past few years,
we are pleased to report that we achieved all of our 2015-2017 targets. We therefore announced
new medium-term objectives, which are a reflection of our improved performance and our solid
foundation for continued growth going forward.
For the coming period, we target a sustainable Return on Equity of 10-12% and a cost/income ratio
structurally below 45%, as we maintain an agile organisation with disciplined cost control. In addition,
Caroline Oosterbaan,
we aim for a CET 1 capital ratio above 14%, a dividend pay-out of at least 50% of net profit and a
Member Executive
long-term BBB+ credit rating.
Committee
Moving ahead
To sustain and further improve the performance of the bank going forward, we focus on the
following strategic priorities.
 
■ Continuous evolution of our client franchise, expertise and propositions as we anticipate
on trends and adapt our offering to the future. Not only by introducing new products but also by
partnering to leverage platforms, facilitating and investing in FinTech businesses and doing
acquisitions to either strengthen our footprint or broaden our product offering. Furthermore, we
Michel Kant, actively seek further diversification of income with non-interest income such as fees from value
Member Executive
adding services as well as income from equity investments.
Committee
■ Focus on growth of our asset portfolio in core markets through a differentiated market
approach. We focus on building long-standing client relationships in chosen and profitable niches
and sub-sectors in North-western Europe. Contrary to many banks, we do not offer routine
services such as current accounts or payment services and without the distractions and costs of
operating a large branch network, we are able to serve our clients in a focused and dynamic way.
We are not volume driven and as such have no market share target leaving room to be flexible
and to anticipate changing market conditions and be among the first movers in our sub-sectors
and profitable niches.
■ Building on our existing agile and effective organisation to drive customer satisfaction.
Helped by the ‘Think YES’ mentality of our people, we are relentlessly looking for opportunities to
better serve our clients. As a validation of the efforts on this front, our Net Promoter Score for
corporate clients increased to 64% in 2017. This score firmly underpins the growth of the
corporate client business as almost two-third of our new clients come through referrals of existing
clients. Meanwhile, the retail client satisfaction rose to 7.9, up from the already high level of 7.6 in
12 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
LETTER FROM THE CEO
the preceding year. Ongoing investment in people, culture and innovation will ensure we
remain well positioned to attract and retain the right talent, and develop our employees.
Furthermore our Innovation Lab is fostering a culture of openness to change and is making sure
we stay at the forefront of new developments.
■ Further optimising the capital structure and diversifying the funding base to ensure that
we will be around to support our clients not only today, but also tomorrow. The proactive
balancing of our funding profile over the past few years has increased the overall resilience of the
bank, as validated by the credit upgrades to BBB. To us, these new credit ratings more accurately
reflect the bank’s current state and the way we are viewed by the market. In September, strong
investor demand for our Additional Tier I (AT 1) bond showed the market’s confidence in the
strategy and performance of the bank.
At the H1 2017 results in August 2017, we announced that, backed by our current shareholder, we
commenced a review of our strategic alternatives, which may include an Initial Public Offering (IPO).
This process is ongoing and preparations are progressing well. A final decision will be made at a later
date and amongst others will be dependent upon market circumstances.
In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our employees for their tireless dedication and
enthusiasm. They are the reason why we are trusted by an increasing number of clients to support
them at the moments that matter most in business and life. I’m fully confident that we can continue
to make a difference at our clients’ most decisive moments and build profitable growth well into the
future.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank our clients, who are the driving force behind everything
we do. I look forward to working with all of you in 2018 and beyond, and I appreciate your continued
support.

VISION AND STRATEGY
About NIBC
NIBC was established in 1945 to finance the visionary entrepreneurs who helped rebuild the
Netherlands after World War II. Over time, we evolved to being an enterprising bank offering
financing, advisory, and co-investing to our clients. After we came out of the 2008 financial crisis, we
have reinvented ourselves. We have seen many milestones since, with the launch of NIBC Direct and
BEEQUIP, the acquisitions of Gallinat Bank AG in Germany and SNS Securities, now NIBC Bank
Deutschland AG and NIBC Markets, respectively, and more recently our steps into the fintech space
by acquiring minority stakes in Ebury and Finleap. Backed by our supportive and long term
shareholder we have continued to build on our entrepreneurial DNA and have become the bank
that we are today; best suited to help entrepreneurs at their decisive moments. Now and in the
future. We aim to create a sustainable franchise for the future, so we can continue to fulfill our
purpose, which is to make a difference for clients by focusing on their most decisive moments in
business and in life.
Embedding our corporate values
As a bank built for entrepreneurs, we are committed to cultivating our ‘Think YES’ mentality by being
flexible and agile and by matching our clients’ can-do attitude. Our everyday decisions and actions are
guided by three corporate values, which differentiate us in the market:
1. Professional: Our in-depth sector knowledge, expert financial solutions and agile execution are
the foundation of our success.
2. Entrepreneurial: We are a sound, enterprising bank focused on our clients’ most decisive
moments. Our clients require a bank that can respond quickly to their needs.
3. Inventive: We provide bespoke solutions and encourage our people to think creatively to meet
our clients’ financial needs. 
Products and markets
NIBC serves around 700 mid-market businesses and nearly 400,000 retail clients from our offices in
The Hague, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Brussels. In this section, we provide an overview of
the most important dynamics in the markets in which we operate.
Corporate clients
Operating in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, our Corporate clients business offers advice and
debt, mezzanine and equity financing solutions to entrepreneurs across select sectors and sub-sectors
in which we have strong expertise and market positions.
We mainly serve the dynamic mid-market, which includes companies with an annual turnover of
between EUR 50 million and EUR 500 million. There are an estimated 3,000 businesses within this
category in the Netherlands, while in Germany there are about 11,000 businesses with these
characteristics as part of the country’s Mittelstand.
14 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Many of our corporate clients are private or family-owned businesses and include corporations, family
offices and entrepreneurial investors, as well as financial institutions, institutional investors and
financial sponsors. These companies are usually participants in major national and international supply
chains within their respective sectors, and are often disruptors in their markets, challenging the spaces
of larger corporations and enabling innovation to take hold.
The mid-market is dynamic by nature and requires a bank that can respond quickly and in a highly
flexible way. Our aim is to meet the market’s requirements at decisive moments such as mergers and
acquisitions, management buy-outs, investments and strategic financings and re-financings. Mid-market
businesses are usually long-term oriented and not overly leveraged, which reflects the type of banking
relationships they desire.
Within the mid-market, our focus is on the supply chain economies of selected industries, in which
our expertise is strongest. These include Commercial Real Estate (CRE), Food, Agri, Retail & Health
(FAR&H), Industries & Manufacturing (I&M), Infrastructure & Renewables (I&R), Offshore Energy (OE),
Shipping & Intermodal (S&I) and Telecom, Media, Technology & Services (TMT&S).
Retail clients
Through our Retail clients operations, we support clients in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium
by offering mortgages, online savings and brokerage products that are accessible, easy to understand
and fairly priced. In mortgages, we provide a full range of mainstream products – from 1 to 30 year
maturities – and target clients in underserved market segments with tailored solutions such as buy-
to-let, mortgages for the self-employed and the negative equity mortgage. In savings, we offer flexible
and fixed term products under the NIBC Direct brand, which is known for its straightforward client-
centric features and unambiguous terms and conditions.
Trends in the world around us
Demand for our products and services is closely linked to the various stages of the economic cycle
and developments in the sectors in which we operate. Below we present a quick overview of the
most important trends in 2017, on which we will elaborate in the sections dedicated to our
Corporate and Retail client activities.
Corporate clients:
■ The impact of digitalisation on sectors ranging from Infrastructure & Renewables to Telecom,
Media, Technology & Services;
■ The shift from bricks to clicks in the retail world;
■ The healthcare and life sciences sector that is on a transformative journey and simultaneously
building a patient centric culture;
■ The transformation from fossil fuel to green energy.
Retail clients:
■ The competition from new market entrants, which is putting additional pressure on spreads for
mainstream mortgages in the Netherlands;

interest rates;

Through the Corporate client activities, we provide a wide range of customised products and
solutions to mid-sized companies and entrepreneurs. We do this either by deploying our own
balance sheet or by raising funds in the capital markets. Within the mid-market, we focus on seven
sectors where we can best leverage our expertise and relationships.
Retail client offering provides mortgage loans, including Buy-to-Let, online retail saving deposits via
NIBC Direct and brokerage services (in Germany). In 2016, we started a dual-track strategy for
mainstream mortgages that focuses on both origination for our own balance sheet and for
institutional investors via OTM mandates.
Treasury and Asset Liability Management operate the treasury function and manage our balance
sheet with strong focus on interest, liquidity and capital risks. There is a close cooperation between
Treasury and Risk Management, and also with the operations to ensure that NIBC’s overall risk
appetite is aligned with its strategy and capital requirements.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 17
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Risk Management is the cornerstone of our sustainable growth strategy. Our risk management
framework helps us implement and execute our strategy, and provides guidance with regards to client
interests, product suitability and compliance with laws and regulations. NIBC works with a ‘three lines
of defence’ model, which begins with the responsibility that each employee must take within the risk
management framework. Our risk appetite, as determined by the Managing Board, defines the
amount and type of risk the organisation is willing to accept.
The Corporate Centre consists of HR & Corporate Communications, Internal Audit, Legal,
Compliance, Sustainability, Operations & Facilities, Technology, Finance & Tax and Strategy &
Development:
■ HR aims to foster a culture that supports our ‘Think YES’ approach and helps to ensure that NIBC
is within the top quartile of the employer benchmark. Corporate Communications is
responsible for engaging with our external and internal stakeholders.
■ Internal Audit performs operational audits based on their annual audit plan, which is approved by
the Supervisory Board and reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
■ Legal provides legal support to the organisation, including managing the group’s legal risks and
NIBC’s reputation. Compliance is responsible for independent oversight of policies, procedures
and core processes to ensure that NIBC and its employees act in conformity with all applicable
laws and regulations, while Sustainability focuses on the embedding of sustainable practices
across the core processes of the Bank.
■ Operations & Facilities and Technology focus on supporting the Bank’s operational and IT
requirements. These departments work closely alongside the operations to further improve the
clients’ experience when doing business with NIBC.
■ Finance & Tax focuses on the preparation of financial statements, regulatory reports and
management information for internal and external stakeholders.
■ Strategy & Development plays an active role in challenging the business with regard to new
opportunities and important decisions and advises the Managing Board on strategic issues.
2017 in a nutshell
2017 was an extremely strong year for NIBC. As CEO Paulus de Wilt said in his introductory letter:
“Our culture based on our three core values, Professional, Entrepreneurial and Inventive, is thriving
and we are moving full steam ahead with our client-focused strategy.”
Here is an overview of the most important highlights for 2017, about which you can read more in
the Letter from the CEO and various other sections throughout this Annual Report, including
Financial Performance, Corporate Clients and Retail Clients.
■ Net profit for 2017 more than doubled to EUR 210 million (FY 2016: EUR 102 million)
■ Return on Equity doubled to 10.8% for the full year 2017, compared to 5.4% full year 2016;
■ Corporate client offering added substantial revenues from fee and investment income on the back
of increased client activity;
■ Retail client offering realised strong growth in mortgage origination for own book as well as for
third parties;
■ Cost/income ratio for the bank improved to 44%;
■ The full year 2017 was positively influenced by the sale of a German CRE legacy portfolio
(EUR 47 million);
18 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ Solid solvency ratios, with the fully loaded CET 1 ratio increasing to 21.4% from 16.8%;
■ Both Fitch and S&P updated their rating for NIBC Bank to ‘BBB’;
■ NIBC has paid a second interim dividend of EUR 66 million totalling EUR 96 million (pay-out 45%).
Outlook
In 2018, we will continue to add value to our expanding client base with innovative solutions, speed
and reliability that our clients can count on. This includes our integrated offering through NIBC
Markets, which strengthens our position as the go-to partner for decisive moments. We will increase
our attention on promising sectors and sub-sectors where we see good opportunities to add value
for clients. Overall, market conditions have improved in the light of the positive economic climate,
however, we expect the opportunities in Offshore Energy and Shipping & Intermodal sectors to
remain limited in the near future. We will continue to help our clients navigate the challenging
environment of these sectors. In addition, we foresee that the prolonged low interest rate climate is
putting more pressure on the risk/reward balance in both corporate and retail markets. Especially in
this environment, we continue to actively manage the composition of our portfolios to ensure
sustainable profitability within our risk appetite.
Throughout the year, we will further strengthen our product teams, particularly in mezzanine equity
capabilities, supporting our combined senior debt with mezzanine funding offering.
We will also continue to build on our asset management expertise and focus on further expanding
our ‘Originate-to-Manage’ activities for institutional investors.
We expect retail market conditions in 2018 to remain volatile, with consumers willing to be more
open towards alternative investment opportunities and consumption. Our approach will be to
continue exploring opportunities in underserviced areas of the market with new propositions, while
expanding our product portfolio and striking new partnerships. Our focus will also be on removing
remaining frictions from our customer journey and to improve the overall experience.
In the coming months, we will continue to work on our strategic alternatives, which may include an
IPO. This process is ongoing and preparations are progressing well, however a final decision will be
made at a later date and amongst others will be dependent upon market circumstances.

The income statement in the previous table differs from that presented in the consolidated financial
statements 2016 due to the treatment of 'Special items', explained further in this section. This only
affects the presentation of the income statement and not the bottom-line net profit figures. See note
1 to the (condensed) consolidated financial statements for more information and a full reconciliation
between the two presentations of the income statement.
As of 30 June 2016, the acquired NIBC Markets is fully accounted for in the NIBC figures. The impact
of NIBC Markets on the net profit in 2017 amounts to a net loss of EUR 7 million (2016: net loss of
EUR 2 million), mainly as a result of the discontinuation of the non-core part of the business and
related reorganisation expenses of nearly EUR 5 million.
The column 'Vijlma' in the table above displays a net result totaling EUR 47 million impacting net
interest income, net trading income, impairments of financial assets and tax. Vijlma relates to a
specific German commercial real estate legacy exposure of which the underlying assets (investment
property) were sold in 2017 and for which the final settlement will take place in 2018. In the
remainder of this paragaph we will mainly assess the performance in 2017 against that of 2016,
excluding the results from the Vijlma transaction in 2017.
Small differences are possible in this table due to rounding.

The driving force behind the improved performance lies in the Corporate and Retail client activities,
which continued to develop the client franchise, supported by the continued decrease of the funding
spreads. This positive development is also reflected in increased net interest income, net fee and
commission income and the development of the equity investment portfolio on the back of the
positive sentiment in the equity markets.
Origination of corporate loans in 2017 excluding the funding line to BEEQUIP amounted to
EUR 3.1 billion, the same level as in 2016. Corporate client assets decreased slightly by nearly 3% in
2017, with origination being more than offset by (p)repayments, which include a decrease of the
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 21
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
commercial real estate legacy portfolio by nearly EUR 0.3 billion and foreign currency effects of nearly
- EUR 0.4 billion, mainly due to the weakening of the USD and to a lesser extent the GBP. Excluding
these currency effects and the decrease of the commercial real estate legacy portfolio the corporate
client assets would have increased in 2017 by more than 3%.
Mortgage loan origination volumes reached EUR 1.9 billion in 2017 (2016: EUR 1.1 billion) of which
EUR 0.3 billion Buy-to-Let and EUR 0.7 billion related to an Originate-to-Manage mandate for
institutional investors. After pre- and repayments, the total mortgage loan portfolio for own book
increased by more than 3% in 2017 from EUR 8.8 billion at year end 2016 to EUR 9.1 billion at year
end 2017, including the acquisition of a mortgage loan portfolio of EUR 0.2 billion in Q3 2017 (+2%).
We continued to decrease our average funding rate in 2017, driving a further improvement of the
net interest margin, while maintaining solid short and long term liquidity ratios, well above the
minimum appetite. Furhtermore, the solvency ratio (CET 1) is strong at year-end 2017 with 21.4%,
able to absorb the effects of IFRS 9 and potential effects of Basel IV, well above the SREP
requirement.
The following section describes the financial developments and analyses the performance of NIBC in
2017.
Operating income
Operating income further increased in 2017 from EUR 381 million to EUR 512 million, an increase of
34%. Of this increase EUR 42 million relates to Vijlma and EUR 4 million to NIBC Markets, which
generated EUR 13 million of revenues in 2017 and EUR 9 million in H2 2016. Excluding these two
items operating income displayed an increase of 23% from EUR 372 million in 2016 to
EUR 457 million in 2017. The increase of operating income was driven by the strong underlying
performance of the corporate and retail franchises, with operating income from corporate activities
increasing by 29% and from retail activities by 14%, as well as by the continued improvement of
NIBC's funding curves.

interest margin from 1.44% for 2016 to 1.61% for 2017. The growth of net interest income was
driven by the improvement of the funding profile and related reduction of funding expenses, also
supported by the increase of the client business in both the Corporate and Retail client offering:

■ Although the drawn corporate loan portfolio decreased in 2017, the average level of this portfolio
in 2017 was roughly equal to the average level in 2016. Net interest income from the corporate
loan portfolio increased in 2017 among others from the higher average portfolio spread in 2017
compared to 2016;
■ The mortgage loan portfolio increased in 2017 by more than 3% to EUR 9.1 billion. The average
mortgage loan portfolio in 2017 was nearly 7% above the average level in 2016. This includes the
Buy-to-Let portfolio, that increased to EUR 617 million in 2017, coming from EUR 371 million at
year-end 2016;
■ The funding profile of the bank combined with, on average, significantly lower funding costs,
contributed to the increase of net interest income in 2017. The average funding spread above
base decreased by 14 basis points in 2017, following a decrease of 21 basis points in 2016;
■ The strong EUR to the USD and GBP had a negative impact on net interest income of
approximately EUR 8 million in 2017.

Net fee and commission income
In 2017 net fee and commission income increased by 69% to EUR 54 million from EUR 32 million in
2016. The increase of EUR 22 million includes EUR 3 million from NIBC Markets. Excluding the fees
from NIBC Markets of EUR 7 million in 2017 and EUR 4 million in 2016 net fee and commission
income increased by 68%, reflecting our continuous investments in client relationships.
All fee categories improved:
■ The increase of investment management fees by 75% to EUR 14 million in 2017 from
EUR 8 million in 2016 predominately resulted from higher performance fees from strong results
on our equity investment stakes, partially on the back of the improved sentiment in the equity
markets;
■ M&A and advisory fees nearly doubled to EUR 11 million in 2017 from EUR 6 million in 2016,
partially driven by the successful execution of one large client transaction;
■ Lending related fees increased by 36% to EUR 19 million in 2017 from EUR 14 million in 2016,
displaying the continued growth of the corporate client franchise;
■ The mortgage loan ‘Originate-to-Manage’ activities - started in 2016 - contributed nearly
EUR 4 million to fee income in 2017 (2016: nil).

Investment income
Investment income is sensitive to the sentiment in the equity markets and can therefore be more
volatile year on year. In 2017 the equity investment portfolio performed well on the back of the
economic upturn of the economics of North Western Europe, leading to an increase of investment
income from EUR 31 million in 2016 to EUR 67 million in 2017. The improvement in investment
income was mainly driven by a higher valuation of the portfolio. The total equity investment portfolio
increased in 2017 by 31% to EUR 343 million, which is mainly the result of new investments of
EUR 35 million, sales of EUR 15 million and revaluation of EUR 51 million.
Net trading income
Net trading income increased to EUR 24 million in 2017 compared to EUR 12 million in 2016.
Excluding gains in 2017 of EUR 25 million from Vijlma net trading income decreased by
EUR 13 million to a loss of EUR 1 million in 2017:
■ In 2017 the revaluation of residential mortgage loans amounted to +EUR 14 million in net trading
income compared to +EUR 9 million in 2016. This revaluation includes credit losses of
EUR 2 million, an improvement from the EUR 4 million in 2016. Please be aware that as of
1 January 2018 this revaluation will no longer be in our income statement as - following the
implementation of IFRS 9 - these mortgage loans will be reclassified from Fair Value through Profit
or Loss to Amortised Costs. As of 1 January 2018 credit losses will be booked in the 'Impairments
of financial assets' line-item of the income statement;
■ NIBC Markets contributed EUR 7 million to net trading income in 2017 compared to
EUR 5 million in 2016;
■ The 2016 revenues included EUR 9 million of revaluation gains on corporate loans at Fair Value
through Profit or Loss, mainly from the repayment on a loan that was previously valued at below
par;
■ Hedges of the mortgage loan pipeline and hedging ineffectiveness led in 2017 to EUR 7 million
higher losses than in 2016. Furthermore net trading income includes a EUR 4 million loss from a
prepayment penalty related to the early redemption of a funding transaction.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses in 2017 of EUR 223 million increased by EUR 29 million (+15%), from
EUR 194 million in 2016. The increase mainly relates to 4 items:
1. Operating expenses of NIBC Markets amounted to EUR 21 million in 2017 (2016:
EUR 11 million), of which EUR 5 million reorganisation expenses. These reorganisation expenses
reflect the discontinuation of the non-core (asset management related) part of the business of
NIBC Markets (as announced in January 2017) enabling us to focus on the integration of the
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 25
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Equity Capital Markets / Debt Capital Markets part of the business into our corporate client
offering. This integration was concluded in 2017. The operating expenses of NIBC Markets for
2016 relate to H2 2016;
2. Operating expenses include a provision in payroll expenses with respect to the review of our
strategic alternatives and related process and preparations, further elaborated on in the CEO-
letter of this document;
3. External servicing expenses in the retail client offering increased in 2017 by EUR 5 million, of
which EUR 2 million expenses for the transition of a part of the mortgage loan portfolio to
another service provider (which will lead to more efficiency and lower servicing expenses in the
future) and EUR 3 million for the substantially higher origination level of mortgage loans, including
the Originate-to-Manage offering;
4. IT related expenses increased by EUR 12 million in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase mainly
relates to the strengthening of the current infrastructure, improvements of business platforms,
including phasing out of some legacy systems, regulatory projects such as MIFID II and IFRS 9 and
an IT transition programme started in H2 2016.
With the exception of the 4 items explained above, operating expenses remained relatively stable in
2017 compared to 2016.
Payroll expenses
Excluding the payroll expenses of NIBC Markets of EUR 16 million in 2017 (which includes the
reorganisation expenses of EUR 5 million) and EUR 7 million in 2016 and the payroll expenses
related to strategic alternatives mentioned under item 2 above, payroll expenses remained relatively
stable in 2017 at a level of EUR 88 million.
Total FTEs decreased in 2017 from 704 at the end of 2016 to 666 at the end of 2017, driven by the
integration of NIBC Markets and the IT transition programme.

other operating expenses remained stable in 2017 at a level of EUR 73 million.
Depreciation decreased from EUR 7 million in 2016 to EUR 5 million in 2017, reflecting certain

26 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Regulatory expenses decreased in 2017 by 7% to EUR 14 million in 2017, driven by a lower
resolution levy and a lower DGS-charge due to the lower level of our savings volume.
Our cost / income ratio improved from 51% for the full year 2016 to 44% in 2017 and 47% excluding
Vijlma. This fully loaded (including regulatory expenses) cost / income ratio is at the lower end of
what is currently displayed in the European banking industry, allowing us to continuously invest in the
NIBC organisation, both in innovation and product development as well as in the Think YES culture
of NIBC.

Tax
Including Vijlma, tax in 2017 amounts to EUR 42 million, implying an effective tax rate of 16% of the
profit before tax. The effective tax rate lies below the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. This mainly
relates to the impact of income not subject to tax, predominately from equity investments and
investments in associates. Income from these investments is tax exempt under Dutch tax law if NIBC
has a stake of more than 5%.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 27
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Special items 2016
A net loss of EUR 2 million displayed as a separate line-item in the income statement of 2016 mainly
relates to the following special items:
■ A one-off gain (badwill) of EUR 22 million followed from the acquisition of NIBC Markets (former
SNS Securities) per 30 June 2016. This discount on the acquisition price partly reflects the future
investments needed for development of this franchise;
■ We incurred EUR 18 million after tax credit loss on resolving pre-crisis retail exposure; and
■ After tax operating expenses of EUR 6 million relate to the outsourcing of our technical IT-
environment during 2016 and 2017 and to the alignment of NIBC Markets to our business model
and further development of this franchise. The outsourcing of the technical IT-environment
concerns outsourcing the network and infrastructure services, technical application management,
client support (service desk) and digital workplace.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interest
In September 2017 NIBC issued an AT1 instrument amounting to EUR 200 million with a 6% coupon
and a 7 years non-call. Under IFRS, the AT1 instrument is classified as equity. The interest paid on this
AT1 instrument is accounted for under this heading, but classified as interest for tax purposes.
Net profit
NIBC’s net profit attributable to the shareholder of the company more than doubled from
EUR 102 million in 2016 to EUR 210 million in 2017. Excluding Vijlma , profitability also displayed a
substantial improvement, with net profit attributable to the shareholder of the company at a level of
EUR 163 million (+60%) and return on equity at 8.4% (+56%).
This substantial improvement, among others driven by both the growth of the operating income and
the improvement of the credit quality of the portfolios, reflects the continued strong foundations of
our client franchise. This development is displayed in 2017 by an increase of net interest income, net
fee income and investment income, as well as the decrease of impairments. The improvement was
achieved whilst managing operating expenses that in 2017 - with the exception of some specific
expense categories discussed earlier - remained stable.
The cost/income ratio improved from 51% in 2016 to 47% (excluding Vijlma) and 44% in 2017.

Assets
The drawn corporate loan book (including lease receivables) decreased by nearly 7% in 2017, with
new origination of EUR 3.1 billion being offset by (p)repayments, a partial repayment of a commercial
real estate legacy portfolio of EUR 260 million and USD and GBP exchange rate effects of -
EUR 340 million. Excluding these last two items, the drawn corporate loan book would have
remained stable in 2017.
The risk profile of the corporate loan book improved in line with our objectives, driven by both new
origination and further repayments and sales of several larger exposures. The average expected loss
on the performing loan portfolio improved from 35 bps at year-end 2016 to 31 bps. The defaulted
exposure decreased in 2017 from 6.6% to 4.3% of the total loan exposure and the impaired
exposure from 6.3% to 3.3%.
The mortgage loan portfolio (netted with the related savings from endowment policies) grew in
2017 by more than 3% to EUR 9.1 billion from EUR 8.8 billion, supported by origination for own
book of EUR 1.2 billion and a portfolio acquisition of EUR 0.2 billion. NIBC’s mortgage loan portfolio
consists of three parts: Buy-to-Let mortgage loans originated since 2015, owner occupied mortgage
loans originated since 2013 and owner occupied mortgage loans originated before the crisis.
■ Since the crisis, we have made significant choices regarding our business model and mortgage
loans originated since 2013 - both owner occupied and Buy-to-Let - are held to maturity and
accounted for at amortised cost;
■ The mortgage loans originated before the crisis are valued at fair value through profit or loss
(FVtPL). This valuation method was chosen when IFRS was first adopted, reflecting the ‘originate
to distribute’ business model NIBC had at that time. As since the crisis we have made other
choices regarding our business model for mortgage loans, these loans, although still accounted for
at FVtPL, are in practice now also hold to maturity. At the end of 2017, a EUR 97 million
(31 December 2016: EUR 98 million) positive revaluation before tax on the outstanding mortgage
loans and related hedges was accounted for in our balance sheet due to credit spread movements.
This revaluation amount can be broken down into a before tax revaluation gain on the mortgage
loans of EUR 321 million and a before tax revaluation loss on the related hedging swaps of
EUR 224 million.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 29
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Derivative balances have decreased significantly in 2017. Part of the decrease is driven by market
developments. As the positions mainly relate to hedges of interest rate risks, the interest rate
movements of 2017 have affected the balances. In addition to these regular developments, two
separate actions have led to an additional reduction of the derivative balances. During 2017, NIBC
has reviewed its hedging positions and has closed out many offsetting positions and replaced off-
market derivatives with new derivatives at current market rates. NIBC has also been able to apply
netting to more derivative positions. As settlement processes and systems have been adjusted
following the implementation of central clearing, more positions are eligible for netting. This has led to
an additional reduction of the reported derivative balances.
Impact of IFRS 9 with respect to assets
For NIBC the main impact of IFRS 9 per 1 January 2018 is the reclassification of the mortgage loan
portfolio at FVtPL to amortised cost, in line with the hold to maturity business model and with
general market practice. This reclassification will result in a one-off loss of the revaluation amount on
the mortgage loans amounting to EUR 321 million before tax. The net of tax amount will be charged
directly through shareholders’ equity. The magnitude of this loss at 1 January 2018 has a negative
impact on NIBC’s CET 1 ratio of 3.6%-points. As this reduction of equity at transition date includes
the one-sided effect of interest rates with the associated hedges remaining unadjusted, the impact is
materially larger than only the underlying credit revaluation of the related mortgage loans. This one-
sided effect will result in a future positive pull-to-par effect through operating income for an estimated
amount equal to the before tax revaluation loss on the related hedging swaps over the remaining life
of the reclassified portfolio. Based on the interest rate maturity and characteristics of the underlying
seasoned mortgage loans and hedges, we estimate that approximately 85% of this positive effect on
operating income will be realised in the period 2018 to 2024. We expect that the majority of this
amount will be realised through net interest income.
In addition to the reclassification of the FVtPL mortgage loan portfolio, the change from an incurred
loss impairment model to an expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model will impact the required
level of loan provisions. We have developed new models to comply with the new requirements of
ECL under IFRS 9. In H1 2018 further testing will be performed. Based on the current calculations,
we estimate a downward transition impact of 0.4%-points on 1 January 2018 on the Bank's CET 1
ratio.
Overall, there will be a reduction of capital following the transition to IFRS 9, but as at 1 January 2018
we expect both NIBC Bank and NIBC Holding to display a solid CET 1 ratio of 17.4% and 15.3%
respectively, above both our current SREP level requirements and our medium-term objectives.
The following graph illustrates the transition impact of IFRS 9 on total assets and the CET 1 ratio of
NIBC.

Funding and liquidity
Diversification of funding has been a key part of our strategy since early 2008, when we started to
build the retail savings franchise. We continued to diversify our funding sources in 2017. Overall, the
funding mix mid 2017 shows a healthy balance between wholesale and retail:
■ Retail savings decreased by 4% to EUR 9.3 billion, displaying a managed outflow of EUR 0.4 billion.
The share of retail savings in term deposits decreased to 42% (end of year 2016: 44%), in line with
our internal appetite.
■ With respect to wholesale funding we issued a total of nearly EUR 1.7 billion in 2017:
■ A EUR 500 million senior unsecured bond was issued in January 2017 at a maturity of 5 years,
paying interest of 1.50% above the 3 months swap rate;
■ In March 2017 we participated in TLTRO-issuance totaling nearly EUR 450 million at a maturity
of 4 years;
■ In September 2017, a EUR 200 million perpetual AT1 transaction was issued with a coupon of
6.00%. Please note that from an IFRS perspective this transaction is treated as capital and the
coupon as dividend;
■ We raised EUR 535 million in privately placed senior funding in various currencies and
maturities during 2017, at an average maturity of 2 years.
■ Institutional deposits attracted in Germany under the Einlagensicherungsfonds (ESF) increased by
10% in 2017 to nearly EUR 1.4 billion (FY 2016: EUR 1.2 billion), following an increase of 9% in
2016. Our current limit under the ESF amounts to EUR 1.7 billion.

Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 31
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The healthy funding and liquidity position at year end 2017 is evidenced by the following ratios:
■ A Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 196% (versus 124% at year-end 2016) and Net Stable Funding Ratio
of 117% (112% at year-end 2016);
■ An asset encumbrance ratio of 26% (2016: 29%), which meets our objective to maintain this ratio
below 30%; and
■ A loan-to-deposit ratio of 150% (2016: 148%), which is in line with our objective to maintain this
ratio at a level between 140% -160%.
Impact of IFRS 9 with respect to liabilities
Part of the unsecured funding portfolio is classified at FVtPL. As of 1 January 2016, following the early
application of 'IFRS 9 - own credit requirements', the fair value changes from liabilities designated at
Fair Value through Profit or Loss are accounted for as comprehensive income directly to
shareholder’s equity. At year-end 2017 a debit of EUR 86 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 171 million debit) on the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss is accounted for in
the balance sheet due to own credit spread movements. As NIBC has already applied IFRS 9 for
these liabilities, no further impact is expected at the full transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.
Solvency
NIBC Bank’s solvency ratios were maintained at a solid level in 2017, with the fully loaded CET 1
ratio increasing in 2017 from 16.8% in 2016 to 21.4% and the fully loaded BIS ratio from 21.3% in
2016 to 27.2% in 2017.
As of 2015, we took into consideration in the calculation of the regulatory solvency ratios the full
RWAs of a commercial real estate transaction in which we had only a partial stake. This exposure
was fully sold in H1 2017 lowering the RWAs by EUR 1.0 billion and with a positive impact on the
CET 1 ratio of 1.7%-points.

The solvency ratio levels are comfortably above the required SREP-levels set by DNB for NIBC
Holding in July 2017. Excluding the applicable combined buffer requirement (of 1.25% for 2017) and
the Pillar II guidance (which is not disclosed and not relevant for the Maximum Distributable
Amount), the required SREP-level for NIBC Holding’s minimum own funds amounts to 12.0%. This
requirement consists of an 8% Pillar 1 requirement and a 4% Pillar 2 requirement. The total CET 1
minimum requirement is 8.5% consisting of the minimum Pillar 1 requirement (4.5%) and the Pillar 2
requirement (4.0%).
32 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In addition, NIBC Holding should comply with phasing in the combined buffer requirements,
consisting of a Capital Conservation Buffer (1.25%) and a Countercyclical Buffer (0.0%) in 2017. This
translates into an aggregate 9.75% CET 1 requirement for 2017. In the years 2018 and 2019 the CET
1 requirement will increase, as the Capital Conservation Buffer is further phased-in (by 0.625%-point
per annum). This results in an expected aggregate CET 1 requirement of 11.0% in 2019 based on
current SREP. NIBC Holding’s near-term objective for its minimum CET 1 ratio is 14.0%.
Taking into account the removal of an add-on in SREP capital the moment that we no longer have
residential mortgage loans at Fair Value through Profit or Loss and a further phase-in of the Capital
Conservation Buffer, our SREP levels at 1 January 2018 compared to the actual solvency ratios at that
date are displayed below.

Basel IV
An agreement was reached on the Basel III reforms Basel IV in December 2017. While certain
elements still require more clarity, based on a current assessment and interpretation of the Basel IV
regulation we expect the impact to be in a range of 20-30% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) by 2027,
which implies an impact of -2.5 to -3.5%-points on the post IFRS 9 CET 1 ratio. This does not take
into account possible management actions, nor potential changes to Pillar 2 requirements. Note this
also assumes the current portfolio to be the same in 2027, as well as RWA based on the current
economic environment.
An uncertainty for banks is that the new framework will have to be incorporated into legislation
within the European Union based on the European Commission proposal. This entire process is
expected to take several years. Please be aware that during this process of endorsement by the EU
and subsequent transfer to local law, certain adjustments to the regulation may be implemented
We will meet the final requirements and as before we will continue executing our strategy for our
clients and delivering growth at good returns.
Dividend pay-out
The Managing Board proposes an interim dividend pay-out of EUR 66 million in addition to the
interim dividend of EUR 31 million already paid out based on the H1 2017 performance. This second
interim dividend amounts to EUR 1.06 per share (after the EUR 0.49 per share at H1 2017), leading
to a total dividend per share of EUR EUR 1.55 for the full-year 2017. The full-year 2016 dividend
amounted to EUR 0.40 per share.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 33
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The total pay-out ratio in 2017 amounts to 45% of the net profit attributable to the shareholder of
the company. The calculation of the maximum distributable amount, as set out in article 2.2.1 of the
Regulation 'specific provisions CRDIV and CRR' of De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. of 9 December
2013, containing requirements to the maximum distributable amount and the calculation thereof,
provides enough head room to pay out this dividend.
Medium-term objectives
The targets for the period 2015 to 2017 were articulated in our Annual Report 2014. These were
based on the outcome of the annual Strategy Day of the Supervisory Board and Managing Board,
which was held in June 2014. In H1 2017 we assessed NIBC’s performance against these and other
relevant targets, and found that overall, we were ahead of plan. At the Strategy Day held in June
2017, new objectives for the near term were proposed and discussed. These objectives were
presented in our H1 2017 Interim Report. Further discussions in the past months on the back of the
improved performance in the second half of 2017 have led to further adjustments of our objectives
for NIBC Holding.
These adjusted medium-term objectives for NIBC Holding are displayed below and have been set on
the basis of certain assumptions in respect of the future impact on NIBC Holding’s capital position
from the implementation of Basel IV and other regulatory developments, considering in particular the
anticipated capital requirements which may arise, and taking into account NIBC Holding’s current
dividend policy.

CORPORATE CLIENTS
2017 was a succesful year for NIBC corporate client offering, It succesfully closed a large number of
high-profile client deals as sector and product teams worked increasingly closely together. Good
results have been achieved in almost all sectors and sub-sectors, and customer satisfaction has never
been higher.
NIBC corporate client offering is further transforming into a full-service, mid-market bank that has
the capability to advise its clients on capital market transactions, among other things, and to invest in
and lend to clients from its own balance sheet. In other words, NIBC is equipped to add value on the
entire liability side of the client's balance sheet.
Seven sectors
Our focus is on mid-market corporates across seven sectors - divided into sub-sectors - in which we
have deep-seated knowledge and strong positions that enable us to provide clear solutions for our
clients at decisive moments. NIBC corporate client offering operates from three countries: The
Netherlands, Germany and the UK. The seven sectors are:
■ Commercial Real Estate;
34 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ Food, Agri, Retail & Health;
■ Industries & Manufacturing;
■ Infrastructure & Renewables;
■ Offshore Energy;
■ Shipping & Intermodal;
■ Telecom, Media, Technology & Services.
Product offering
NIBC corporate client offering serves clients in all matters relating to the liability side of the client's
balance sheet (from loans and equity participations to capital market access) and provides them with
bespoke advice. Our product portfolio comprises Balance sheet products and Advisory/Capital
Market products, which are subdivided into the following seven main categories:
Balance sheet products
Leveraged Finance
We finance acquisitions of midcap companies by private equity funds. We focus primarily on
companies with an enterprise value of EUR 50-500 million. Leveraged Finance operates from The
Hague, London and Frankfurt. In the mid-market we are one of the three largest players in the
Benelux, and among the largest five players in the German midmarket.
The total loan portfolio at year-end 2017 was EUR 1.6 billion (2016: EUR 1.7 billion).
Receivables Finance
We develop tailor-made financing solutions based on contracted cash flows. Receivables Finance
operates to a large extent in the Telecom, Media, Technology & Services sector and increasingly in
the Industries & Manufacturing sector.
The total loan portfolio at year-end 2017 was EUR 0.8 billion (2016: EUR 0.7 billion).
Mezzanine and Equity Solutions
We offer flexible risk-bearing solutions to support successful companies at their most decisive
moments, e.g. at management buy-outs and acquisitions. We provide flexible capital solutions
including minority equity participations (20-50%, participation, capital at EUR 5-25 million) and
mezzanine loans.
The total mezzanine and equity portfolio at year-end 2017 was EUR 0.6 billion (2016:
EUR 0.5 billion).
Corporate Lending
Since 1945, NIBC has supported clients requiring medium to long-term financing through its
corporate lending solutions. These range from loans for general corporate use and working capital
solutions, to corporate acquisitions and changing shareholder structures.
The total loan portfolio at year-end 2017 was EUR 1.9 billion (2016: EUR 1.7 billion).
Asset and Cash Flow Financing
We provide financing products based on cash flow combined with collateral value, which can
combine both project and corporate elements.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 35
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The total loan portfolio at year-end 2017 was EUR 5.1 million (2016: EUR 5.6 billion).
Advisory and Capital Market Products
Capital Markets
NIBC's Capital Markets has been helping clients access capital markets since June 2016, offering a
wide range of tailor-made solutions for capital market financing.
Corporate Finance
Our multidisciplinary advisory team across Debt Advisory, Equity Capital Market (ECM) and Mergers
and Acquisitions (M&A) advises on and executes a wide range of buy-side and sell-side M&A
transactions for public and private mid-market corporates and financial sponsors.
Approach and strategy in the market
NIBC is a mid-sized bank that focuses on a number of niche markets, i.e. the sectors and sub-sectors
listed above. As a result, we are well versed in these niche markets and are very familiar with our
clients, with whom we build long-lasting relationships.
Unlike the larger banks, we focus mainly on the middle segment of these markets, providing tailored
solutions that are often unavailable elsewhere, and we aim to think and act like entrepreneurs. An
example that sets us apart is our capability to combine senior debt with mezzanine funding and
equity.
We have the sector expertise and wide product range to develop truly tailor-made solutions swiftly
and at decisive moments for our clients. We have clearly chosen not to offer routine daily banking
services such as current accounts or payments. We lack the scale to benefit from such services,
preferring instead to serve our clients with products we excel at.
As in the past, we still focus on mid-sized and usually family-owned companies in the Netherlands,
Germany and the UK. Our growing product range also serves other relevant client groups such as
private equity investors, institutional investors, financial sponsors and large corporate clients.
The ease with which NIBC's diversity of product and sector teams find each other and collaborate
closely to develop bespoke solutions for a client within a short time span is inherent in the bank's
values (professional, entrepreneurial and inventive) and size.
Over the past years, we have been focusing more and more on short-term financing solutions rather
than large long-term loans. However, our close ties with institutional investors enable us to offer
excellent long-term solutions for clients with high-volume capital needs. In 2017 we made further
progress in developing our ‘Originate-to-Manage’ strategy. We are working with a growing number of
institutional investors, our role being to originate and manage mid-market leveraged loans. These
partnerships allow investors to benefit from our unique mid-market franchise and enhance our
offering to corporate clients with larger senior and mezzanine tickets.
Trends and challenges in the world around us
NIBC corporate client offering operates in seven sectors. The choices we make within these sectors
and the propositions we offer tie in with trends we notice or expect in the world around us. Some
major trends we responded to in recent years:
36 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ Digitalisation. In 2017 the Infrastructure & Renewables and Telecom, Media, Technology &
Services teams responded powerfully to this trend. For example: Infrastructure & Renewables was
traditionally strong in providing long-term financing for prisons, schools, toll roads, etc. Over the
past two years, they shifted their focus to financing digital infrastructure (e.g. data centres and
optical fibres);
■ E-commerce. The retail world is transforming from bricks to clicks. This often calls for different
methods of financing, including financing based on cash flows and contract portfolios rather than
collateral;
■ Healthcare & life sciences. This progressive sector is on a transformative technological journey
and simultaneously building a patient centric culture. Both trends are driving the need for cash to
invest in innovation, R&D and new therapeutic or diagnostic products, creating opportunities in
advisory and capital markets finance solutions;
■ The energy transformation. The transition from fossil fuels to green and electric gained
momentum in 2017. In response, our Offshore Energy sector (previously known as the Oil & Gas
Services sector) has redirected its strategy to actively enable our clients in their transition towards
clean energy. Of course, the energy transition also has an impact on our Shipping & Intermodal
sector, which is going through a transformation as well. Together with two other Dutch banks,
NIBC has been among the first banks in Europe to set more strict standards for ship financing by
drawing up the Responsible Ship Recycling Standards (RSRS). Although NIBC is not directly involved
in the financing of ship recycling, we recognize that ship recycling is part of the shipping industry
supply chain in which we are active. Our initiative has proven to be effective, as throughout the
year 2017 several other prominent European ship finance banks joined the RSRS initiative.
Identifying and addressing trends is in NIBC's DNA and is what drives all of our product and sector
teams. As a result, transformation is an ongoing process within NIBC corporate client offering,
seeking new opportunities to support clients.
Challenges
In 2017 competition in NIBC's corporate markets intensified due to the widespread availability of
liquidity, which was partly the result of the continued low interest rate environment and the
European Central Bank's large-scale asset purchases. This put some of our margins under pressure,
particularly for Corporate Lending. We responded by focusing more on our merchant banking
product suite and less on traditional medium to long-term loans. Our strong performance in 2017
reflects the success of this gradual transformation. The imminent Brexit also posed a challenge for
banks in 2017 and beyond. NIBC has analysed the consequences of Brexit for the bank. The different
scenarios have revealed that this is manageable for the Bank.
Developments and performance
In 2017, the corporate client offering experienced solid growth driven by higher demand across most
activities of the franchise: debt, investing and advice.
We have been able to grow our client franchise in 2017, providing solutions to both new and existing
clients, meeting increasing demand for financing and investments, resulting in newly originated loans
totalling EUR 3.1 billion (excluding financing of BEEQUIP), equal to the level in 2016. Our total
corporate client assets decreased by 3% in 2017, with our origination being more than offset by
(p)repayments, which include a decrease of the commercial real estate legacy portfolio by nearly
EUR 0.3 billion and foreign currency effects of nearly EUR -0.4 billion, mainly due to the weakening of
the USD and to a lesser extent the GBP. Excluding these currency effects and the decrease of the
commercial real estate legacy portfolio our corporate client assets would have increased in 2017 by
more than 3%.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 37
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Our corporate client exposure of EUR 10.0 billion at 31 December 2017 consists of:
■ EUR 9.4 billion corporate loans;
■ EUR 0.1 billion lease receivables;
■ EUR 0.2 billion investment loans;
■ EUR 0.3 billion equity investments.
The corporate loan book developed in line with our ambitions, and improved its risk profile. The
average expected loss on the performing loan portfolio improved from 35 bps to 31 bps at year-end
2017. Our defaulted exposure decreased in 2017 to 4.3% from 6.6% of the total loan exposure and
our impaired exposure to 3.3% from 6.3%. The improvement of both defaulted and impaired
exposures is amongst others the result of a partial sale of a legacy Commercial Real Estate portfolio.

With respect to the financial performance, operating income improved in 2017 by EUR 113 million
(+46%) to EUR 357 million. Of this increase, EUR 42 million relates to a commercial real estate
exposure of which the underlying assets (investment property) were sold in 2017, and EUR 4 million
to NIBC Markets, which generated EUR 13 million of revenues in 2017 and EUR 9 million in H2
2016. Excluding these two items, operating income displayed an increase of 29% from
EUR 235 million in 2016 to EUR 302 million in 2017. This increase of operating income was driven
by the strong underlying performance of the corporate franchise.
Net interest income increased by 26% of which an increase of 10% relates to the commercial real
estate exposure mentioned earlier. The remaining increase was mainly driven by a higher average
portfolio spread in 2017 and lower funding costs. Although - as displayed above - our corporate loan
portfolio decreased in 2017, the average size of the drawn loan portfolio in 2017 was roughly equal
to that for 2016, implying that the decrease of the portfolio did not have a negative impact on net
interest income in 2017.

Investment management Lending related fees M&A NIBC Markets
In 2017 net fee and commission income increased by 56% to EUR 50 million from EUR 32 million in
2016. The increase of EUR 18 million includes EUR 3 million from NIBC Markets. Excluding fees from
NIBC Markets of EUR 7 million in 2017 and EUR 4 million in 2016, net fee and commission income
increased by 54%. All fee categories improved:
■ The increase of investment management fees by 75% to EUR 14 million in 2017 from
EUR 8 million in 2016 was mainly driven by higher performance fees, partially on the back of the
improved sentiment in the equity markets;
■ M&A and advisory fees nearly doubled to EUR 11 million in 2017 from EUR 6 million in 2016;
■ Lending related fees increased by 36% to EUR 19 million in 2017 from EUR 14 million in 2016,
displaying the continued growth of the corporate client franchise.
Investment income is sensitive to the sentiment in the equity markets and can therefore be volatile
year on year. In 2017 the underlying equity investment portfolio performed well on the back of the
economic upturn of the North-Western economies, leading to an increase of investment income
from EUR 33 million in 2016 to EUR 66 million in H1 2017. The improvement in investment income
was mainly driven by higher valuation of the portfolio. The total equity investment portfolio increased
in 2017 by 31% to EUR 343 million, which is mainly the result of new investments of EUR 35 million,
sales of EUR 15 million and revaluation of EUR 51 million.
Net trading income increased to EUR 37 million in 2017 compared to EUR 16 million in 2016.
Excluding gains in 2017 of EUR 25 million related to the commercial real estate exposure mentioned
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 39
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
earlier, net trading income decreased by EUR 4 million to EUR 12 million in 2017. This decrease
mainly relates to revaluation gains in 2016 on corporate loans at Fair Value through Profit or Loss,
predominately from the repayment on a loan that was previously valued at below par, partially
compensated by increased net trading income from NIBC Markets by EUR 2 million to EUR 7 million
in 2017 from EUR 5 million in 2016.
Operating expenses increased by nearly 3% to EUR 121 million, of which EUR 6 million relates to
NIBC Markets. Excluding NIBC Markets, operating expenses decreased by 3% to 104 million.
Impairments decreased by 40% to EUR 34 million in 2017 from EUR 57 million in 2016. The
decrease mainly relates to the release of EUR 20 million of impairments on a commercial real estate
exposure mentioned earlier. Excluding this release impairments decreased by 5% in 2017. The
impairment coverage ratio for our impaired corporate loan book amounts to 46%.
Corporate client offering's profit after tax increased to EUR 166 million in 2017. Excluding
EUR 47 million of net profit related to the commercial real estate exposure mentioned earlier, profit
after tax more than doubled to EUR 119 million compared to EUR 58 million in 2016.

Our operations in Germany continued to perform well as we continued to increase our market share
and generate new clients. This success was the result of our focused sector and sub-sector approach
combined with our product expertise. The origination level in Germany amounted to EUR 0.6 billion
by the end of the year, slightly below the EUR 0.7 billion in 2016. The closed leasing portfolio was

Commercial Real Estate Food, Agri, Retail & Health Industries & Manufacturing
Infrastructure & Renewables Offshore Energy Shipping & Intermodal
Telecom, Media & Technology & Services
On a sector level, the main developments in 2017 were the following:
■ Our portfolios in Offshore Energy and Shipping & Intermodal decreased by respectively 24% and
14% to a combined level of EUR 2.2 billion. In H1 2017, portfolios suffered from seasonality effects
and a negative USD forex effect. Business improved in the second half-year, due to stabilized oil
prices and a rise in contracting activity. Overcapacity in parts of the shipping sector remains a
challenge;
■ The portfolios continued to increase in our three corporate sectors: a) Industries & Manufacturing;
b) Food, Agri, Retail & Health and c) Telecom, Media, Technology & Services, which displayed a
combined portfolio increase of 6% to EUR 4.1 billion. We are continuing to diversify our portfolio
and further sharpening our focus on promising sub-sectors such as telecom, data centres, FinTech
and business software;
■ The Commercial Real Estate portfolio remained stable in 2017 at EUR 1.4 billion. As the transfor-
mation of the portfolio has progressed well, the sector now focuses on smaller deals for a larger
number of clients;
■ The Infrastructure & Renewables portfolio remained stable in 2017 EUR 1.6 billion. Growth is
being achieved in two sub-sectors: Digital Infrastructure and Renewable Energy. This growth is
being compensated by prepayments and our efforts to decrease the traditional infrastructure
portfolio that has longer maturities and generates lower returns.
We are not only proud of the strong results we achieved in almost all of our sector and product
categories, but also of the very high customer satisfaction level in 2017, several new activities
including participations in FinTech companies, and our agreement with the European Investment
Bank.
Agreement with European Investment Bank
In 2017, NIBC entered into a guarantee agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) that will
enable NIBC to provide up to EUR 500 million of loans to innovative mid-sized enterprises in the
Dutch and German markets. The Guarantee improves access to finance for companies with up to
3,000 employees and enables NIBC to offer larger amounts of senior debt financing. The operation is
supported by ‘InnovFin – EU Finance for Innovators’ and has the financial backing of the European
Union under Horizon 2020 Financial Instruments.

FinTech partnerships
The financial services landscape is evolving. NIBC would like to be a part of the disruption caused by
FinTech companies by taking strategic minority equity stakes in leading European FinTech companies,
enabling partnerships in various fields in order to capitalise on emerging FinTech solutions.
Ebury
At the end of May, NIBC acquired a strategic stake in the fast growing fintech company Ebury. Ebury
is one of the fastest-growing FinTech companies globally, employing over 500 staff, with offices in ten
European countries, focusing on corporate cross-border (FX) payments and growth lending. The
partnership between NIBC and Ebury will open up opportunities in cross-border trade for small and
mid-sized companies based in Europe. Ebury provides an innovative and unique platform for
payments, risk management, foreign exchange and trade financing.
FinLeap 
In the summer of 2017, NIBC took a minority stake in FinLeap, a ‘company builder’ specialising in
FinTechs. In the past three years, FinLeap has established itself as one of Europe’s leading FinTech
platforms, whose ecosystem brings together the most prominent players of the financial services
industry as well as investors and clients. Having launched multiple FinTech ventures so far, FinLeap is
already active in ten European countries. Its expertise in developing business models will support
NIBC in tailoring its client offering to today’s dynamic financial business environment.
Business developments
NIBC Markets
In 2016 we broadened our offering through NIBC Markets to include debt and equity capital
markets. Following the acquisition of SNS Securities, we have now fully integrated the Markets
activities into our organisation, an illustration of our capacity to integrate acquisitions in a thorough
and swift manner. We discontinued several activities, including Independent Asset Manager Services,
Specialised Asset Management and Third Party Execution, ensuring a smooth transition to new
service providers for 2,800 clients and allowing us to focus on the debt and equity capital markets
product offering.
NIBC Markets provides an offering in the Dutch mid-cap market at a time when capital markets are
becoming increasingly important to our clients. NIBC Markets extends the life cycle of our client
relationships and has the potential to strengthen our franchise in the years to come.
In August, NIBC Markets relocated from Amsterdam city centre to the Amsterdam Zuid-As business
district.
BEEQUIP
Launched in July 2016, the new leasing venture BEEQUIP saw significant volumes in the first one and
a half years of its existence. The leasing of new and used equipment proves to be a good fit with our
Industries & Manufacturing client base, broadening the scope of its activities to smaller-ticket financing
and offering our clients the possibility to lease their assets. BEEQUIP is a subsidiary of NIBC Holding
N.V.
In December, BEEQUIP was voted the 2017 New Hero at the end-of-year event of Dutch
employers' organisation VNO-NCW for the Rotterdam region. The New Hero prize is awarded
42 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
once a year to the most innovative entrepreneur of Rotterdam. At year end the lease portfolio of
BEEQUIP amounted to EUR 210 million compared to EUR 117 million in 2016
Client deals
In 2017, corporate client offering secured mandates for a large number of high-profile deals across its
markets, demonstrating its ability to provide tailor-made solutions swiftly, and at decisive moments for
its clients. These included the following examples:
Advicenne
In December 2017, NIBC, as Joint Global Coordinator, successfully completed the IPO of
pharmaceutical company Advicenne on Euronext Paris. Advicenne raised EUR 28 million, which will
enable the commercial launch of its lead drug candidate, ADV7103 in Europe for the treatment of
distal Renal Tubular Acidosis, a pediatric kidney disease, as well as the phase III clinical development in
the United States.
NIBC acted as joint global coordinator, joint lead manager and joint bookrunner in this landmark
transaction. With this transaction, our new Life Sciences team achieved an important milestone and
paved the way for many more capital market transactions to come. The success of this equity capital
markets transaction reflects NIBC´s approach of serving its clients with inventive tailor-made advisory
and financing solutions and contributes to our growth ambitions.
RED Company: new head office for ASICS
RED Company (REDC) is a Rotterdam based real estate developer. In 2017, REDC was awarded the
contract by ASICS to develop and construct its new European head office in Hoofddorp. ASICS is
the world famous sport and footwear corporation. The new office building has a state-of-the-art
design, is 100% sustainable and flexible in its use. NIBC provided a EUR 40 million construction
financing. NIBC was further involved in structuring the transaction and in raising the equity. Key in this
successful transaction was the swift execution and documentation.
Vopak Terminal Eemshaven
Vopak Terminal Eemshaven is a strategic oil storage terminal based in Eemshaven, developed in a
50/50 joint venture between Royal Vopak and NIBC European Infrastructure Fund I C.V. (NEIF). Since
commissioning in 2011, Vopak Terminal Eemshaven developed into a high quality asset with strong
contractual protections and exceptional operational performance. NIBC was mandated to assist
Royal Vopak and NEIF, as exclusive financial advisor, with the sale to large infrastructure manager
Whitehelm Capital. This flagship port transaction, a cooperation between M&A and I&M,
demonstrates NIBC’s cross department advisory skills in addition to NIBC’s investment strategy, being
the preferred partner for growth capital in support of mid-market corporates at decisive moments.
NPS of +64%
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) in 2017 of +64% (+37% for 2016) demonstrates the customer
satisfaction, of both new and existing clients, with NIBC’s ‘Think YES’ client approach. According to
received survey responses, customers value us most, compared to peers, for our knowledge, speed,
agility and account management. During 2017, our ‘Think YES’ client approach also compelled us to
simplify our documentation and product development.
Our NPS is based on responses given by 165 clients to our survey in the Netherlands, Germany and
the United Kingdom.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
RETAIL CLIENTS
2017 was a successful year for our retail client offering. We nearly doubled the mortgage loan
origination volume, which increased to nearly EUR 2 billion in 2017. We are gaining market share in
underserved segments with on-balance sheet products such as Buy-to-Let, while also originating
more mainstream mortgage loans for institutional investors.
Meanwhile in savings, our newly introduced quarterly savings product was well received by the
market, helping us to reduce our reliance on fixed-term savings and lower our funding costs. After
the product launch in April 2017, clients shifted an additional EUR 150 million in deposits to our line-
up of on-demand accounts.
Product offering
Our retail client offering business serves approximately 400,000 clients in the Netherlands, Germany
and Belgium through a wide range of quality mortgage, savings and brokerage products.
Mortgage loans
NIBC Direct mortgage loans are provided through partnerships with mortgage brokers across the
Netherlands. We offer mortgage loans from our own balance sheet and we partner with institutional
investors using our Orginate-to-Manage mandates. This dual-track strategy enables us to offer a full
product range – from short to long maturities – and also target clients in underserved segments with
tailored products such as Buy-to-Let and mortgage loans for the self-employed.
Retail savings
Under the NIBC Direct brand, we offer fairly-priced savings products to clients in the Netherlands,
Germany and Belgium, ranging from fully flexible, on-demand deposits, to term deposits of up to 10
years. These award-winning products are known for their straightforward client-centric features and
unambiguous terms and conditions.
In Germany, NIBC Direct provides products that enable clients to invest in equities as an alternative
to savings. Launched in 2011, NIBC Direct brokerage is a retail focused execution only specialist for
asset allocation for consumers. NIBC Direct brokerage focusses on traditional online-traders with
higher ticket sizes offered via German stock markets.

Trends in the world around us
In 2017, our strategic decisions were largely driven by the following trends in the world around us:
■ Competition from new market entrants in the Dutch mortgage market is putting additional
pressure on spreads for mainstream mortgage loans. We continue to target clients in underserved
segments with tailored products such as Buy-to-Let and mortgage loans for the self-employed;
■ The persistently low interest rates have led to increased demand for mortgage loans with
longer fixed interest terms (10-20 and even 30 years). Through our OTM mandates, we can tap
into the growth of this crowded and price-competitive segment with no credit risk for NIBC;
■ Driven by the low interest rates, savings clients are favouring on-demand accounts over
fixed-term deposits. To guarantee a stable funding base, we are launching new features that make
these on-demand savings stickier;
■ The combination of strong economic growth and record-low interest rates have accelerated the
recovery of the Dutch housing market. Transaction prices continue to rise and volumes have
fully recovered from lows after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. We are active in this growing market
through OTM and franchises such as Buy-to-Let, which taps into the increasing number of
investors in rented residential real estate.
Approach and strategy in the market
Operating under the NIBC Direct brand, we help clients realise their financial goals by offering
products that are accessible, easy to understand and fairly priced. Below, we dig deeper into the
strategy and market approach of our mortgage and retail savings businesses.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 45
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Mortgage loans
We offer mortgage loans from our own balance sheet and we partner with institutional investors
using our OTM mandates. This dual-track strategy enables us to offer a full product range – from
short to long maturities – and also target clients in underserved segments with tailored products such
as Buy-to-Let, mortgage loans for the self-employed and the negative equity mortgage.
The negative equity mortgage enables clients - in case sales proceeds of their house are below the
previous mortgage loan - to finance this negative balance. The negative equity mortgage provides
financing above a LTV of 100% (up to a maximum of 115%), however, the debt-to-income ratio
criteria remain the same compared to a ‘standard’ mortgage loan.
With on-balance sheet mortgage loan products, we prioritise margin over volume by focusing on
higher-yielding segments where we can make a difference for our clients. A good example is the
mortgage loan for self-employed clients with a track record of less than three years, which we
launched in 2016.
At the same time, the OTM business supports our strategy in many ways. We enhance income
diversification by adding the fee-generating OTM business line, we create the flexibility to switch back
and forth between on-balance sheet origination and OTM depending on market circumstances and
we become a more relevant partner to brokers by supplying a full product range from niche
solutions to long interest fixed terms.
In addition, we differentiate ourselves in the market through pricing and product features. For
instance, we were the first to introduce automatic reduction of the mortgage rate during interest
fixed term due to redemption.
Retail savings
The broad range of savings products in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium provides funding
stability and flexibility to respond if market conditions change. Over the past few years, we have been
focusing more on instant-access deposits by reducing the more expensive fixed-term savings, which
has helped to diversify our funding sources and to lower costs.
Developments and performance
2017 was a successful year for the retail client offering business. Since we returned to the mortgage
market in 2013, our business has undergone a profound transformation. We have grown our existing
mortgage and savings businesses and launched successful new franchises, leaving us with a diversified
portfolio that perfectly supports our differentiated approach to the market well into the future.
Improving the customer experience
The offering in both mortgage loans and savings is underpinned by a comprehensive digital strategy,
which allows us to operate more efficiently while providing a client focussed experience to the
customers. In 2017 we improved the functionality of the mortgage portal.
These and other efforts clearly translated into higher customer satisfaction, as evidenced by a NIBC
Direct Customer Survey score of 7.9 in 2017, compared with 7.6 in 2016.
Financial performance
Operating income from retail clients increased 14% to EUR 130 million, as the growth of the
mortgage loan portfolio and lower funding costs led to increased net interest income.
46 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Net fee and commission income of nearly EUR 4 million is related to income from the OTM
mandate launched in 2016.
Operating expenses increased by EUR 6 million (+11%) to EUR 63 million, which nearly fully relates
to the increase by EUR 5 million of external servicing expenses, of which EUR 2 million were
expenses for the transition of a part of the Mortgage Loan portfolio to another service provider
(which will lead to more efficiency and lower servicing expenses in the future) and EUR 3 million for
the substantially higher origination level of mortgage loans, including the Originate-to-Manage offering;
Retail clients net profit increased by 19% to EUR 50 million.

Mortgage loans
Mortgage loan origination volumes reached EUR 1.9 billion in 2017 (2016: EUR 1.1 billion) of which
EUR 0.3 billion was Buy-to-Let and EUR 0.7 billion related to an OTM mandate for an institutional
investor. After pre- and repayments, the total mortgage loan portfolio for own book increased by
more than 3% in 2017 from EUR 8.8 billion at year-end 2016 to EUR 9.1 billion at year-end 2017, of
which 2% from the purchase of a portfolio owner-occupied mortgage loans of EUR 0.2 billion.
In line with the improving Dutch housing market and economic recovery, the mortgage loan portfolio
has shown a further improvement in credit quality. In 2017, we managed to reduce the loss rates to
pre-crisis levels. Both the defaulted and the non-performing exposure in the Mortgage Loan portfolio
decreased by 17% in 2017 to a level of 0.46%

The record growth in the mortgage loan origination volume shows that the dual-track strategy
continues to pay off. Since securing our first mandate in 2016, we have attracted nearly EUR 2 billion
in OTM commitments with related assets under management increasing to EUR 0.7 billion, which
provides a great runway for growth in this asset class.
OTM allows us to diversify the income base by adding fee revenue and helps to become a more
relevant partner to mortgage brokers because we offer a wide product range – from 1 year to 30
year maturities. As a result, our partner network expanded at the end of 2017, providing ample
opportunity to keep growing our share of the Dutch mortgage market in the years to come.
Meanwhile, we continued to focus on profitable sub-sectors that are underserved, such as Buy-to-
Let. Growth in Buy-to-Let continued at attractive margins, pushing the portfolio up to
EUR 617 million from EUR 371 million at the end of 2016. Due to the increasing numbers of
investors investing in rented residential real estate, Buy-to-Let has become an important part of our
overall mortgage loan offering. We clearly focus on those clients that aim for tenants that do not rent
for a short stay and our standard conditions include that the premises are not to be used for short
stay rental (through for example Air B&B).
Savings
Total client savings decreased by 4% to EUR 9.3 billion at the end of 2017, coming from
EUR 9.7 billion at year-end 2016. Our continued efforts to increase the share of on-demand deposits
with flexible rates versus more expensive fixed-term savings resulted in a controlled net outflow of
EUR 0.4 billion in the year. On 31 December, on-demand deposits accounted for 58% of total client
savings, up from 56% in 2016 and 45% in 2015.

The newly introduced quarterly savings product was well received by clients. The product, which was
launched in April 2017 and provide compensation for those who have not withdrawn their on-
demand savings during the quarter, attracted EUR 150 million in additional client deposits in the year.
The product provides clients with the opportunity to earn higher interest without giving up any
flexibility, which is exactly what they want in this low-interest environment.
Brokerage
Launched in 2011 in Germany, NIBC Direct brokerage is a retail focused execution only specialist for
asset allocation for consumers. NIBC Direct brokerage focuses on traditional online traders with
higher ticket sizes offered via German stock markets. This activity continued to show a positive
development. Assets under management increased 18% in 2017 to EUR 180 million. The number of
accounts increased by 4% to around 6,500.
TREASURY AND GROUP FUNCTIONS
Treasury and Group Functions includes the Treasury function, Asset and Liability Management (ALM),
Risk Management and the bank's Corporate Centre which includes HR & Corporate
Communications, Internal Audit, Legal, Compliance, Sustainability, Operations & Facilities, Technology,
and Finance & Tax and Strategy & Development.
In Treasury, focus was on the various funding transactions that were successfully executed during the
year, including a benchmark EUR 500 million senior unsecured transaction and issuance of
EUR 200 million AT1 subordinated securities to further optimise NIBC’s capital structure. In addition,
Treasury spent considerable time and effort on regulatory developments that impact the bank’s
funding programmes as well as other Treasury activities. MiFID II in particular required significant
resources to meet the 3 January 2018 compliance deadline. 
NIBC has an ambitious project calendar. Apart from supporting all regular processes, the Group
Functions coordinate and contribute to the realisation of these projects. Examples of the projects
undertaken are the following:
■ With respect to the IT environment the focus in 2017 was on strengthening the current
infrastructure, improvements of business platforms, including phasing out of some legacy systems,
executing regulatory projects such as MIFID II and IFRS 9 and on an IT transition programme
started in H2 2016. In 2016 we entered into an outsourcing contract with a third party. The
outsourcing comprised of a new framework for IT delivery, including a substantial part of the IT
infrastructure, IT service desk and management of the IT infrastructure. In Q4 2017 it was decided
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 49
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
to terminate this contract and to retransition the IT organisation. Any outsourcing to this third
party will be rolled back early 2018, after which new opportunities to achieve the intended goals
will be evaluated. We believe that our existing stand alone IT platform is sustainable for current
operations;
■ An important milestone was reached in May 2017 with the go-live of NIBC’s new Treasury back
office system. With this achievement, many internal processes were improved or simplified, as the
new system enables more straight-through processing and better integration with front
office functionality;
■ As of 3 January 2018 NIBC is MiFID II-compliant. The requirements of this regulation have a
significant impact on transaction processes of Treasury and NIBC Markets;
■ The initial application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 required development of models, review and
analysis of the bank’s positions and adjustment of administrative processes. A multidisciplinary team
has worked on the different elements to ensure operational readiness and will continue to work
on further refinement and improvement of all related processes;
■ To improve and modernise NIBC’s payment processes, Operations and IT are executing a
payment roadmap. This roadmap aims to replace legacy infrastructure with up-to-date solutions. In
2017, the IT footprint was reduced via outsourcing. A new, future proof payments hub is in
preparation and will be implemented in 2018;
■ In 2017, NIBC has reviewed its interest rate hedging strategy. A team involving Treasury, ALM,
Operations, Finance and IT has been designing a more efficient hedging strategy, which is also
more in line with common market practice. The bank has started to adjust its book structure and
hedging positions. Target state is to manage all interest rate risks centrally, from where the net
position will be hedged externally;
■ To underpin the importance of data management and data quality, NIBC has formalised data
management by including the associated responsibilities in its delegation model. With this
governance in place, the organisation will use central targets and frameworks to define and
execute the next steps in data management; 
■ A project team is preparing NIBC for the new AnaCredit reporting requirements. The first tests
have been concluded successfully, and preparations are on going to ensure operational readiness.
As of September 2018, financial institutions will have to report the new statistical datasets.
Financial performance
The net result after tax of the segment Treasury and Group Functions, as reported in note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Report, equals a net loss of EUR 4 million. The loss is mainly driven by the
reorganisation costs of NIBC Markets and the additional costs related to the transition of NIBC’s IT
organisation.

In 2017, our total headcount decreased to 689 employees, from 716 in 2016. This decrease mainly
relates to the reorganisation of the IT department and the discontinuation of the NIBC Markets
Vermogensbeheer Services, including supporting activities.

Employee engagement
Our aim is to lead by example by continuously improving and safeguarding our levels of employee
engagement. We believe that our continued good NPS from corporate clients and client satisfaction
of the retail offering are a result of having people that are highly engaged.
In 2017, we selected a new supplier for the Employee Engagement Survey, with a different
methodology than our previous supplier. We decided to start a more extensive engagement survey
among our employees in order to better understand the results. This more extensive survey will be
conducted for the first time in the summer of 2018.
Development
To compete effectively in our industry, we must develop ourselves at a faster pace and to a higher
standard than many of our (larger) peers. Competition is tough within the financial services industry
as a whole and in the labour market the banking sector is still perceived as less attractive than before
2008. But, as a mid-sized bank, we have a, in some ways, more compelling offer for employees than
our larger peers; one in which they will have greater responsibilities, influence and impact from the

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
start. Our ‘Think YES’ campaigns have helped positioning NIBC in the highly competitive labour
market.
In 2017, we spent over EUR 2,300 per employee on training and educational programmes. This is
close to the top quartile when benchmarked with financial services, and close to the top decile
compared to general industries. These investments increase the professional capabilities and
competences of our people.
NIBC Introduction Program
The NIBC Introduction Program was organised on a regular basis in 2017 to enhance the onboarding
of new employees. Besides presentations on the strategy of the bank and on various parts of
organisation, special attention was paid to the importance of our corporate values, the NIBC3. All
new employees have taken the Bankers’ Oath.
NIBC Academy
We have a solid training and learning offering in the NIBC Academy, our virtual centre for continuous
training and learning, enabling us to offer development in a more customised and effective way. It ran
a total of 25 modular courses in 2017. The Academy's approach is to empower employees to take
responsibility for their own development, through a range of channels, including on-demand online
workshops and classroom courses. Staff can also create their own learning initiatives.
Besides developing professional skills we increasingly focus on skills that make our staff more inventive
and entrepreneurial. Our newest program, Dare2Develop, is a clear example. This invitation-only
program is geared to our talented young professionals at associate and vice-president level. The
program is developed in close cooperation with the participants and enhances personal effectiveness
in influencing, consulting, negotiation and innovation. The connection with NIBC’s strategy is made by
deep dive cases and the active involvement of senior management through mentoring and coaching.
Other examples of NIBC's efforts to support its staff to continuously develop are the following:
■ To build on our basic financial and lending skills, in 2017 we offered a number of professional
training courses such as Financial & Cashflow Analysis and a Fitch Credit Course.
■ We continue to support new ways of working through a high number of IT and application related
courses that are available to all personnel.
■ The Management Development Programme and ‘Influencing with Impact’ training courses have
continued to help us develop employees' personal and management skills.
■ A total of 21 participants completed our dedicated Talent Programme in 2017. This Talent
Programme for young bankers has been designed to appeal to a new generation of bankers. One
of the challenge projects conducted in the Programme delivered a renewed set-up, which will start
to run in January 2018. The modular and flexible approach of this renewed set-up is even more
tailored to the needs and demands of the new generation.
Recruitment and Young NIBC
Recruitment efforts have continued to include engagement with selected student associations, for
which we organised several in-house days and attended various recruitment events. By organising an
event for recent interns and their friends we were able to attract and hire new talents who match
our ambitions and culture.
At the same time, we have become significantly more inventive in our other recruitment efforts and
are using new and more dynamic channels, such as gamification, social media and other online
52 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
platforms. These can provide better engagement prospects for diverse talent and help to convey
what working at NIBC is really like.
Young NIBC
The Young NIBC network is focused on connecting younger NIBC staff to each other and the bank.
Young NIBC identifies their needs and facilitates matching events, with a focus on personal
development, learning about NIBC’s organisation and culture and creating a professional network.
One of the Young NIBC activities in 2017 was a visit to a client in Madrid, a fintech company. Thirty
of our young colleagues learned about their way-of-working and how to apply this at NIBC.
Social responsibility is highly valued in Young NIBC. In 2017, eight young colleagues were given the
opportunity to participate in the Face-the-Future Programme, directed to connect refugees in The
Netherlands (or ‘newcomers’) to corporate employees. Moreover, Young NIBC organised the NIBC
Challenge which entailed 25 young colleagues and the Voedselbank Haaglanden (Food Bank
Haaglanden), working together to find a solution for optimising cash flows at the food bank.
Banking on trust
At NIBC we are mindful of our responsibility towards helping build and maintain trust in the financial
services industry. We believe trust is the foundation on which our sector must be based, and we have
consistently looked to make it the basis of our own company’s culture. To support this aim, we have
continued to run our Banking on Trust programme and made concerted efforts through our focus
on sustainable culture and behaviours.
During the year, we continued the Compliance & Integrity awareness programme that is based on
our revised Code of Conduct, and reflects the most up-to-date standards in our industry. This
dedicated programme has continued to raise employees’ awareness about our Compliance &
Integrity policy framework for dealing with integrity- related matters, e.g. through a mandatory Code
of Conduct/Compliance e-learning. Compliance & Integrity training is also obligatory for all new
employees when they join NIBC.
Promoting diversity
We believe that diversity is critical to our ability to succeed and achieve sustainable success. We are
committed to creating a stimulating work environment for people from all backgrounds, that is open
to different ways of thinking. In 2017, we continued to pay close attention to all elements of our
diversity goals, e.g. increasing inclusiveness, balancing age distribution, improving gender diversity and
retaining and valueing differences in background.
Diversity across age segments showed balance in 2017. 18% of our employees were under 30 years
of age and 23% of employees were age 50 or older.
The gender diversity for our organisation increased to 31% female staff (2016: 27%). Senior
management reported an increase in gender diversity to 13% (2016: 9%). Although it may be too
early to draw firm conclusions, we think this development shows the pay-off of our structural
attention and efforts concerning gender diversity.
In 2016, we launched the Diversity Committee which is tasked with researching our current
behaviours and recommending ways to achieve a more inclusive environment at NIBC. We took
steps to increase diversity across the company through our recruitment processes. And diversity in
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 53
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
general and the male-female balance specifically, are also explicitly taken into account in our talent
programmes and performance management. To address gender imbalances specifically, we have
introduced engagements aimed at helping to retain and further develop talented female employees.
Increasing diversity among senior managers was a key focus area in 2017. Our objective is at least
one third of our Supervisory Board and Managing Board members to be female. NIBC's new
Executive Committee, which became effective on 1 January 2017, meets this objective. NIBC is
aware that it falls short of this goal with respect to the Supervisory Board and Managing Board (one
woman on a total of eight and nil on a total of three, respectively) and the overall senior positions
(director level and higher), although here the percentage increased to 12% (from 9% in 2016).
NIBC will continue to address this topic as high-priority. In the case of a vacancy in the Managing
Board or the Supervisory Board, the regular policy is applied in which we ask the executive search to
shortlist at least 50% female candidates.
Pensions and benefits
Revisions in previous years have allowed us to operate a modern set of employee benefits, which are
flexible and better aligned to the realities of our business. An important aspect was the switch to a
discretionary approach to compensation and benefits, which takes into account a range of
considerations, including KPIs and country-wide benchmarks. This has enabled us to continue
rewarding our talented staff well and to retain them.
Similarly, in 2014 we revised our pension plan to a collective-defined contribution (CDC) scheme
(applicable as of 2015) for salaries up to EUR 103,317, from a defined benefit (DB) pension plan
applicable in the years before 2015. For the employer, the main benefit is that pension costs have
become predictable by this revision.
Health and safety
A healthy workforce is a key element in achieving the Company's objective. We executed a range of
programmes and initiatives in 2017, to enhance our people’s well-being.
We offered our employees a preventive health check, in which 175 colleagues participated. 62
collleagues made use of the free flu vaccinations that was offered to our staff.
We continued to promote a good work-life balance and to incorporate new ways to increase
flexibility in how we work. In 2017, we successfully executed the recommendations of the 2016 Risk
Assessment and Evaluation of our working conditions. This assessment, conducted by a certified third
party, concluded that NIBC is generally well in control regarding safety, health and well-being.
With the health and safety programmes and initiatives, NIBC has contributed in a positive way to the
low absenteeism rate of 2.2% in 2017.
Works Council
NIBC’s Works’ Council (Council) represents the interests of all staff based in the Netherlands. It
currently has 11 members from all departments and levels across the bank. As the voice of the
employees, the Council regularly meets with the members of the Managing Board and HR team in
both formal and informal settings. Twice a year, it meets with members of the Supervisory Board.
54 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Since 2014 NIBC has opted not to be part of the collective labour agreement for banking institutions
in the Netherlands. Therefore, the Council - as the representative of all NIBC’s employees on the
payroll in The Netherlands - became senior management’s direct interlocutor for negotiations in this
important area. The negotiations have led to revisions in our employee benefit scheme in 2017.
The Council advised on six subjects, including the reorganisation of NIBC Markets and the
reappointment of Managing Board members. Furthermore, the Council gave its approval to seven
subjects, including changes to the working conditions of the Retail Call Center (‘Klant Contact
Center’), changes to the Whistle Blowing Policy and multiple changes to the NIBC Pension Fund
agreements and the Staff Manual.
Given the challenges facing NIBC and the banking sector, the Council remains focused on the
employability of NIBC’s staff and on NIBC’s competitive position as an attractive employer. This was
reflected in the Council’s points of view regarding reorganisations, diversity, labour agreements, and
pension agreements. In 2017, the Council successfully discussed and negotiated an employability
policy with an initial set of instruments, such as an individual additional development budget, to
support and stimulate employability for NIBC’s employees.
SUSTAINABILITY
At NIBC, we believe it is our responsibility to be a sustainable business for the benefit of future
generations. We are convinced that as a business that takes its social and environmental
responsibilities seriously, we are better able to manage our risks and tap promising opportunities in
our markets.
We want to ensure that the services we provide are responsible and sustainable. Additionally, as a
financial services provider, we are well aware of the enormous responsibility we have in helping to
build and maintain trust in our industry.
Our day-to-day business decisions and interactions with clients are guided by established principles
and policies set out in our Code of Conduct, Business Principles, Corporate Values, and Compliance
Framework and Sustainability Framework. You can find these documents on our website. Since 2010,
we have steadily developed our Sustainability agenda in close consultation with our stakeholders. Our
governance revolves around a system of checks and balances that ensures stakeholders are also part
of our decision-making processes.
Core standards
We manage the sustainability impact of our financings through our Sustainability Framework, which
can be found in the Sustainability section on our website. This Sustainability Framework describes
governance, implementation, and the roles and responsibilities within our organisation in regard to
sustainability risks. NIBC defines sustainability risks to include environmental, climate, social, human
rights, and governance risks.
We ensure sustainability due diligence is performed on all clients and transactions. The Framework
and its policies are based on internationally recognised conventions and standards. Our approach to
certain sectors and activities is further elaborated in our sustainability sector policies. These standards
provide the overarching principles and standards that form the basis for the E&S (Environmental &
Social ) sustainability framework used by NIBC to consider its involvement with its clients. You can
find these sector policies on our website.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 55
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In 2017, we revised and updated all our policy documents. We rechecked all our guidelines and
conventions to be completely sure we are in compliance with international and national conventions,
protocols and codes.
We also updated our Code of Conduct which underpins our purpose and corporate values. It guides
us in the way we work at NIBC. Key themes are: doing the right thing, follow the letter and the spirit
of rules and doing what we say. You can find the Code of Conduct on our website.
UN Global Compact
In 2017 NIBC reconfirmed its support to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact with respect
to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. These principles support the Sustainable
Development Goals, providing an ethical and business framework to help companies generate value
while reinforcing essential human values. This reconfirmation follows our original commitment from
December 2010 and our annual ongoing commitment to advance the principles since that time.
Equator Principles
NIBC is also one of 92 financial institutions in 37 countries worldwide which have officially adopted
the Equator Principles. The Equator Principles are a risk management framework for determining,
assessing and managing environmental and social (E&S) risk in project finance transactions. NIBC has
implemented the EPs in our sustainability policies and due diligence process for financing projects and
will not provide Project Finance or Project-Related Corporate Loans to projects where the client will
not, or is unable to, comply with the EPs. In 2017, seven transactions financed by NIBC were closed
which qualified under these guidelines.
How we manage sustainability
Our governance revolves around a system of checks and balances which ensures stakeholder views
are taken into account in our decision-making processes. NIBC's Managing Board is ultimately
responsible for all Sustainability matters.
ExCo members discuss and advise on sustainability strategy, targets, planning and budget. The ExCo is
also responsible for policies that impact NIBC’s culture and ethics, such as the Code of Conduct.
Updates to the sustainability framework and underlying policies are reviewed and approved by
NIBC’s Risk Management Committee.
Responsibility for overseeing NIBC's sustainability agenda is delegated to our Sustainability Officer but
is primarily managed by and embedded in each business unit. Processes, roles and responsibilities are
defined to manage sustainability and take a precautionary approach.
Sustainability Officer
The NIBC Sustainability agenda is overseen by a dedicated sustainability team, led by a dedicated
fulltime Senior Sustainability Officer who is responsible for catalysing sustainability and corporate
social responsibility within the organisation.
The sustainability team is responsible for the set-up and implementation of the sustainability strategy,
including targets, planning and budget. It is up-to-date on all sustainability developments and is
responsible for engaging with our external stakeholders. The team meets regularly with each business
unit to discuss progress and evaluate activities. On a quarterly basis, it also reports on figures and
progress to the Managing Board.
56 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The NIBC Sustainability agenda is led by a dedicated fulltime Senior Sustainability Officer who is
responsible for catalysing sustainability and corporate social responsibility within the organisation.
The Officer is responsible for the set-up and implementation of the sustainability strategy, including
targets, planning and budget. It is up-to-date on all sustainability developments and is responsible for
engaging with our external stakeholders. The Officer meets regularly with each business unit to
discuss progress and evaluate activities. Sustainability matters are monitored and reported periodically
to the ExCo and the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC), a subcommittee of NIBC's
Supervisory Board.
Business units
NIBC’s Sustainability agenda is aligned to our business strategy, and different departments are
responsible for managing sustainability as part of their activities. For example, business teams apply
the Sustainability Framework in their client interactions, Facilities & Services manages NIBC’s energy
efficiency programme, and Human Resources is responsible for sustainability in our human resource
activities.
We ensure sustainability due diligence is performed on all corporate clients and transactions. New
products and significant changes to existing products are assessed for any potential human rights and
environmental impacts. Suppliers are required to meet our human rights, environment and
anticorruption standards and are evaluated as part of our know your supplier process.
In addition to our headquarters in The Hague, our offices in Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam have
a Sustainability representative who acts as a liaison for the sustainability team. The representatives
help inform local staff on our sustainability policies and activities and report back on any relevant local
sustainability initiatives or issues to head office. To find out more about our sustainability strategy and
how it is managed, please visit our website.
Non-financial reporting
The NIBC Annual Report 2017 has been drafted in accordance with the Dutch Decree disclosure of
non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiële informatie), which came into effect on
24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-Financial Reporting
Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330).
This Report also applies the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Our GRI content index and a
Materiality Assessment can be found on the NIBC Annual Report website. Additional non-financial
information and disclosures are published in the sustainability section of our website.
Environment and natural capital
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity are signs of unprecedented pressure on the
environment and the planet’s ecological limits. NIBC is committed to reducing negative impacts on
the environment in our business activities and helping clients in their transition towards more
responsible practices.
NIBC is carbon neutral with regards to direct emissions from its own operations. Since 2010, we have
measured our direct emissions, realised substantial reductions and compensated for any remaining
direct emissions. 100% of electricity powering NIBC's facilities is sourced from renewable energy. We
manage our direct impact on the environment through an environmental sustainability programme.
NIBC Markets was integrated into this program during 2017.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 57
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In 2017 a third party energy audit was performed for our headquarters in The Hague. The outcome
confirmed the progress we have made to date and will help to further optimise energy efficiency
through future maintenance and refurbishments. For more information about our environmental
footprint and sustainable activities and performance in 2017, please visit our website.
NIBC supports its clients to achieve their transition towards more sustainable practices. The main
environmental risk for NIBC is climate risk as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from traditional
business sectors like Shipping and Offshore Energy.
During 2017, no severe environmental incidents related to NIBC’s financings, own operations, or
supply chain were reported. We mitigate potential risks through client and transaction due diligence,
stakeholder engagement and by supporting companies in their transition toward more responsible
business. For example, NIBC is supporting Offshore Energy services companies pursue emerging
opportunities in renewables. By doing so we are helping companies to diversify their business,
accelerate the transition towards a low carbon future and protect jobs.
Climate Bond Certified green loan
In January, NIBC announced that it successfully arranged Europe’s very first climate bond certified 20-
year green loan. The green loan was for German client MEP Werke and Dutch investor Delta Lloyd
Asset Management. This innovative transaction meets the Climate Bonds Standards v2.0 and is
certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). MEP Werke is one of Germany’s leading decentralised
energy providers and specialises in leasing solar power systems which provide affordable renewable
energy to German residential homeowners.
Responsible Ship Recycling Standards
NIBC is one of three founding members of the Responsible Ship Recycling Standards (RSRS), an
initiative that aims to promote more responsible practices in the industry, particularly regarding
environmental and human rights impacts. The Standards promote the use of inventories for
hazardous materials and ensure responsible ship recycling at end of life.
Importantly, NIBC’s shipping clients embraced this approach and have led its implementation. Several
clients have taken further steps beyond the vessels financed by NIBC and have committed to this
approach across their entire fleet. Additional leading shipping financiers have joined RSRS during
2017. The initiative was publicly launched in June at Nor Shipping, a leading shipping industry event.
Civil society organisations have endorsed the initiative and are actively engaged in RSRS. This initiative
is the first of its kind in the sector and is a example of how NIBC is working with clients and other
stakeholders to address potential environmental and human rights risks in global value chains.
Social aspects
NIBC believes that respect for human rights is a basic responsibility; towards our own employees, but
also towards those people who are affected indirectly by our actions. NIBC endorses human rights as
formulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (‘Ruggie framework’) and UN Principles for
Business and Human Rights.
Respecting people and their human rights is a foundation of NIBC’s Code of Conduct which
underpins our corporate values. Human rights due diligence is integrated into our sustainability due
diligence and monitoring processes for financings and investments to identify and manage potential
human rights risks.
58 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
During 2017 no severe human rights incidents related to NIBC’s financings, own operations, and
supply chain were reported. The main salient human rights risks for NIBC are labour conditions and
worker safety in corporate client supply chains. NIBC mitigates these through stakeholder
engagement, client and transaction due diligence and by raising awareness. Transparency into supply
chains has proven to be a challenge for mid-market businesses but is gradually improving.
IMVO agreement for the Dutch banking sector
In December 2016, NIBC signed the IMVO agreement for the Dutch banking sector. The initiative
aims to improve human rights practices related to project and corporate financings and is guided by
the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises and UN Guiding Principles for Business and
Human Rights. We use the IMVO platform to share knowledge and experience with civil society
organisations, authorities, clients, and financial sector peers. During 2017, NIBC actively participating
in working groups focused on knowledge sharing and enabling effective grievance and remedy
mechanisms. Results from the working groups are expected to be published during 2018.
Supporting vulnerable clients
NIBC has for many years had in place an extensive support programme for mortgage clients whose
payments are in arrears. NIBC Special Servicing Mortgages sets up debt repayment schemes together
with these clients. If the scheme fails or cannot be implemented, we discuss the options for
restructuring the loan with the client. We call in a mortgage advisor to help us assess whether the
interest rate could be lowered by such actions as interest rate averaging or mobilising the client's
savings or investments to enable early redemption of part of the loan. And if a mortgage client is
unable to repay their debt due to unemployment, we can call in a job coach.
In 2017 NIBC Special Servicing Mortgages focused its efforts on further developing this approach.
Our new business coaching programme for motivated self-employed entrepreneurs with payment
problems is unique in the Netherlands. Some self-employed entrepreneurs are highly qualified
professionals who lack expertise in marketing or administrative matters. The coach provides them
with the help they need to permanently boost their income.
Special Servicing Mortgages has also implemented a new client-first way of working. Mortgage clients
whose payments are in arrears are immediately assigned to a single point of contact who deals with
their case – a client-friendly approach that speeds up the process of finding solutions. We also try to
observe at an early stage that clients might run into problems, for example by encouraging clients to
report to us in advance that they might be laid off soon.
To prevent future payment problems, we proactively review redemption-free mortgage loans,
particularly when clients are a bit older or their mortgage interest tax relief will soon expire. In such
cases, we inform the client about the imminent change in their financial situation and in some cases sit
down with them to draw up a plan that will facilitate repayment of the loan.
These and other measures have in 2017 resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of long-term
cases handled by Special Servicing Mortgages.
Client privacy & data security
When confidential or private information belongs to NIBC or a client, we handle it with the utmost
care. Cybercrime is a risk for NIBC as well as for all of our financial sector peers. In 2017 we carried
out a large number of tests, continuously assessing our data protections, as part of our efforts to
strengthen NIBC's cybersecurity.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 59
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
We do not leave such information unattended and we have policies such as a clear desk policy,
information security policies, and additional security controls. Staff may not use non-secure
communication channels or storage devices for sensitive or confidential information. Third parties
may not use our equipment, software or databases unless authorised. Our approach is detailed in our
Corporate Information Security Policy and our Data Protection Policy. We have a Record Keeping Policy in
place to ensure we adhere to legal requirements with respect to data protection. During 2017, there
were no complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data, nor any
reportable leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data.
Human capital
NIBC invests significantly in developing its people personally and professionally, and providing a
stimulating work environment that values diversity and treats everyone with respect. NIBC has zero
tolerance for all forms of discrimination with respect to employment and occupation and have
systems in place to actively manage this.
We adhere to national employment legislation in the countries in which we are active and comply
with best practices. Respecting and protecting human rights and embracing diversity are embedded in
our Code of Conduct. To find out more about our human resources agenda please refer to the ‘Our
People’ chapter in this Annual Report.
In this light, we are very pleased that our Information Technology Director (CIO) Artie Debidien won
the Ethnic Business Woman Award (in the Managers category) in late 2017. These awards were
introduced by Stichting EZVN, a foundation promoting ethnical business women in the Netherlands.
The foundation was set up in 2004 to create a platform for talented female business people with an
ethnical background.
Anti-corruption and bribery measures
In 2017, NIBC fully revised its whistleblowing policy and procedure. Later that year, NIBC updated
and relaunched its corporate Code of Conduct. All staff received mandatory training on the updated
Code as well as on related compliance policies such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and
anti-bribery. These updates demonstrate NIBC’s ongoing commitment towards good corporate
governance and to uphold the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact.
In line with our commitment to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, NIBC does not
accept or tolerate any instance of bribery, corruption or fraud. Any NIBC employee found giving or
accepting bribes, or committing any other acts of corruption, will face disciplinary action. NIBC also
does not want to engage with clients who have consistently violated the principles of the UN Global
Compact and do not provide any level of commitment to improve.\

Anti-fraud
Our anti-fraud framework emphasises prevention and timely detection. All staff are responsible for
the prevention, detection and deterrence of fraud. We familiarise ourselves with the types of
improprieties that might occur within our area of responsibility, and are alert to any indication of
irregularity. We always report actual or suspected fraud or misconduct, after which a special
investigation is launched, if appropriate. If fraud is established, action will be taken against violators.
During 2017 no such irregularities were reported.
Tax compliance
NIBC proactively communicates with tax authorities, evidenced by its ongoing agreement on
horizontal supervision with the Dutch tax authorities. We consider tax risk in our decision making
with regard to clients, transactions and investments. Our aim is to avoid possible risks of tax base
erosion and profit-shifting activities. In November, NIBC published a Tax Position Statement on our
website which summarises our approach.
We have established and implemented a Tax Control Framework (TCF) that includes an administrative
organisation, procedures and internal controls, to meet tax compliance requirements. Our TCF is
reviewed periodically in order to keep it up-to-date and in line with all relevant developments in rules
and regulations, changes within the organisation and societal demands. We do not engage in
transactions without economic substance or which are exclusively aimed at safekeeping or realising
tax benefits for ourselves or our clients.
Innovation lab
The Innovation Lab encourages employees to support the evolution to an even more inventive,
entrepreneurial and client-oriented bank. NIBC started the Innovation Lab in January 2016.
In 2017 the focus of the Innovation Lab was on inspiring, connecting with partners and
experimenting. We did this by organising several events, among which were 'Inspiration Mondays'.
Every month we hosted sessions in The Hague with inspiring guests from outside the bank,
specialised in artificial intelligence, fintech, the energy transition, data security and other important
developments and trends for NIBC and its clients. During 2017 the Inspiring Mondays were attended
by 80 to 90 employees on average.
In addition to the Inspiring Mondays, the Innovation Lab organised special workshops aimed at
experimenting and innovation. These workshops are empowering our staff to address inefficiencies
and find solutions. Employees also frequently engaged with start-up incubators, acting as coaches and
mentors to young entrepreneurs during the year.
Over the past two years, the Innovation Lab has resulted in several business opportunities for NIBC
as well as increased awareness by employees in regard to business and societal developments.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We recognise our responsibilities towards stakeholders, and look to consider their interests in our
day-to-day decisions and activities. Engaging with stakeholders in a proactive way and on a continuous
basis is central to our strategy and ambition to achieve sustainable growth. To ensure our long-term
success, we acknowledge the need to strike a careful balance between the interests of all our
stakeholders.

carried out twice a year. This exercise provides critical clarity on the matters most important to our
stakeholders, and offers valuable insights into how we should allocate our resources. The outcome of
this process is described in this chapter.
As part of this process, we have assessed the different areas of the value we create and the capital
we control. We did this not only in terms of our products and services to our clients, but also in
terms of the value we deliver to those who invest in us and provide funding.
We have encapsulated the results into a ‘value flow’ diagram which provides clarity into our value
creation model. While a simplified view, it reflects our client-first business agenda, our business
principles which will enable our future financial and non-financial performance.

Materiality analysis 2017
In 2017, our stakeholder consultation was performed across seven stakeholder groups representing
our clients, investors, regulators, civil society and employees. Stakeholder representatives were asked
to rank each material topic on a scale of 1 to10 (1 = least important; 10 = most important).
We used this opportunity to ask for more specific feedback in regard to areas such as climate risk,
diversity, data security and modern slavery. They were also invited to add material topics of their
own. The location of each topic within the graph represents the result of their response.

IMPACT OF NIBC
Themes:  Client Focus The world around us Culture & integrity Employee expertise
The three most important aspects for stakeholders were client satisfaction, product responsibility and
stakeholder engagement. Client satisfaction was seen by stakeholders as the most material aspect.
They believe that high client satisfaction is an indicator of the strength of our franchise.
Product responsibility and stakeholder engagement are also very important and areas of strength for
NIBC. Our online platform and clear terms and conditions in retail banking were appreciated by
clients. Stakeholders appreciated the agility and sector expertise in NIBC's corporate offering.
Data security and privacy significantly increased in importance to stakeholders, likely due to increased
public awareness of cyber incidents during the year. Retail and corporate clients mentioned that they
need to have confidence that their information is protected. At the same time regulatory
requirements (PSD2) are requiring increased external access to bank systems.
Regulatory compliance continued to rise in importance. This is due in part to MIFID II as well as
increased non-financial regulatory reporting requirements. New EU and Dutch non-financial
reporting directives took effect during 2017 and are required for the 2017 reporting period.
Sustainable client transactions and investments continued to be material in the eyes of stakeholders.
NIBC has embraced sustainability in its financings and investments, particularly focusing on clients in
the sub-sectors renewable energy, infrastructure, real estate, agriculture, and shipping. During our
consultations, stakeholders told us they appreciated our efforts in this respect.
Diversity was also a material aspect reflecting increasing awareness of both external stakeholders and
employees. As of 1 January NIBC formed a new ExCo of which 33% are women. During 2017,
64 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
gender diversity improved at several levels within the bank, though further progress is needed to
meet our goals.
Clients
Our clients are our top priority and fundamental to our performance as a bank. We maintain long-
term relationships with our clients; understanding their business, anticipating their needs and
delivering the best possible service. We recognise that each client and situation is unique, and want
to create lasting value for them.
As part of our duty of care towards our clients, we gather feedback from clients and customers at
every opportunity. Our main client groups include:
■ Corporate clients;
■ Entrepreneurial investors;
■ Institutional investors;
■ Financial sponsors;
■ Retail customers.
We measure satisfaction levels through formal channels such as NPS surveys of corporate clients
directly after deals are closed and our NIBC Direct Customer Survey of retail customers. For more
information about our engagement with clients, please refer to the Corporate Clients and Retail
Clients sections in this Annual Report.
Employees
Our focus on our people is part of our strategic commitment to being a sustainable and profitable
banking franchise. We aim to be an attractive employer for people from all backgrounds. As part of
our efforts to give back to local communities, we also encourage our people to volunteer their time
and skills to help others.
ExCo members meet regularly with employees on an informal basis during which employees can
raise any topics, concerns or other comments. Regular Town Hall sessions led by ExCo members, are
held every two months, to cover topics such as financial results and strategy updates. As part of our
Talent Programme, young trainees are offered the opportunity to present inventive and challenging
business cases to the ExCo.
Over the past several years, employability has been a rising concern for our employees due in part to
workforce reductions at larger peers in the financial sector. Therefore NIBC has continued to
increase its investments in employees' personal and professional development. This is not only good
business practice, but also helps to ensure NIBC will have the skills and knowledge to meet its clients'
future needs.
As part of our efforts to give back to local communities, we also encourage our people to volunteer
their time and skills to help others, as you can read in the Sustainability section of this report. For
more information about diversity and our engagement with employees during the year, please refer
to the Our People section in this Annual Report.
Regulators
We maintain strong and open relationships with our regulators, governments and other supervisory
bodies. We are committed to collaborating closely with relevant authorities, being transparent in our
dealings, and meeting their expectations.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 65
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Our primary regulating entity is the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). In 2017, we had regular contact and
maintained an open and ongoing dialogue with the DNB, most notably, in areas such as risk
management, capital and liquidity, asset quality, and relevant developments in Europe.
We also maintained our relations with the Dutch financial markets regulator, the Authority for the
Financial Markets (AFM), and with regulators abroad through our international offices.
Furthermore, NIBC proactively communicates with tax authorities, evidenced by its ongoing
agreement on horizontal supervision with the Dutch tax authorities.
Society at large
NIBC wants to play a role in addressing environmental and social issues in the communities where it
is active by being a responsible corporate citizen. Our ambition to be a trustworthy, transparent and
sustainable bank requires us to take action to minimise our impact on the environment and to
contribute to building a sustainable society for future generations. We therefore look to proactively
engage with relevant civil society, local and community organisations.
Dialogue with civil society organizations was frequent throughout 2017. Regular discussions with civil
society organisations were important, particularly in light of the UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), the Paradise Papers, the IMVO agreement for the Dutch banking sector, and the Berlin
COP23 climate conference. For more information about our engagement with local and community
organisations, please refer to the Sustainability chapter in this Annual Report.
NIBC NGO Boulevard
In 2015, we launched the NIBC NGO Boulevard, an initiative to allow our offices and facilities to be
used in support of good causes. In 2017, the NGO Boulevard grew to six Dutch civil society
organisations: Maatschappelijke Alliantie, Missing Chapter, Sovic, SDG Nederlands, Stichting Vitalis and
Buddy Network. One focus area for all of these organisations has been to contribute to Dutch
efforts towards the SDGs through their activities and initiatives.
NIBC aims to help these civil society organisations to be effective and increase their impact. At the
same time, since we share the same facilities, these organisations help to increase NIBC bankers’
awareness of societal challenges and inspire us. Engagement with these civil society organisations has
led to several joint workshops on societal challenges. Further joint initiatives focused on topics such
as financial education, circular economy, and mobility are planned for 2018.
Community engagement
NIBC wants to be a good corporate citizen by contributing to the well-being of the societies in which
we operate. We encourage our employees to volunteer their time and expertise to community
projects, and support their initiatives by matching the money they raise for good causes. In addition,
NIBC runs its own social projects, some of which are focused on helping to educate youngsters
about prudent money management. In this paragraph you’ll find information about our social projects
and community activities. Please visit our website for more information.
NIBC employees were active in a wide range of initiatives in our communities during 2017. In March
15 NIBC employees led by our CFO Herman Dijkhuizen again conducted financial education classes
during the Week van het Geld (Global Money Week), an initiative whereby bankers provide fun
lessons about money to primary school children. Approximately 700 primary school children
participated in this Bank voor de Klas program with NIBC staff.
66 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Young NIBC organised an ‘NIBC Challenge’ together with the Voedselbank Haaglanden (Foodbank
Haaglanden). Over 25 enthusiastic colleagues together with volunteers from the Voedselbank worked
to find solutions for optimising cash flows at Voedselbank Haaglanden. This ‘Bank for a Bank’ initiative
resulted in five concrete ideas, varying from ‘online supermarket customers donating money to the
Voedselbank’ to ‘collecting leftover festival coins at the end of events’. Young NIBC plans to organise a
comparable community event every year.
NIBC Markets held an employee fundraising drive to benefit Kika, the children's cancer charity. In
December, employees in The Hague supported Stichting Vitalis in what has become an annual
holiday tradition at the bank. Vitalis is a professional non-profit organisation that supports vulnerable
children so they can avoid intensive professional youth counseling programmes. NIBC employees
provided personalised holiday gifts for more than 100 children in an event that involved fun activities,
cupcake decorating and refreshments.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY
BOARD
The Supervisory Board is proud to present that 2017 was an extremely
strong year for NIBC in all respects. We saw strong results in profit,
product portfolio and client franchise in both Retail and Corporate
client offering. For the Supervisory Board 2017 was also a year of in-
depth discussions and deliberations on NIBC’s strategic alternatives.
NIBC delivered an extremely strong performance in 2017. It did so by continuing its strategy of a
focused approach to select market niches in the dynamic mid-sized segment. Hereby NIBC
significantly strengthened its franchise and expanded its offering to clients. NIBC's net profit
attributable to shareholders more than doubled from EUR 102 million in 2016 to EUR 210 million in
2017 (+106%). Our most important stakeholder, the customer, appreciated our efforts to serve his
interests even more than before: our NPS for corporate clients rose to +64% in 2017 (2016: +37%)
and our NIBC Direct Customer Survey rose to 7.9 (2016: 7.6). The Supervisory Board finds these
scores very important, because the success of a mid-sized niche market bank and retail offering like
NIBC stands or falls with an excellent customer experience.
The Supervisory Board notes with satisfaction that NIBC proves it has the agility to continuously
reinvent itself. In 2017, NIBC more than ever showed it can make a difference at its clients’ most
decisive moments.
Corporate client offering
In 2017, corporate client offering achieved strong results in almost all products and (sub)sectors.
Initially a lending house for mostly medium-sized family businesses, NIBC corporate client offering has
transformed into a full-service, mid-market bank that is equipped to deliver on the entire liability side
of the client's balance sheet. NIBC corporate client offering primarily achieves this by leveraging its
expertise in key (sub)sectors where it can add the greatest value through its tailored solutions and
services. NIBC corporate client offering continued its gradual shift in client groups. It focuses on mid-
sized and usually family-owned companies in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK, but because of
the growing product range it more and more attracts other highly relevant client groups: private
equity funds and parties, institutional investors, financial sponsors and large corporate clients.
Retail client offering
In 2017, retail client offering nearly doubled its mortgage origination volume to nearly EUR 2 billion.
The total mortgage book increased by more than 3%, including an acquisition of a mortgage portfolio
of 0.2 billion. In savings, our newly introduced quarterly savings product was well received by the
market. After the product launch in April 2017, clients shifted an additional EUR 150 million in
deposits to our line-up of on-demand accounts. The Supervisory Board has gladly taken note of the
fact that the NIBC Direct Customer Survey rose to 7.9, up from the already high level of 7.6 in the
preceding year.
New targets and review of strategic alternatives
The Supervisory Board is proud that NIBC achieved all of its 2015-2017 targets. We realize that
good economic conditions in its home markets helped NIBC in this period, but the Board strongly
believes that NIBC’s delivery upon its clear strategy was key to the success.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 71
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board has taken notice of and supports the newly announced medium-term
objectives like a sustainable Return on Equity of 10-12% and a cost/income ratio structurally below
45%, the aim for a CET1 capital ratio above 14%, a dividend pay-out of at least 50% of net profit and
a long-term BBB+ credit rating.
We believe the credit rating upgrades by S&P and Fitch and the strong investor demand for our AT I
bond in September 2017 reflect the market’s confidence in our strategy, people and objectives.
In August 2017, NIBC announced that it commenced a review of its strategic alternatives, backed by
its shareholders. The Supervisory Board was and is actively involved in this process.
INSTALLATION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
As per 1 January 2017 an Executive Committee (ExCo) was installed. In 2017, the ExCo comprised of
the three Managing Board members together with Saskia Hovers (Corporate clients sectors), Michel
Kant (Retail clients) and Caroline Oosterbaan (Corporate clients products).
NIBC chose to amend its top structure by creating this ExCo to safeguard and strengthen the
commercial and client-facing roles at executive level. The Supervisory Board is fully supportive that
NIBC further strengthened its client focus as a pivotal element of its strategy with these
appointments.
All ExCo members have been present at the meetings of the Supervisory Board. Through these
meetings, in addition to the regular informal contacts, the Supervisory Board stays closely tuned with
all developments throughout the focus areas of the individual ExCo members.
COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Throughout the year, NIBC’s Supervisory Board has performed its vital duties towards the company’s
stakeholders, and had full access to all necessary information and company staff members. We would
like to extend our thanks to all our stakeholders for providing us this information.
As per 31 December 2017 the Supervisory Board comprised of one female and seven male
members of many nationalities. Five members are independent members that meet the
independence criteria laid out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The other three are
representatives of our shareholders.

Changes in 2017
In 2017 new member Richard Carrión was appointed to the NIBC Supervisory Board. He started as
per 29 September, and became member of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee. Supervisory
Board member Dick Sluimers was appointed vice chairman as per 1 July 2017. He succeeded David
Morgan, who was a NIBC Supervisory Board member for seven years. Sally Rocker also resigned in
2017 as a NIBC Supervisory Board member, having been part of the Board for eight years. The
Supervisory Board wishes to express its gratitude to both of them for their great and continuous
input and efforts in recent years. Both were representatives of our shareholders.
Because 2018 will be a year of strategical importance, stability is key for NIBC’s Supervisory Board.
For this reason Adam de Jong, chairman of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee, was
reappointed for maximum one more year till December 2018, despite the expiration of his fourth
term in 2017. In January 2018, Supervisory Board’s chairman Wim van den Goorbergh, for the same
reason, was reappointed for a maximum of one year till May 2019.
Diversity and succession
In March 2017 the Remuneration and Nominating Committee of the Supervisory Board made a
succession planning for the near future. The Supervisory Board is generally satisfied with its current
composition and that of its Committees, but would strongly welcome greater diversity in terms of
gender, age and skills. In the case of a vacancy, the regular policy is applied in which the Executive
Search team is asked to provide a shortlist with at least 50% female candidates, although final
selection is ultimately based on the suitability for a specific position.
The Supervisory Board realizes that one female member on a total of eight is far below our own
wishes and goals. For that reason the Supervisory Board did its best to find a female successor for
Sally Rocker. Unfortunately it appeared to be difficult to find female candidates that are interested to
fulfil this position in the financial services industry, fit the profile and have not reached the maximum
number of supervisory memberships (according to Dutch law).
Following the succession planning, the NIBC Supervisory Board will need at least two new members
in 2018. With the support of an executive search firm we will start a new search, again with a
preference for female candidates. The first new member is due to be appointed in April 2018,
depending on the approval of the DNB.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 73
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Supervisory Board has the intention to reduce its size to seven members in the coming years.
The Dutch Corporate Governance Code
The charter of the Supervisory Board and its committees were updated in 2017 to reflect the new
Dutch Corporate Governance Code that was revised in 2016.
All members of the Supervisory Board meet the criteria of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
relating to other positions, insofar as they are relevant to the performance of the Supervisory Board
member’s duties.
Since the Dutch Act on Management and Supervision came into force on 1 January 2013, we have
been monitoring the number of supervisory functions held by our Supervisory Board members.
When a Supervisory Board member is appointed or reappointed, compliance with this new law is
verified. The profile for the Supervisory Board and their relevant ancillary positions can be found on
our website.
Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board met on six occasions in 2017. This included three regular two-day meetings in
March, August and November and two regular one-day meetings in June and December. An
additional one-day meeting in June was held at which the Supervisory Board and the Executive
Committee discussed NIBC’s current and future strategy. All but one members of the Supervisory
Board participated in all meetings in 2017; this one member was absent from one meeting. One of
these meetings took place in our London office and one in our Amsterdam office.
The members of the Executive Committee attended all meetings of the Supervisory Board (illness
was the only reason for absence). Additionally, three members of the Supervisory Board attended
two consultation meetings between the Chief Executive Officer and the Works Council.
During the regular meetings, the Supervisory Board conducted extensive discussions relating to
NIBC’s future strategy; different strategic options were extensively discussed and weighed.
Furthermore during the regular meetings the Supervisory Board discussed the Corporate and Retail
client offering, the further integration of NIBC Markets, risk management, IT Forward, the funding
profile, the regulatory environment and reporting, and new initiatives. The 2017 quarterly and
interim results were discussed as well as the budget for 2018.
The Supervisory Board also continued its permanent education programme. During these meetings
the UK market in combination with Brexit were discussed as well as governance issues around a
potential strategic change.
There were no transactions in the year in which the members of the Supervisory Board had a
conflict of interest. The financial statements and the findings of the external auditor were discussed in
the external auditor’s presence.
THE FOUR SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES
Most of the discussions and decisions of the Supervisory Board were prepared in the four
committees referred to below. The committees of the Supervisory Board each have an independent
chairman.

of its annual financial statements and reports. The Audit Committee also advises on corporate
governance and internal governance.
The Audit Committee met on four occasions in 2017 (March, June, August and November) in
presence of the Managing Board. One member of the Audit Committee was absent during one
meeting. By mutual agreement the external auditor was represented at all meetings of the Audit
Committee in 2017. The external auditor had one meeting with the Audit Committee without the
members of the Managing Board.
The chairman of the Audit Committee prepared the meetings in advance by having meetings/calls
with NIBC’s CFO, the head of Finance and the head of Internal Audit. In between meetings NIBC
also shared relevant information with the chairman.
In 2017, the Audit Committee extensively reviewed NIBC’s quarterly financial highlights, half-yearly
and annual financial reports and related press releases. It discussed the draft reports of the external
auditor, including its Board Report, before the reports were discussed in the Supervisory Board
meeting.
The Audit Committee had in depth discussions about NIBC’s financial performance, including the
development of the bank’s net profit, business growth and the development of spreads and cost/
income ratios. Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviewed NIBC’s liquidity and its funding profile,
including AT 1 issuance, and the development of related liquidity and solvency ratios.
Specific topics discussed with the auditor dealt with loan loss provisioning, sale of legacy portfolios,
NIBC’s change agenda, new developments on e.g. Basel IV and its impact on financial results and
fraud risk. Specific topic on the 2017 agenda was the impact of IFRS 9, specifically the reclassification
of the Mortgage Loan portfolio at FVtPL to amortised cost in line with industry standard.
The Audit Committee kept itself informed of the state and developments of NIBC’s Information
Technology, and more specifically the IT Forward programme. It also considered the integration of
NIBC Markets, its activities and the alignment of policies and procedures.
The Audit Committee took note of and discussed NIBC’s consultations with DNB, the Dutch central
bank. The AC considered the (preliminary) results of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.
It also considered on-site examinations conducted by DNB, including examinations of AIRB models,
data quality and the asset quality review (AQR) follow-up on NIBC’s corporate loan portfolio.
The Audit Committee discussed the annual plan and quarterly reports of Internal Audit, and
evaluated the functioning of Internal Audit. Both the internal and external auditor reported on the
quality and effectiveness of governance, internal control and risk management.
Remuneration and Nominating Committee
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee (RNC) advises the Supervisory Board on the
remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board and certain other
senior managers. In addition, it provides the Supervisory Board with proposals for appointments and
reappointments to the Supervisory Board, its committees and the Managing Board.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 75
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee also evaluates the performance of the other
Supervisory Board committees, and assesses the performance of the members of the Managing
Board and the Supervisory Board. As part of the annual evaluation process carried out by the RNC
Mr. P. de Wilt (CEO) and Mr. H. Dijkhuizen (CFO) have been reappointed for their second term.
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee monitors the remuneration policy as well as the
execution of it, which entails discussing the total available pool for variable compensation and defining
the collective and individual performance targets that form the basis for the variable compensation of
individual members of the Managing Board. Furthermore, the committee oversees the remuneration
of the so-called Identified Staff employees whose professional activities have a material impact on
NIBC’s risk profile and determines the remuneration of the control functions.
In 2017, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee held six regular meetings and four additional
conference calls in the presence of NIBC’s head of Human Resources and, in appropriate cases, of
NIBC’s CEO. Additionally, a delegation of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee attended a
meeting of the control functions. The Remuneration and Nominating Committee discussed the
regular subjects regarding remuneration, risk and audit assessments, governance and variable income
as well as the vacancies and nominations for the Supervisory Board and its committees. Due to the
upcoming changes to the Supervisory Board and the extensive evaluation performed end of 2016, no
specific evaluation of the Supervisory Board took place in 2017. The chairman of the Remuneration
and Nominating Committee prepared the meetings in advance by having meetings/calls with the CEO
and the head of Human Resources.
Remuneration management
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy this year, taking
into account relevant legislation and guidelines, amongst others the European Banking Authority (EBA)
guidelines on sound remuneration policies. Besides legislation, the RNC has taken market
circumstances and developments into consideration. The positioning of NIBC in relevant labour
markets was monitored by means of benchmark surveys. Attention was also paid to broader
developments in society, as the RNC is well aware of public concerns about remuneration in the
financial industry. The Supervisory Board amended the remuneration policy, fulfilling all legislative
changes as proposed by the Remuneration and Nominating Committee.
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee also discussed the performance of the Managing
Board, the Executive Committee and its members and set financial and non-financial targets.
Given the importance of the subject, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee extensively
discussed the overall available funding for variable compensation and determined the proposed
distribution to Identified Staff. In this respect, the risk assessments (including malus and clawback
assessments) were discussed and taken into account in the decision making. The surrounding
governance and the developments in the area of governance and legislation were explicitly discussed
in the Remuneration and Nominating Committee, given the sensibility of the subject of remuneration.
The Committee also determined the obligatory disclosures on the Identified Staff and on the
remuneration policy.
In line with the Remuneration Policy the RNC received information for a hybrid benchmark peer
group reflecting the labour market of NIBC as well as a benchmark regarding post-employment
benefits. Based on this information the Remuneration and Nominating Committee proposed to the
Supervisory Board to adjust the salaries of the Managing Board members as per 1 January 2018,
which proposal was approved by the Supervisory Board and the shareholders. Furthermore the
76 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
RNC discussed and developed scenarios for retention packages for the members of the Managing
Board and Executive Committee in the light of potential strategic options.
Succession management
On proposal of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee the Supervisory Board installed the
Executive Committee as of 1 January 2017. As mentioned earlier, the Executive Committee consists
of three Managing Board members and three non-statutory members representing the commercial
activities of NIBC.
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee also extensively discussed the succession
management regarding the Supervisory Board in the light of the resignation of two members as well
as of the expiring terms of appointment. On its proposal the Supervisory Board decided to appoint
Mr. Carrión as representative of the shareholder, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, the Remuneration
and Nominating Committee conducted a search process leading to the proposal of another
appointment, which is now at the supervisory authority’s discretion.
In its meetings the Remuneration and Nominating Committee has closely monitored management
development and succession management throughout the bank. The Committee’s chairman has
continued to hold regular talks with senior managers to gain a deeper understanding of their
professional development and of internal developments taking place within the bank.
Risk Policy & Compliance Committee
The Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC) assists the Supervisory Board in supervising NIBC’s
risk appetite, risk profile and risk policy. It prepares issues in these areas for decision in the
Supervisory Board by presenting proposals and recommendations on credit, market, investment,
liquidity, operational and compliance/regulatory risks, and any other material risks to which NIBC is
exposed. The Risk Policy & Compliance Committee met four times in 2017 in the presence of
members of the Managing Board.
During 2017, the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee extensively discussed NIBC’s assets, liquidity
and funding, stress tests and risk profile. A topic that was on the agenda throughout 2017 was NIBC’s
risk appetite framework and the forward looking nature thereof. The Risk Policy & Compliance
Committee discussed NIBC’s long-term objectives, including the attainment and retention of a BBB
credit rating, and appraised developments in the six defined pillars of risk appetite (franchise,
solvency, profitability, liquidity, funding and asset quality). Updates to the risk appetite framework,
involving new metrics, revised limits and a benchmark against EU banks, were reviewed and
approved.
Besides risk appetite and the quarterly reporting on the subject received by the Risk Policy &
Compliance Committee, the RPCC discussed in all of its meetings segments of NIBC’s corporate and
retail credit portfolios, including appropriate risk measurement parameters for portfolio performance,
the bank’s distressed portfolio, as well as specific distressed exposures.
Other topics the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee regularly reviewed included NIBC’s market
risk reports, liquidity risk reports and risks of the macroeconomic environment, such as the availability
of FX-funding and the impact of Brexit.
On the non-financial risk side, the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee reviewed NIBC’s franchise as
reflected in the experience of its customers, the relation with the regulators, the views of the rating
agencies and its operational risk profile and in-control environment, including specific risks such as
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 77
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
information security, new product approvals and significant changes within the organisation (including
certain IT related initiatives), as well as compliance and regulatory risk. The committee also reviewed
the risk assessments of new business initiatives, evaluated how risk awareness is embedded in NIBC’s
organisation, as well as its own functioning. In addition, it regularly reviewed and discussed market and
regulatory developments and their impact on NIBC, such as the implementation of MIFID II and
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the resolution plan, the DNB review of AIRB models
and evolving solvency requirements as a result of new developments e.g. Basel IV.
Related Party Transactions Committee
The Related Party Transactions Committee (RPTC) assists the Supervisory Board in assessing material
transactions of any kind with a person or group of persons who hold, directly or indirectly, at least
10% of NIBC’s issued and outstanding share capital, or of 10% of the voting rights at the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders. The same applies to any person affiliated with any such person(s)
that meet(s) these criteria. A transaction will, in any event, be considered material if the amount
involved exceeds EUR 10 million. The Supervisory Board has delegated the authority to approve
such material transactions to the Related Party Transactions Committee.
In the Supervisory Board meeting of 7 June 2017, it was approved that NIBC would perform an
advisory role to JC Flowers & Co. in the HSH transaction. End of June 2017 the Related Party
Transactions Committee agreed that in the HSH bidding document, mention would be made of JC
Flowers & Co.’s intention to have NIBC as a participant in this investment. On 23 October 2017, the
Related Party Transactions Committee gave its approval to the Managing Board’s decision to
indirectly participate up to a certain maximum amount in the HSH transaction, which was reported
to the Supervisory Board in its November meeting.

REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Supervisory Board reviewed and amended NIBC’s remuneration
policy in 2017. The review took account of all relevant laws, regulations
and guidelines: the Dutch Corporate Governance Code; the Dutch
Banking Code; the DNB Principles on Sound Remuneration Policies (DNB
principles), EBA Guidelines on Sound Remuneration; and CRDIV and
the Dutch remuneration legislation for financial services companies
(Wet beloningsbeleid financiële onderneming, Wbfo).
NIBC’s remuneration policy and Managing Board remuneration for 2017 are outlined in this chapter.
An overview of the remuneration of other staff and the Supervisory Board is also presented. Please
see our website for further information about the remuneration policy.
To avoid unnecessary duplication, we refer to note 7 and 55 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Annual Report for all relevant tables. These are considered to be an integral part of this
Remuneration Report.
Remuneration principles
NIBC’s remuneration policy is sustainable, balanced and in line with our chosen strategy and risk
appetite. It revolves around these five key principles: remuneration is (i) aligned with NIBC’s business
strategy and risk appetite; (ii) appropriately balanced between short and long term; (iii) differentiated
and linked to the achievement of performance objectives and the results of the Bank; (iv) externally
competitive and internally fair; and (v) managed in an integrated manner that takes into account total
compensation.
Managing Board remuneration in 2017
In order to determine appropriate market levels of remuneration for the Managing Board, the
Supervisory Board has identified a hybrid benchmark peer group, consisting of all AEX and AMX
(both Euronext) listed companies. The composition of this peer group reflects the labour market in
which NIBC competes for talent. As such, it is an objective measure outside NIBC’s control.
Throughout the cycle, total compensation for the CEO and members of the Managing Board is
targeted just below the median of their peers in the peer group, based on benchmark data provided
by external independent compensation consultants.
Base salaries
In 2017, the base salary for the CEO was EUR 800,000 gross per year (equal to 2016). The base
salary for the two other members of the Managing Board was EUR 550,000 gross per year (also
equal to 2016). Base salaries are paid in 12 equal monthly payments.
Variable compensation
According to the remuneration policy, the variable income component in 2017 for the Managing
Board is set at 15% of base salary at target achievement (with a maximum of 20% of the base salary).
Over 2017 the following incentive compensations of base salary were granted: Chief Executive
Officer 20%, Chief Financial Officer 20% and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) 20%, being the maximum. The
Supervisory Board decided to award the maximum variable income given the extremely strong
results in 2017.
80 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT
For all members of the Managing Board (and Identified Staff) this variable compensation is delivered
in a pre-defined mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in phantom share units (PSUs) and 20%
in unvested PSUs. In this way, NIBC complies with regulations (EBA/Wbfo) that require Identified
Staff to receive 50% of all variable compensation in the form of equity or equity-linked instruments
and for at least 40% of both the cash and equity component to be deferred. For the Managing Board,
the holding period of the equity-linked instruments is set to five years as required by the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code.
Pension
The CEO and other Managing Board members participate in the NIBC pension plan, in line with the
arrangements available to all other employees. In 2017, the pension plan consisted of a) a collective
defined-contribution pension arrangement (CDC arrangement) up to a pensionable salary of
EUR 103,317 maximum salary, and; b) an additional (gross) contribution up to their respective base
salaries. The retirement age for the CEO and members of the Managing Board was 67 in 2017.
There are no contractual early retirement provisions.
For the CDC arrangement NIBC pays a standard flat-rate contribution of 26% into the pension fund
(for the Managing Board as well as for all other employees). All employees are required to make a
personal contribution of 4% of their pensionable salary in the CDC arrangement.
Other key benefits
The CEO and members of the Managing Board are entitled to a company car up to a certain price
limit or, if they prefer, the equivalent value of the lease car limit as a gross cash allowance.
As is the case with all our employees, the members of the Managing Board are entitled to a
contribution towards their disability insurance, accident insurance and permanent travel insurance.
Employment contracts
The CEO and members of the Managing Board all have indefinite employment contracts, which are
fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Their appointment to the Managing
Board is for a maximum term of four years. The term can be renewed.
Any severance payment is limited to 12 months’ base salary.
Amendments in 2018
The Supervisory Board reviews the level of base salaries against the market each year and may
decide to adjust it. In 2017, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee of the Supervisory Board
thoroughly reviewed the Managing Board remuneration. Hereby it took into account all relevant
benchmarks, such as the hybrid benchmark peer group in the relevant environment for NIBC, as well
as a benchmark regarding the post-employment benefits. Based on this information the
Remuneration and Nominating Committee proposed to the Supervisory Board to adjust the salaries
of the CEO and the other members of the Managing Board as per 1 January 2018. The Supervisory
Board has decided that the CEO will receive an annual base salary of EUR 825,000 as per 1 January
2018 (2017: EUR 800.000), while the other members of the Managing Board will receive a base
salary of EUR 600.000 (2017: EUR 550.000).
Because of past arrangements NIBC still has various remuneration instruments, that are derived from
equities. To simplify the administration of these instruments the last tranches of Conditional Restricted
Depository Receipts (CRDRs) will vest (partly accelerated) into Conditional Common Depository
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 81
REMUNERATION REPORT
Receipts (CCDRs) per 1 January 2018. All CCDRs will be converted into Common Depository
Receipts (CDRs) in January 2018 in line with the NIBC plan rules variable compensation.
Other staff remuneration
In line with the DNB Principles, employees whose professional activities have a material impact on
NIBC’s risk profile are designated Identified Staff. Specific remuneration conditions may apply to
Identified Staff (other than Managing Board members). The outlines of the remuneration policies for
Identified Staff and other staff are given below. For further details on the policies for Identified Staff,
please see our website.
Total compensation funding
Each year, based on a proposal by the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board decides, at its
discretion, on the overall amount of money available for total compensation, the amount of money
available for variable compensation and the specific forms in which variable compensation may be
awarded. The 2017 compensation ratio (total compensation costs as percentage of operating
income) was 20.9%.
Variable compensation
All employees with a function contract have a pre-agreed set of financial and non-financial (at least
50%) performance targets. Their performance assessments take into account the achievement of pre-
agreed targets, how they have behaved according to NIBC’s corporate values, as well as their
contributions towards the bank’s longer-term objectives. Non-financial performance aspects include
client satisfaction, employee satisfaction, transparency, and sustainability. The Dutch Banking Code
serves as a guideline for all employees.
Whether or not an employee actually receives a variable compensation for his performance, is wholly
discretionary and depends on the overall financial and non-financial performance of the bank, of his
respective business unit, his personal performance and the relevant market levels of remuneration.
Employees do not qualify for variable remuneration if their performance has been inadequate or
poor, if they have failed to meet duty-of-care or compliance requirements, if they have displayed
behaviour contrary to NIBC’s policies and corporate values, or if they were subject to disciplinary
action.
As for the Managing Board, the variable compensation, if any, for employees, is delivered in various
components:
1. cash;
2. deferred cash;
3. vested phantom share units;
4. unvested PSUs.
The Managing Board determines the precise split between cash and equity or equity-linked
components, the proportion of deferred compensation and the form in which this is distributed
(such as cash or unvested equity), whether a threshold applies for the deferred component and, if so,
how high that threshold is.
For Identified staff, no threshold applies and any variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined
mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in PSUs and 20% in unvested PSUs. In this way, NIBC
complies with regulations that require Identified Staff to receive 50% of all variable compensation in
the form of equity or equity-linked instruments and for at least 40% of both the cash and equity
component to be deferred.
82 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT
For employees with a scale contract (in the Netherlands) it has been agreed upon that they will
receivea fixed amount of EUR 1,000 over 2017, which qualifies as variable compensation. It has also
been (conditionally) agreed upon to award all employees with a package in the light of potential
strategic options. This amount qualifies as variable remuneration in 2017.
Special situations
Only in exceptional cases and only in the first year of employment the Managing Board can offer sign-
on or guaranteed minimum bonuses to new employees and retention bonuses to existing employees.
In the unlikely event that these bonuses amount to more than 100% of the base salary of the
individual employee concerned, procedures will be followed in accordance with the regulations; the
maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration will be respected. This has not occured in
2017.
Any severance payment made if NIBC terminates employment without cause, is subject to local
legislation. For the Netherlands, the prevailing business court guidelines (transition formula) and, in
the case of reorganisation, NIBC’s Social Protocol, are applicable. Special compensation plans for
specific groups of employees are subject to prior approval by the Managing Board, which annually
informs the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board about these
arrangements.
Pension amendments in 2018
The pension scheme for employees is amended per 2018. The retirement age will become 68 year
(2017: 67 years) to fulfill the 2018 fiscal legislation. This is also applicable for all members of the
Managing Board. The financial agreement has been renewed for the coming three years (2018-2020).
NIBC pays a standard flat rate contribution of 27.2% (2017: 26.0%) into the pension fund for the
CDC arrangement. All employees (including the Managing Board) are required to make a personal
contribution of 4.2% (2017: 4.0%) of their pensionable salary into the CDC arrangement as per
1 January 2018.
The gross contribution for pensions above the fiscal maximum is now set at 25% (until 2017 this
contribution was age dependent).
Supervisory Board remuneration in 2017
The Supervisory Board remuneration had been stable for years. A review of the Supervisory Board
remuneration showed that some Dutch banks had adjusted their remuneration for the Supervisory
Board in recent years. Based on the comparison with other financial institutions, NIBC’s shareholders
amended the remuneration of the Supervisory Board per 1 January 2017 as described below.
The chairman of the Supervisory Board is as per 1 January 2017 entitled to an annual fee of
EUR 75,000 (2016: EUR 60,000), the vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board is entitled to an annual
fee of EUR 60,000 (2016: EUR 50,000) and the other members of the Supervisory Board are entitled
to an annual fee of EUR 50,000 (2016: EUR 40,000).
In addition, all chairmen of the AC, RPCC and RNC of the Supervisory Board are, as of 1 January
2017, entitled to an annual fee of EUR 15,000 (in 2016 there was no distinction in fee between
chairmen and members). The other members of the committees received a lower fee than in the
years before as the reassessment led to an amended remuneration structure. Members of the Audit
Committee are as per 1 January 2017 entitled to an annual fee of EUR 10,000 (2016: EUR 15,000).
The members of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee are also entitled to an annual fee of
EUR 10,000 (2016: EUR 11,500). The members of the Renumeration and Nominating Committee
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 83
REMUNERATION REPORT
are entitled to an annual fee of EUR 7,500 (2016: EUR 10,000). The members of the Related Party
Transaction Committee are entitled to an annual fee of nil (2016: nil).
All members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to reimbursement of genuine business expenses
incurred in fulfilling their duties.
Remuneration governance
In line with the various recommendations and guidelines issued by regulators, NIBC has strengthened
governance around the annual remuneration process and agreed upon key roles for the Human
Resources, Risk Management, Compliance, Audit and Finance functions (control functions).
The Supervisory Board discussed the performance and remuneration of Identified Staff, as well as the
performance and remuneration of control functions. The Supervisory Board also discussed the
highest proposed variable compensations in 2017. Scenario analyses were conducted by Risk
Management to assess the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components on an
individual and collective basis. The internal annual report 'Harrewijn' is discussed in the RNC as well
as with the Works Council. Amongst others the report covers an internal pay ratio analysis. As from
2018 onwards NIBC will disclose the relevant elements related to the pay ratios in line with Dutch
Corporate Governance Code.
Adjustments
Any vested amounts of variable remuneration are subject to clawback by the Supervisory Board in
the event they have been based on inaccurate financial or other data, fraud, or when the employee in
question is dismissed ‘for cause’. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board has
the discretion to adjust downwards any or all variable remuneration if, in its opinion, this
remuneration could have unfair or unintended effects. In assessing performance against pre-agreed
performance criteria, financial performance shall be adjusted to allow for estimated risks and capital
costs. In addition to clawbacks, the concept of ‘malus’ is part of the remuneration policy. This is an
arrangement that permits NIBC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of deferred
compensation in relation to risk outcomes of performance. Malus is a form of ex-post risk
adjustment, one of the key requirements in addition to ex-ante risk adjustments.
If an employee resigns, any unvested amounts of compensation are forfeited.
Conclusion
The Renumeration and Nominating Committee and the Supervisory Board believe NIBC’s
remuneration policy responsibly links performance and reward and is compliant with the applicable
laws, regulations and guidelines. The Supervisory Board continues to believe in prudent management
of remuneration whilst recognising that NIBC operates in a competitive market place where it needs
to be able to attract, motivate and retain sufficient talent.
NIBC is determined to make a positive contribution towards fair compensation practices in the
banking sector in consultation with its stakeholders. Furthermore, we aim to create the level playing
field that regulators envisage with regard to variable compensation.
Disclosure on Dutch Remuneration Legislation for Financial Services Companies
The total amount of variable income granted in 2017, with respect to the performance over 2016,
amounts to EUR 8.1 million. This grant consists of (direct and deferred) cash and (vested and
unvested) share based instruments. In 2017 one employee was awarded a total compensation of
more than EUR 1.0 million (in 2016 also one employee).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
At NIBC, we endeavour to maintain a sound, transparent and efficient
governance system that is broadly aligned to best practices in our
industry. The Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Dutch Banking
Code form the base of our governance system and guide the way we
work at NIBC.
This chapter contains some highlights of our governance structure in 2017. The structures and
processes we have developed provide an effective basis for making and implementing decisions across
our organisation, with its hierarchical and functional reporting lines.
Our website contains our articles of association, charters, relevant policies and other information on
corporate governance and the compliance statements with respect to the Dutch Banking Code and
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. To the extent applicable, NIBC also adheres to
international governance standards such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance.
NIBC maintains a two-tier board structure consisting of a Managing Board and a Supervisory Board.
The Managing Board is responsible for the day-to-day management, which includes, among other
things, formulating NIBC’s strategy and policies and setting and achieving NIBC’s objectives. The
Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Managing Board.
MANAGING BOARD
In 2017, NIBC had three Managing Board members. These members have thorough and in-depth
knowledge of the financial sector in general and the banking sector in particular.
For the composition of the Managing Board as per 31 December 2017, see the following table:

In case of a vacancy in the Managing Board, the regular policy is applied and the Executive Search
team is asked to provide a shortlist with at least 50% female candidates, although final selection is
ultimately based on the suitability for the position. NIBC will continue to strive for a good gender
balance in the Managing Board and enhance the chance of the appointment of one or more female
candidates in future.
Executive Committee
As per 1 January 2017 an Executive Committee was formed consisting of the three Managing Board
members and three non-statutory members representing commercial roles. The Executive
Committee consists of two female members and four male members. The Managing Board and the
Executive Committee, which meet weekly, represent and balance the interests of all stakeholders.
The non-statutory members of the Executive Committee are invited to attend meetings of the
Managing Board, unless otherwise decided by the chairman of the Managing Board. The non-

1 July 2017 Mr. Sluimers was appointed vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board. As per
29 September 2017 Mr. Carrión was appointed Supervisory Board member and member of the Risk
Policy & Compliance Committee.
Because 2018 will be a year of strategical importance, stability is key for NIBC’s Supervisory Board.
For this reason, Mr. de Jong, chairman of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee, was reappointed
for maximum one more year till December 2018 during an Extraordinary General Meeting of
shareholders in September 2017 (Mr. de Jong’s term would expire in 2017). In January 2018,
Supervisory Board’s chairman Wim van den Goorbergh, for the same reason, was reappointed for
maximum one more year till May 2019.

DUTCH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
NIBC supports and voluntarily applies the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This
Code has been revised in December 2016. The most important revision is the focus on long-term
value creation and the introduction of culture as part of good corporate governance. In addition, the
Code has been updated on many other points. NIBC supported the revision and applied the revised
Dutch Corporate Governance Code in 2017.
NIBC partly deviates from best practices and principles as laid out in the Code. The main deviation is
that we do not comply with best practice provision 2.1.7 (iii), that requires that there is at most one
supervisory board member who can be considered to be affiliated with a shareholder, or group of
affiliated shareholders, who holds more than 10 per cent of the shares in a company.. Five out of
eight members of NIBC’s Supervisory Board qualify as formally independent. The other three
members are formally not independent, because they are representatives of our shareholder. This
86 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
principle in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code deviates from the policy of the Dutch central
bank (DNB) that came into force in 2012. DNB’s policy is that at least 50% of the members of a
Supervisory Board should be formally independent. NIBC complies with the DNB policy.
In addition, NIBC is not in compliance with best practice provision 2.2.2 that requires that
supervisory board members are reappointed for a period of two years in the event of a
reappointment after an eight-year period. The Company’s Supervisory Board members can be
appointed for a period of four years after an eight-year period, provided that no Supervisory Board
member shall hold office for more than three four-year terms or twelve years, as the case may be.
NIBC is not in compliance with best practice provision 3.4.1 iv that requires the Remuneration
Report to include a discussion of the internal pay ratio. In 2017 the internal annual report 'Harrewijn'
was discussed in the RNC as well as with the Works Council, the report covers internal pay ratios.
As from 2018 onwards NIBC will disclose the relevant elements related to the pay ratios in line with
Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
DUTCH BANKING CODE
The updated Dutch Banking Code came into effect as legislative on 1 January 2015, after a decree by
the Dutch Minister of Finance. The Banking Code is part of a package called ‘Future-oriented
banking’. In addition to the Banking Code, Future-oriented banking introduces a Social Charter and
rules of conduct associated with the Bankers’ Oath and disciplinary rules for employees of banks in
the Netherlands. Before 1 January 2015 the Dutch Banking Code was a form of self-regulation.
The Dutch Banking Code, together with the introduction of the Social Charter and the
implementation of the Bankers' Oath, is applicable to all employees of financial institutions in the
Netherlands. NIBC supports the principles of the Banking Code to regain trust, ensure stability and
protect the interests of our stakeholders.
NIBC has implemented all procedural and operational measures required under the Dutch Banking
Code. Our governance is fully aligned with the Banking Code. We also aligned our remuneration
policies for staff and Managing Board with the Banking Code. Ever since 2010, we are running a
programme for lifelong learning and hold regular training sessions for the Managing Board and the
Supervisory Board, as is required by the Banking Code.
Among other things the Banking Code requires banks to operate in a sound and ethical way. Our
mission, strategy and objectives reflect this; they can be found on our website. Being in line with this
are the NIBC3, our three corporate values: professional, entrepreneurial and inventive. The NIBC3
are the foundation of all our company’s activities, including our products and services, as well as our
general performance, behaviour, attitude and the targets we set for our employees. Integrity is
considered an essential part of the core value 'professional'.
In line and spirit with the Dutch Banking Code, we updated our Code of Conduct in 2017. The Code
of Conduct guides us in the way we work at NIBC. Key themes are: doing the right thing, following
the letter and the spirit of rules and doing what we say. You can find the Code of Conduct including a
one page abbreviation for daily use on our website.
A detailed explanation of the Dutch Banking Code and an overview of NIBC’s compliance with it can
be found on our website.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT
NIBC believes that risk management is at the core of its business culture. NIBC believes that its
approach to risk management results in fast decision-making through an experienced, client-focused
origination team with detailed knowledge of its client portfolio, which allows NIBC to manage its risk
exposure through carefully structured facilities and client-focused restructuring. NIBC’s origination
philosophy is focused on the client relationship, understanding the client’s cash flow and the
availability of collateral. In its corporate client offering, NIBC applies an integrated approach to
managing credit risk by focusing on risk-adjusted returns: NIBC assesses whether a new opportunity
falls within its risk appetite, evaluates commercial and compliance issues prior to engagement with any
particular client, considers credit risk and financial market risk as part of the decision process and
conducts risk assessments prior to making the final lending decision. The ultimate lending decision is
dependent on NIBC’s comfort with the particular client. In its retail client offering, NIBC applies a
conservative approach to new products, such as Buy-to-Let, and uses programme lending for regular
mortgage loans. NIBC also has a highly experienced Restructuring and Distressed Assets (RDA)
department, which is typically engaged at an early stage of client financial distress to limit NIBC’s
potential losses. In addition, NIBC utilises sophisticated modelling tools, such as an internally
developed methodology under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) approach, to model credit
risk.
The primary risk management objective for NIBC is to ensure it takes only well-judged risks, while
ensuring solid capital and liquidity positions. NIBC is primarily exposed to credit and investment risk in
the course of its lending and investment operations, and seeks to manage its interest rate, market,
currency, operational and liquidity risks. NIBC’s risk appetite has been formalised in NIBC’s risk
appetite framework, which consists of a structured approach for managing the risks inherent in
NIBC’s business, taking into account NIBC’s risk-bearing capacity and is subject to approval by the
Supervisory Board. NIBC’s risk management is fully integrated into its planning and control cycle and
its day-to-day business activities at the operational level.
NIBC’s risk appetite framework is comprised of six core values, or pillars:
■ Franchise: it seeks to be a reliable and client-focused bank;
■ Solvency: it seeks to be a creditworthy partner for its clients and other stakeholders;
■ Profitability: its profitability is dependent on its business model and on maintaining its risk profile;
■ Liquidity: it seeks to maintain sufficient and appropriate liquidity at all times;
■ Funding: it seeks to maintain a stable and diverse funding base; and
■ Asset quality: it seeks to align its asset quality with its business objectives.
NIBC measures its performance across these pillars by means of the quantitative and qualitative
elements of its risk appetite framework. This framework helps NIBC to implement and execute its
strategy for sustainable growth.
NIBC’s risk appetite framework has been established across its organisation and incorporated in its
policies, procedures, limits and action plans. NIBC has adopted certain key risk and performance
indicators and other early warning signals that are used by NIBC’s business units to monitor and
control developments in key risk areas.

FRAMEWORK
NIBC relies on a 'three lines of defence' risk management governance model, which provides a
structure to assign risk management activities and responsibilities at various levels throughout its
organisation. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is assigned to the front office and/or
operational departments and constitutes the first line of defence. The risk control functions
(consisting of Risk Management, Legal, Compliance & Regulatory Affairs and other functions) form
the second line of defence and are responsible for initiating risk policy and supervision of risk control
within NIBC. Internal audit forms the third line and is responsible for, among other things, performing
independent audits on the risk appetite framework.

Risk Ownership Risk Control Risk Assurance
To support effective decision-making, the Managing Board has delegated decision-making authority
regarding key risk management focus areas to the following committees, each of which includes at
least two Executive Committee members:
■ The Engagement Committee (the Engagement Committee) is responsible for decision-making
with regard to client engagement and conflicts of interest. This ensures a transparent, ethical and
accurate decision-making process with regard to NIBC’s engagement of clients.
■ The Transaction Committee (the Transaction Committee) is responsible for decision-making on
senior debt transactions, lending and underwriting strategies, and impairments and write-offs.
■ The Investment Committee (the Investment Committee) is responsible for decision-making on
equity, mezzanine and subordinated debt transactions and impairments and revaluations, with a
separate Strategic Investment Committee responsible for strategic investments.
■ The Risk Management Committee (the Risk Management Committee) monitors NIBC’s overall
risk appetite and risk profile. It approves NIBC’s risk management policies and methodologies, sets
portfolio, sub-portfolio and concentration limits, sets programme lending limits for its retail client
offering segment, oversees model validation and monitors model risk, monitors operational, IT,
legal, compliance, regulatory and sustainability risks, approves new product approval requests and
is responsible for monitoring compliance with NIBC’s corporate social responsibility policy.
■ The Asset and Liability Committee (the Asset and Liability Committee) sets and monitors
economic capital and market risk limits, oversees liquidity management and manages NIBC’s
interest rate and currency risk exposures in its banking book.

risk risk
The Supervisory Board supervises, monitors and advises the Managing Board on the risks inherent in
NIBC’s business activities, including the structure and operation of the internal risk management and
control systems and compliance with legislation, regulations and NIBC’s code of conduct. The
Supervisory Board has set up two committees for this purpose: the Risk Policy and Compliance
Committee (the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee) and the Audit Committee (Audit
Committee). The Risk Policy & Compliance Committee advises the Supervisory Board on its
responsibilities relating to NIBC’s risk appetite, risk profile, risk management policies, as well as on
compliance matters. It presents proposals and recommendations, at the request of the Managing
Board or Supervisory Board, or otherwise in accordance with the mandates, on credit, market,
investment, liquidity, operational and compliance/regulatory risks, and any other material risks NIBC is
exposed to. The Audit Committee advises the Supervisory Board on financial reporting and internal
and external audits. One of the elements of NIBC’s risk framework is the application of thorough
anti-money laundering, client due diligence and know-your-client procedures and policies. NIBC
places particular emphasis on active client monitoring on an ongoing basis. Individual client officers
are primarily responsible for the execution of client due diligence onboarding in accordance with
NIBC’s procedures; however, the day-to-day activities relating to onboarding have been outsourced
to the KYC department, which is a separate department within the corporate client offering
segment.
NIBC’s risk management committees are supported by a robust risk management organisation, which
focuses on the daily monitoring and management of the risks NIBC is exposed.
PORTFOLIO AND MAIN RISK TYPES
Within its risk management framework, NIBC identifies the following key risk categories: credit risk,
investment risk, interest rate risk, market risk, currency risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. NIBC is

primarily exposed to credit and investment risk and seeks to manage other risk types in line with its
business strategy. In addition, ensuring sufficient capital adequacy is a key focus area for NIBC.
The table below provides a breakdown of NIBC’s primary risk exposures (representing both drawn

CREDIT RISK
NIBC defines credit risk as the current or potential threat to NIBC’s earnings and capital as a result of
its counterparties’ failure to make payments on time or to otherwise comply with its financial
obligations to NIBC. Credit risk is present in NIBC’s corporate loans, investment loans, lease
receivables, mortgage loans, debt from financial institutions and corporate entities, securitisations,
cash management and derivatives.
Within the corporate client offering, credit risk is monitored by and transaction proposals are
reviewed and approved by the Transaction Committee and the Investment Committee, as applicable.
Within NIBC’s retail client offering, individual loan exposures that fall within NIBC’s programme
lending criteria are not subject to individual approval and credit review, and the credit risk of the
overall portfolio, including portfolio and concentration limits, is monitored by the Risk Management
Committee. The Risk Management Committee determines the programme lending criteria for the
retail client offering and the business teams are authorised to originate retail mortgage loans and Buy-
to-Let mortgage loans in compliance with those programme lending criteria.

Development of Credit Quality
NIBC monitors the credit quality of its loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, which NIBC believes
enables it to take prompt and proactive action to address potentially problematic exposures. NIBC
applies different risk management procedures depending on how credit and counterparty exposures
are categorised:
■ Non-performing exposure: in line with the European Banking Authority (EBA) definition, a borrower
or facility is considered non-performing if that particular borrower is in default or if a performing
forborne facility is extended additional concessions or such forborne facility becomes more than
30 days past due. NIBC’s non-performing portfolio contains the defaulted portfolio and forborne
exposures that have been granted further concessions.
■ Forborne exposure: in line with the EBA definition, a facility is considered to be forborne if the
borrower is facing financial difficulties and NIBC grants a concession to the borrower in respect of
that particular facility, including loans and debt securities. Concessions may only be granted on
individual facilities and include modifications to the terms of a facility to allow the borrower
sufficient debt service capacity to satisfy its obligations without defaulting, or the partial refinancing
94 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT
of a particular facility. Due to the structured nature of NIBC’s credit facilities, NIBC has historically
been willing to grant its borrowers temporary financial concessions in the face of financial
difficulties, which NIBC believes has resulted in NIBC having a larger forborne exposure portfolio
than some of its peers.
■ Defaulted exposure: in line with the CRR/CRD IV definition, NIBC considers a borrower to be in
default when a credit review determines that the borrower is unlikely to pay its obligations in full
or is more than 90 days past due on a material obligation. At that point the entire EAD of the
borrower’s outstanding facilities are classified as defaulted.
■ Impaired exposure: in line with the IFRS definition, facilities are considered impaired if the
Transaction Committee decides to take an impairment charge on a particular facility, at which
CreditQualityFramework
point the entire EAD of that particular facility is classified as impaired.
The figure below presents an overview of NIBC’s defaulted, impaired, non-performing and forborne
exposure assessment methodology.

These exposure categories assist NIBC in identifying exposures that require additional attention.
NIBC monitors certain early warning signals, including poor financial performance that has led to a
request for a covenant waiver or other form of forbearance, in the case of corporate credit facilities,
or the tenor of arrears, in the case of mortgage loans, which allow NIBC to identify and work with its
clients to resolve credit issues early and avoid further deterioration of the relevant asset. The table
below provides an overview of the corporate loans and Dutch residential mortgage loan exposures
that are classified within one or more of the credit quality measures as at 31 December 2017 and

INVESTMENT RISK
Investment risk, as it relates to NIBC’s equity investments, is the risk that the value of NIBC’s
investment will deteriorate. NIBC’s investments include private equity, infrastructure equity and real
estate equity investments, which can be divided into direct and indirect investments. Indirect
investments are those made through funds and direct investments are all other investments and
consist of investments in private and listed common equity securities, preference shares, warrants and
interests in funds managed by NIBC or by third parties over which NIBC does not exercise control.
NIBC’s investment process is based on the following investment risk management principles:
■ NIBC seeks to ensure that investment risk exposures are authorised independently from the
business originators.
■ NIBC performs systematic risk analysis of the investment, with a view to identifying, measuring, and
evaluating all risks.
■ NIBC embeds 'know your customer' principles, corporate social responsibility and customer due
diligence as integral parts of the overall investment process.
Management of investment exposures
Direct equity investments and commitments to third-party funds are required to be approved by the
Investment Committee, while indirect investments are approved by the investment committees of the
relevant funds, subject to the investment guidelines stipulated in the agreements between the
manager of the fund and the investors. NIBC’s equity investment portfolio generally consists of illiquid
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 97
RISK MANAGEMENT
investments. As the size of NIBC’s investment portfolio is limited, NIBC assesses concentration risk
for each individual asset before the investment is made, as well as the market, sector and
geographical exposure profiles. All investment exposures are reviewed by the investment manager on
a quarterly basis, and the results are reported and approved by the Investment Committee. The
investment manager drafts a review document and prepares a valuation of the investment in
accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (Edition
December 2015) and IAS 39. All valuations are approved by the Investment Committee and Risk
Management. The exit strategy for each particular investment is reviewed and updated in each
quarterly review. Divestment proposals for direct investments are submitted for approval to the
Investment Committee while divestment proposals for indirect investments are submitted for
approval to the investment committee of the relevant fund.
Composition of investment exposure
The following table presents the total amounts and the breakdown of the equity investments
portfolio by industry sector and geographic region. NIBC’s off-balance commitments amounted to

INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk refers to the sensitivity of NIBC’s interest income and/or market value to adverse
interest rate movements. When interest rates rise or fall, interest cash flows and/or their present
value also change. Movements in interest rates can therefore have a major impact on both interest
income and NIBC’s market value.
NIBC defines interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) as the risk of losses from interest rate
sensitive positions in non-trading activities due to movements in interest rates. IRRBB is measured and
monitored by the risk management function. NIBC has developed an IRRBB framework, which is
used to measure and monitor IRRBB from both an economic value perspective (impact on economic
value) and from an earnings perspective (impact on net interest income). Any significant breach of
IRRBB limits is required to be reported to the chief risk officer (CRO) immediately.
98 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT
To monitor the impact on economic value, NIBC calculates interest basis point value (BPV) and
interest value at risk (VaR) measures on a daily basis and for review by the market risk department.
To monitor the impact on net interest income, NIBC uses a combination of static and dynamic
(changes to the current portfolio composition) analyses. The dynamic analyses consider NIBC's
strategy by modelling the development of the balance sheet in line with NIBC’s business plan and
taking into account both refinancing and reinvestments. Earnings at risk (EatR) are calculated as the
12-month earnings impact due to a 200 bps gradual upwards or downwards interest rate shift per
currency.
As part of NIBC’s interest rate risk analysis, NIBC considers a set of possible scenarios, including
scenarios intended as stress testing and vulnerability identification, based on historical events and on
possible future events.
NIBC accepts a certain economic value risk exposure in its mismatch book to stabilise earnings,
referred to as the strategic mismatch exposure. Without the strategic mismatch exposure, NIBC
would hedge all of its interest bearing assets to three-month EURIBOR/LIBOR, leading to NIBC’s
non-interest bearing capital effectively financing very short-term assets and the interest return on
NIBC’s non-interest bearing capital fluctuating with these short-term rates earned on those assets.
The mismatch book exclusively contains swaps in EUR, USD and/or GBP. Apart from the mismatch
book, interest rate risk is also present in the remaining banking book: liquidity portfolio, collateral
portfolio, debt investments portfolio, mortgages book and corporate treasury book. The liquidity
portfolio, collateral portfolio and debt investments portfolio consist mostly of investments in financial
institutions and securitisations, while the corporate treasury book contains mainly the funding and the
corporate loans of the bank. The mortgage loan book consists of the 'old' (white label) mortgage
loan portfolio and the closed German residential mortgage loans accounted on fair value and
mortgages originating under the NIBC Direct label accounted on amortised cost.
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates,
exchange rates and share prices, as well as other variables that are not directly observable, such as
volatilities and correlations. NIBC defines market risk as:
■ The risk of losses in the trading book arising from adverse movements in market rates;
■ The risk of losses in the banking book from NIBC’s credit spread risk position and equity positions
(exclusively non-tradable securities);
■ The risk of losses in both the banking and trading book from adverse movements in foreign
currencies.
In the trading book, excluding NIBC Markets, NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and
USD yield curves. The limits for the trading book are moderate and are monitored on a daily basis
and reported to the Asset and Liability Committee on a bi-weekly basis. NIBC’s policy is not to take
any active currency positions. When currency positions exceed small facilitating limits, NIBC’s policy is
to enter into hedging transactions. NIBC’s overall open foreign currency position was EUR 3 million
as at 31 December 2017 (2016: EUR 18 million).
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk (in the trading book only) and
credit spread risk (in both the trading and banking books). The capital requirement for market risk is
based on internal models for the trading book, excluding NIBC Markets, and on the Standardised
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 99
RISK MANAGEMENT
Approach for NIBC Markets. The capital requirement for the overall foreign currency position of the
bank is calculated in accordance with the Standardised Approach.
The objectives of the market risk function are to measure, report and limit the market risk of NIBC
in accordance with NIBC’s market risk framework. NIBC has defined interest rate risk, credit spread
risk and traded equity risk limits and monitors their positions on a daily basis, reporting to the Asset
and Liability Committee once every two weeks. The risk management and control function is
independent of any trading activities. Any significant breach of market risk limits is required to be
reported to the CRO for immediate action. Market risk analyses all 'overshootings' (i.e. occasions
where either the hypothetical or actual profit and loss account exceeds the VaR) in the trading book
and reports them to both the CRO and the DNB in accordance with Article 366 point 5 of the
CRR.
NIBC uses multiple risk metrics to monitor and manage market risk. These include interest BPV,
credit BPV, interest VaR and credit VaR. These metrics are calculated on a daily basis and are
reviewed by the market risk department.
In addition to the VaR, NIBC has developed a number of stress tests. These stress tests consist of
both historical events and potential extreme market conditions. Market risk stress tests are
conducted and reported regularly, both at portfolio level and on a consolidated basis.
CURRENCY RISK
NIBC manages its overall currency position based on the currency positions in the monthly balance
sheets. The main exposures in foreign currencies for NIBC are USD, GBP and JPY. NIBC uses
matched funding and other measures to apply its policy of not taking any currency positions. Any
currency position open at month-end as a result of movements in the fair value of assets or liabilities
or interest income in foreign currencies is typically hedged by entering into foreign exchange rate
spot transactions.
OPERATIONAL RISK
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or
systems, from human error, fraud, or external events including legal risk, compliance risk and
reputational risk.
NIBC’s operational risk management function monitors and controls operational risk, develops
policies and processes to manage operational risk and provides methodology and tools. These tools
enable NIBC to assess whether the operational risk profile of NIBC fits within its operational risk
appetite and provide an integrated view of the operational risk and control self-assessments
performed by all business units and countries, action planning, and event and loss registration and
support the constant process of evaluating and reducing operational risk, and planning mitigation
measures. Furthermore, the operational risk department also coordinates the development of
forward-looking scenario analysis and supports business continuity and information security.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is an entity’s inability to fund its assets and meet its obligations as they become due, at
an acceptable cost. In order to maintain an adequate liquidity position, NIBC has developed a
comprehensive liquidity management framework, which it reviews on an annual basis. In recent years,
100 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
RISK MANAGEMENT
new regulatory requirements have influenced NIBC’s liquidity policies. NIBC aims to be an early
adopter of such regulatory developments.
NIBC monitors its liquidity position on an ongoing basis. The funding profile is analysed by aggregating
all assets and liabilities based on their maturities. NIBC prepares and presents several liquidity stress
tests to the Asset and Liability Committee once every two weeks. The stress tests are amongst
others based on projections prepared by the business units, the current asset and liability maturity
profiles and a liquidity stress policy, which is reviewed by the Asset and Liability Committee on a
yearly basis.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY
The principal ratios for reviewing NIBC’s capital adequacy are the CRR/CRD IV capital ratios: the
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Tier 1 ratio and the Total Capital/BIS ratio. CRR/CRD IV standards
are in effect as of January 2014.
As in previous years, NIBC is solidly capitalised at 31 December 2017, displayed by our solid
regulatory ratios. The fully-loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 21.4% (Common Equity Tier
1 ratio 31 December 2016: 16.8%); the Tier 1 ratio at 23.7% (31 December 2016: 16.8%); and the
Total Capital / BIS ratio at 27.2% (31 December 2016: 21.3%). These are well above the minimum
capital requirements imposed by the CRR/CRD IV, which require a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 6% and a
minimum Total Capital / BIS ratio of 8%, excluding capital buffers. The ratios increased compared to
2016 because of increase in the Common Equity Tier 1 capital and substantial decrease in Risk
Weighted Assets (RWA). Of the total capital requirement, 88% relates to credit risk, 9% to
operational risk, 2% to market risk and 1% credit value adjustment. The following table shows the
summary of capital ratios and RWA for NIBC. The increase in 2017 of RWAs relating to operational
risk is based on the calculation by means of the standardised approach and mainly reflects the
improved profitability of NIBC.

Economic capital
In addition to regulatory capital, NIBC also calculates Economic Capital (EC). EC is the amount of
capital that NIBC needs as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based on its own
assessment of risks. It differs from Basel’s regulatory capital, as NIBC assesses the specific risk
characteristics of its business activities in a different manner than the required regulatory method. At
NIBC, EC is based on a one-year risk horizon with a 99.9% confidence level. This confidence level
means that there is a probability of 0.1% that losses in a period of one year will be larger than the
allocated EC.

IN CONTROL REPORT
IN CONTROL REPORT
The responsibilities of the Managing Board are anchored in the
principles of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financiële
toezicht) and other regulations. These responsibilities include compliance
with relevant legislation and the implementation and operation of risk
management and control systems. These management and control
systems aim to ensure reliable financial reporting and to control
downside risk to the operational and financial objectives of NIBC.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL
Managing Board has made an assessment of the effectiveness of NIBC’s internal control and risk
management systems. Based on this assessment and to the best of its knowledge, the Managing
Board states that:
■ there have been no material failings in the effectiveness of NIBC’s internal risk management and
control systems;
■ NIBC’s internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that NIBC
Bank N.V.’s Annual Report does not contain any errors of material importance;
■ there is a reasonable expectation that NIBC Bank N.V. will be able to continue in operation and
meet its liabilities for at least twelve months, as evidenced by the details included in 'performance
evaluation', therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements;
■ there are no material risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the continuity of NIBC Bank N.V.’s enterprise in the coming twelve months.
It should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide
absolute assurance as to the realization of operational and strategic business objectives, or that they
can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules
and regulations. Nor can they provide certainty that we will achieve our objectives.
In view of the above, the Managing Board of NIBC believes it is in compliance with the requirements
of best pratice provision 1.2.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
In respect of Article 5:25c, Section 2 (c) (1 and 2) of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the
members of the Managing Board of NIBC hereby confirm, to the best of their knowledge, that:
■ The annual company and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and income statement of NIBC and its consolidated group companies;
■ The report of the Managing Board gives a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet
date and developments during the financial year of NIBC and its consolidated group companies; 
■ The report of the Managing Board describes the material risks which NIBC faces.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying
NIBC’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements section.
Changes in accounting policies in 2017
Changes in IFRS-EU
The following new or revised standards, amendments or interpretations were implemented by NIBC
on 1 January 2017:
■ Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses
The IASB issued the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes to clarify the accounting for deferred
tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. The amendments
clarify that an entity needs to consider whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits
against which it may make deductions on the reversal of that deductible temporary difference.
Furthermore, the amendments provide guidance on how an entity should determine future
taxable profits and explain the circumstances in which taxable profit may include the recovery of
some assets for more than their carrying amount.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Amendments to IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative
The amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows are part of the IASB’s Disclosure Initiative and
help users of financial statements better understand changes in an entity’s debt. The amendments
require entities to provide disclosures about changes in their liabilities arising from financing
activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign
exchange gains or losses). Application of the amendments will result in additional disclosures
provided by NIBC.
■ Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle
This cycle of improvements contains amendments to three standards of which two are relevant for
NIBC. These are IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in
Associates and Joint Venture. Only the amendment related to IFRS 12 became effective as from
1 January 2017 and does not have significant impact on NIBC's Annual report. The amendment
related to IAS 28 becomes effective as from 1 January 2018 and is described in section ‘Upcoming
changes after 2017’.
The changes in IFRS-EU listed above have not led to changes in NIBC’s accounting policies and do
not have a material impact on the position and performance of NIBC. In addition, NIBC did not have
any other reasons to change its accounting policies.
Upcoming changes after 2017
New and/or amended standards not yet effective
The following new accounting standards, amendments and/or interpretations are issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU, but are not yet effective.
The new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations are required to be applied as from
1 January 2018. Note that only the amendments to IFRSs that are relevant for NIBC are discussed
below.
■ IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
As from 1 January 2018, the current IFRS standard for financial instruments (IAS 39) will be
replaced by IFRS 9. Changes contain three main topics: classification and measurement of financial
instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. As from 1 January 2016, NIBC
has already early adopted the own credit requirements introduced by IFRS 9 in isolation. The own
credit requirements entail changes in the fair value attributable to changes in credit risk of the
financial liabilities designated at Fair Value through Profit or Lose (FVTPL) to be recognised in Other
Comprehensive Income. (OCI)
Classification and measurement of financial instruments
In 2017 the business model blueprint has been finalised, which was used to determine the
classification under IFRS 9. Following the determination of business models, transactions to be
recognised at amortised cost have been reviewed to ensure the contractual cash flow characteristics
meet the requirement to solely consist of payments of principal and interest (SPPI). An analysis of the
cash flow characteristics of the relevant financial assets has been executed. The business model
selection and SPPI test have been performed on groups of assets that have a set of similar
characteristics resulting in a homogenous population. Process adjustments to ensure an adequate
governance and ongoing compliance with IFRS 9 have been identified will be further embedded and
refined in 2018.
116 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Impact
Except for the reclassification effect of mortgage loans designated at FVTPL to amortised cost, NIBC
notes there is a limited impact on equity related to changes in classification. The reclassification effect
of mortgage loans designated at FVTPL to amortised cost is EUR 321 million, which is the result of
revoking the previous fair value designation and consequently is equal to the fair value of the relevant
mortgage loans designated at FVTPL as per 31 December 2017. The impact was primarily driven by
market interest rates as these have had a material impact on the fair value development of the
portfolio. The reclassification effect of mortgage loans designated at FVTPL to amortised cost on the
regulatory capital leads to a decrease of the fully loaded CET 1 ratio of NIBC of approximately 3.6%-
points at 1 January 2018.
Impairment of financial assets
Key elements to measure expected credit losses (ECL) are the staging triggers within the 'three-stage'
model and the incorporation of forward looking information.
'Three-stage' model
NIBC is required to recognise an allowance depending on whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk since initial recognition or the financial asset was credit-impaired on initial
recognition. A key assessment is, therefore, whether a significant deterioration in the credit risk of a
financial asset occurred between initial recognition and maturity. The guiding principle of the
Excpected Credit Loss (ECL) model is to reflect the general pattern of deterioration or improvement
in the credit quality of financial assets. The amount of ECLs recognised as a loss allowance or
provision depends on the extent of credit deterioration since initial recognition. In general, there are
two measurement bases:
1. 12-month ECLs (stage 1), which apply to all items (from initial recognition) as long as there is no
significant deterioration in credit quality; and
2. Lifetime ECLs, which apply when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred on an individual
or collective basis (stage 2) or when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events that occurred before or after the initial recognition of the financial asset (stage 3).
The appropriate stage is determined by performing an assessment based on staging triggers. The
staging triggers contain one of the following elements:
1. A quantitative element (i.e. reflecting a quantitative comparison of Probability of Default (PD) at
the reporting date and PD at initial recognition);
2. A qualitative element (e.g. expert judgement); and
3. 'Backstop' indicators (i.e. measures of last resort if other indicators are not available, e.g. the '90
days past due' rebuttable presumption).
NIBC uses both the quantitative element and the qualitative element to determine significant
increases in credit risk, as the assessment can be based on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative
information. Examples of used triggers are increase of lifetime PD since initial recognition, days past
due, forborne, watch list and other internal and external ratings methods. In certain circumstances,
qualitative and non-statistical quantitative information may be sufficient to determine that a financial
asset has met the criterion for the recognition of lifetime ECLs. That is, the information does not
need to flow through a statistical model or credit ratings process in order to determine whether
there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of the financial asset.
Special attention has been given to the definition of stage 2 assets and the interaction of the IFRS 9
criteria of significant increased credit risk with the existing credit quality framework of NIBC.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 117
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Incorporation of forward looking information
Estimating ECL requires, amongst others, considerations of multiple forward-looking scenarios,
whereby the final ECL is an average of the ECLs calculated under the different scenarios. In line with
market developments, NIBC uses three scenarios: base, downturn and benign; updated semi-annually,
NIBC developed a model that translates the forecasted developments of macro-economic factors
into portfolio-specific point-in-time PD and Loss Given Default (LGD) changes and consequently into
ECL developments. In 2018, NIBC will continue to re-assess and update all forward-looking
assumptions used in the model.
In 2017, the aforementioned key decisions were implemented into ECL models and risk management
processes. All relevant ECL models have been validated by a third party. Furthermore risk and finance
processes and systems have been adjusted to support the required ECL-calculations, administrative
processing and reporting. In 2018, NIBC will continue to refine and further improve all related
processes.
Impact
Based on ECL calculations NIBC considers the increase in the total level of impairment allowance to
be moderate as compared to the fully loaded CET 1 ratio of NIBC at 1 January 2018. Following the
transition to IFRS 9, a more volatile impairment charge is expected on the back of macroeconomic
predictions.
With the introduction of IFRS 9, NIBC will no longer report incurred but not reported (IBNR)
impairment losses. This will partially offset the impact of ECL impairment allowances.
Hedge accounting
IFRS 9 allows entities to continue with the hedge accounting under IAS 39 after 1 January 2018.
NIBC decided to continue applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting (IAS 39 AG126a).
Reporting
IFRS 9 introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These will change
the nature and extent of NIBC’s disclosures about its financial instruments particularly in the year of
the application of the new standard.
The information provided in this note is focused upon material items, consequently it does not
represent a complete list of expected adjustments.
■ IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers'
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (IFRS 15) becomes effective as of 2018. IFRS 15
provides more specific guidance on recognising revenue on other than insurance contracts and
financial instruments. Based upon NIBC’s analysis IFRS 15 will not have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
■ IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (IFRS 16) becomes effective as of 2019. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise most
leases on their balance sheets. NIBC does not expect IFRS 16 to have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
■ Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 15 to address several implementation issues discussed by
the Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition. The amendments have an effective
118 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
date of 1 January 2018, which is the effective date of IFRS 15. NIBC does not expect IFRS 15 to
have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
■ Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle
This cycle of improvements contains amendments to three standards of which two are relevant for
NIBC. These are IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in
Associates and Joint Venture which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2017 (see section 'Upcoming changes after 2017') and 1 January 2018 respectively. Both
amendments do not have significant impact on NIBC's Annual report.
New and/or amended standards not yet endorsed
The following new or revised standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB, but are not
yet endorsed by the European Union and are therefore not open for early adoption. Note that only
the amendments to IFRSs that are relevant for NIBC are discussed below.
■ Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the
effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment
transaction; the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for
withholding tax obligations; and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a
share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled. The
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. NIBC is
assessing the potential effect of the amendments on its consolidated financial statements.
■ IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
The interpretation clarifies that in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition
of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary
asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the
date on which an entity initially recognises the nonmonetary asset or non-monetary liability arising
from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the
entity must determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance
consideration. The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2018. NIBC is assessing the potential impact.
■ Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment property
The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under
construction or development into, or out of investment property. The amendments state that a
change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment
property and there is evidence of the change in use. A mere change in management’s intentions
for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use. The amendments are
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. NIBC is assessing the potential
impact.
■ IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 
The interpretation clarifies application of the recognition and measurement in IAS 12 Income
Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. NIBC is assessing the potential impact.
■ Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 that addresses that prepayable financial assets that would
otherwise meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’(SPPI) criterion would be eligible to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 119
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
be measured at amortised or fair value through other comprehensive income –subject to the
business model assessment – if the following conditions are met: the instrument is inconsistent
with the SPPI-criterion only because the party that chooses (or causes) to terminate the contract
early may receive reasonable additional compensation for doing so (fist eligibility condition); and
the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant on initial recognition of the financial asset
(second eligibility condition). NIBC does not expect these amendments to IFRS 9 to have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
■ Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
The proposed amendments to IAS 28 clarify that companies account for long-term interests in an
associate or joint venture -to which the equity method is not applied- using IFRS 9 ‘Financial
Instruments’. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January
2019. NIBC is assessing the potential impact.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of NIBC and its
subsidiaries as at and for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016.
Subsidiaries
The group’s subsidiaries are those entities (including structured entities) which it directly or indirectly
controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by the group’s ability to exercise its power in order to
affect any variable returns that the group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity. The
group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored
by third parties for a variety of reasons, including allowing customers to hold investments in separate
legal entities, allowing customers to invest jointly in alternative assets, for asset securitisation
transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection.
When assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the group evaluates a range of control factors,
namely:
■ the purpose and design of the entity;
■ the relevant activities and how these are determined;
■ whether the group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities;
■ whether the group has exposure or rights to variable returns;
■ whether the group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Where voting rights are relevant, the group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or
indirectly, more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another
investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities, as indicated by one or
more of the following factors:
■ another investor has the power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement
with the group; or
■ another investor has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee
under a statute or an agreement; or
■ another investor has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board
of directors or equivalent governing body and the investee is controlled by that board or body; or
■ another investor has the power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors
or equivalent governing body and control of that entity is by this board or body.
Potential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.
Likewise, the group also assesses the existence of control where it does not control the majority of
120 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise
in circumstances where the size and dispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the group the
power to direct the activities of the investee.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and are
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The group reassesses the consolidation status at least at each financial reporting date. Therefore, any
changes in the structure leading to a change in one or more of the control factors require
reassessment when they occur. This includes changes in decision making rights, changes in contractual
arrangements, changes in the financing, ownership or capital structure as well as changes following a
trigger event which was anticipated in the original documentation.
The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages,
the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquire is re-
measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement
are recognised in the income statement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,
the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquired entity and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference
is recognised directly in the income statement presented under other operating income as negative
goodwill. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for
within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognised in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of
impairment of the assets transferred. The accounting policies of subsidiaries (including structured
entities that the bank consolidates) have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the accounting policies adopted by NIBC.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions, that is as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling
interests are also recorded in equity.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 121
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Disposal of subsidiaries
When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured at its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income
statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting
for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if
the group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This may mean that amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement
(investment income).
Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control. Significant
influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also
is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not
limited to one or more of the following:
■ Representation in the board of directors;
■ Participation in the policymaking process;
■ Interchange of managerial personnel.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The group’s share of post-acquisition results of associates and joint ventures is recognised in the
income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is
recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount
of the investment in associates and joint ventures. When the group’s share of losses in an associate
and joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate and joint venture, the group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on
behalf of the associate or joint venture.
The group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are, except as otherwise described below,
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a
joint venture is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to
recognise the group’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture after the date of
acquisition. The group’s investment in associates or joint ventures includes goodwill identified on
acquisition. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of
the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The group determines at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the
investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the
amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint
venture and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to investment income (sub line
item share in result of associates) in the income statement.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associate or joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses
are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
122 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
If the interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate
share of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the
income statement, where appropriate.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the group
measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the income
statement. If applicable, dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in
the income statement.
With effect from 1 January 2007, all newly acquired investments in associates and joint ventures held
by venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds (as that term is used in IAS 28 and IFRS
11) that qualify as a joint venture or associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value
through profit or loss. Interests held by the group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and
investment funds that are managed on a fair value basis are also accounted for as investments held at
fair value through profit or loss.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segment, has been identified as the Managing
Board of NIBC. For details of NIBC’s operating segments see note 1.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, the functional currency and
presentation currency of NIBC.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement,
except when deferred in equity (other comprehensive income net of tax) as qualifying net investment
hedges.
Changes in the fair value of monetary loans denominated in foreign currency that are classified as
available for sale are analysed between foreign exchange translation differences and other changes in
the carrying amount of the loan. Foreign exchange translation differences are recognised in the
income statement and other changes in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive
income.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 123
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Foreign exchange translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair
value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences
on non-monetary items classified as available for sale assets are included in the revaluation reserve in
other comprehensive income.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
■ Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;
■ Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates
of the transactions);
■ All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other
comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments,
are taken to shareholder’s equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, or partially disposed of,
such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Recognition of financial instruments
A financial instrument is recognised in the balance sheet when NIBC becomes a party to the
contractual provisions that comprise the financial instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans and receivables and mortgage loans at fair
value through P&L, are initially recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that NIBC becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way trades: purchases or sales of
financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation
or convention in the market place. Loans and advances and mortgage loans at fair value through P&L
are recognised when funds are transferred to the customers’ account. NIBC recognises due to
customer balances when funds reach NIBC.
Forward purchases and sales other than those requiring delivery within the time frame established by
regulation or market convention are treated as derivative forward contracts.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) are derecognised when:
■ The rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired; or
■ When NIBC has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows of the financial assets,
and either:
■ substantially all risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or
■ substantially all risks and rewards have neither been retained nor transferred but control is not
retained.
124 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If NIBC has transferred its contractual rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither
transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor transferred control of
the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of NIBC’s continuing involvement in the asset.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration
that NIBC could be required to repay.
When continuing involvement takes the form of a written and/or purchased option (including a cash-
settled option or similar provision) on the transferred asset, the extent of NIBC’s continuing
involvement is the amount of the transferred asset that NIBC may repurchase, except that in the case
of a written put option (including a cash-settled option or similar provision) on an asset measured at
fair value, the extent of NIBC’s continuing involvement is limited to the lower of the fair value of the
transferred asset and the option exercise price.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or
expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification
is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the
difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Classification of financial instruments
Financial assets are classified as:
■ Loans and receivables at amortised cost;
■ Available for sale financial instruments; or
■ Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss which include:
■ financial assets held for trading;
■ financial assets that NIBC irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value
through profit or loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are
managed on the basis of its fair value or include terms that have substantive derivative
characteristics in nature.
Financial liabilities are classified as:
■ Financial instruments at amortised cost; or
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss which include:
■ financial liabilities held for trading;
■ financial liabilities that NIBC has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value
through profit or loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are
managed on the basis of its fair value or include terms that have substantive derivative
characteristics in nature.
The measurement and income recognition in the income statement depend on the IFRS classification
of the financial asset or liability. The classification of financial instruments, except for the financial
assets reclassified in 2008, is determined upon initial recognition.
Loans and receivables at amortised cost
Loans and receivables at amortised cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments that are (upon recognition) not quoted in an active market, other than:
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 125
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ those that NIBC intends to sell immediately or in the short term, which are classified as held for
trading;
■ those that NIBC upon initial recognition designates at fair value through profit or loss;
■ those that NIBC upon initial recognition designates at available for sale;
■ those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than
because of credit deterioration.
An interest acquired in a pool of assets that are not loans and receivables (for example an interest in
a mutual fund or similar fund) is not a loan or receivable.
The main classes of loans and receivables at amortised cost at 31 December 2017 include corporate
lending (excluding commercial real estate and leverage loan warehouses, secondary loan trading and
distressed asset trading), mortgage loans at own book and investments in the EU Corporate Credits
and EU Structured Credits portfolio that were reclassified in 2008.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs,
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (including
interest accruals less provision for impairment).
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for
sale and are not classified as (a) loans and receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments or (c)
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The main classes of financial instruments designated as available for sale assets at 31 December 2017
include:
■ Equity investments;
■ Certain debt investments that do not meet the definition of loans and receivables;
■ EU most subordinated notes.
Available for sale financial assets are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time but may be
sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and are
subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised directly in the revaluation
reserve in other comprehensive income until the financial instrument is derecognised or impaired.
When available for sale investments are sold, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as net trading income or investment
income (sub line item gains less losses from financial assets).
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign currency gains and losses on
monetary instruments classified as available for sale are recognised in the income statement as
interest and similar income and net trading income respectively. Dividends on available for sale
financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as investment income (sub line item
dividend income) when NIBC’s right to receive payment is established.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two subcategories: financial instruments held for trading and financial instruments
designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
126 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial instruments held for trading
A financial instrument is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for the
purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near future with the objective of generating a profit from
short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading
unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
The measurement of these financial instruments is initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken to
the income statement. Subsequently, their fair value is re-measured, and all gains and losses from
changes therein are recognised in the income statement in net trading income as they arise.
Financial instruments designated upon initial recognition as fair value through
profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out
below, and provided they are so designated by management. NIBC may designate financial
instruments at fair value when the designation:
■ Eliminates or significantly reduces valuation or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise
arise from measuring financial assets or financial liabilities, or recognising gains and losses on them,
on different bases. Under this criterion, the main classes of financial instruments designated by
NIBC at fair value through profit or loss are: Residential mortgage loans (own book and
securitised) originated before 1 January 2013, certain Debt investment portfolios, Equity
investments (including investments in associates and joint ventures held by our venture capital
organisation), and certain Fixed-rate long-term debt securities issued after 1 January 2007;
■ Applies to groups of financial assets, financial liabilities or combinations thereof that are managed,
and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk
management or investment strategy, and where information on the groups of financial instruments
is reported to management on that basis. Under this criterion, the main classes of financial
instruments designated by NIBC at fair value through profit or loss are: Equity investments
(originated after 1 January 2007), Commercial real estate loans (originated before 1 July 2007),
Leveraged loan warehouses, Secondary loan trading and Distressed asset trading. NIBC has
documented risk management and investment strategies designed to manage such assets at fair
value, taking into consideration the relationship of assets to liabilities in a way that mitigates market
risks. Reports are provided to management on the fair value of the assets;
■ Relates to financial instruments containing one or more embedded derivatives that significantly
modify the cash flows resulting from those financial instruments. Under this criterion, the main
classes of financial instruments designated by NIBC at fair value through profit or loss are: Debt
securities in issue structured and Subordinated liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value designation, once made, is irrevocable.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction
with designated financial assets or liabilities are included in net trading income.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (comprising the categories described above)
are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value and all changes in fair value are reported in the income
statement, either as net trading income or as investment income. Interest is recorded in interest
income using the effective interest rate method, while dividend income is recorded in investment
income (sub line item dividend income) when NIBC’s right to receive payment is established.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 127
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial liabilities
With the exception of those financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, these
are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method (including interest accruals) with the periodic amortisation
recorded in the income statement.
The main classes of financial liabilities at amortised cost include amounts due to other banks, deposits
from (corporate and retail) customers, own debt securities in issue under the European Medium
Term Note programme, Covered Bonds and debt securities in issue related to securitised mortgages.
The main classes of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss include debt
securities in issue structured that consist of notes issued with embedded derivatives and derivative
financial liabilities held for trading and used for hedging.
NIBC classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the
substance of the contractual terms of the instrument. NIBC Bank's perpetual bonds are not
redeemable by the holders but bear an entitlement to distributions that is not at the discretion of
NIBC Bank. Accordingly, they are presented as a financial liability.
Preference shares, which are mandatorily redeemable on a specific date, are classified as liabilities.
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest
expense.
Subordinated liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Subordinated liabilities without embedded derivatives are subsequently measured at amortised cost;
any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method.
Subordinated liabilities containing one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the
cash flows are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Own credit requirements IFRS 9 (early adopted in isolation as from 1 January 2016)
Where a financial liability is designated at fair value through profit or loss, the movement in fair value
attributable to changes in the NIBC’s own credit quality is calculated by determining the changes in
credit spreads above observable market interest rates and is presented separately in other
comprehensive income.
Reclassification
In accordance with the amendment to IAS 39: ‘Reclassifications of Financial Assets’, NIBC may
reclassify certain non-derivative financial assets held for trading to either the loans and receivables or
available for sale categories. The amendment also allows for the transfer of certain non-derivative
financial assets from available for sale to loans and receivables.
NIBC is allowed to reclassify certain financial assets out of the held for trading category if they are no
longer held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term.
The amendment distinguishes between those financial assets which would be eligible for classification
as loans and receivables and those which would not. The former are those instruments which have
fixed or determinable payments, are not quoted in an active market and contain no features that
could cause the holder not to recover substantially all of its initial investment, except through credit
deterioration.
128 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial assets that are not eligible for classification as loans and receivables may be transferred from
held for trading to available for sale only in rare circumstances arising from a single event that is
unusual and highly unlikely to recur in the near term.
Financial assets that would now meet the criteria to be classified as loans and receivables may be
transferred from held for trading or available for sale to loans and receivables if the Group has the
intention and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future.
Reclassifications are recorded at the fair value of financial asset as of the reclassification date. The fair
value at the date of reclassification becomes the new cost or amortised cost as applicable. Gains or
losses due to changes in the fair value of the financial asset recognised in the income statement prior
to reclassification date are not reversed. Effective interest rates for financial assets reclassified to the
loans and receivables category are determined at the reclassification date as the discount rate
applicable to amortise the fair value back to expected future cash flows at that date. Subsequent
increases in estimated future cash flows will result in a prospective adjustment to the effective interest
rate applied.
For financial assets reclassified from available for sale to loans and receivables, previous changes in fair
value that have been recognised in the revaluation reserve within other comprehensive income are
amortised to the income statement over the remaining life of the asset using the effective interest
rate method. If such assets are subsequently determined to be impaired, the balance of losses
previously recognised in other comprehensive income is released to the income statement and, if
necessary, additional impairment losses are recorded in the income statement to the extent they
exceed the remaining (available for sale) revaluation reserve in equity (other comprehensive income).
Reclassification of financial assets (as of 1 July 2008)
As of 1 July 2008, the effective date of the amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7, the following financial
assets were reclassified:
■ Loans and receivables: loans and receivables, except for those that were designated at fair value
through profit or loss, were reclassified out of the available for sale category to loans and
receivables at amortised cost; and
■ Debt investments:
■ US Structured Credits were reclassified out of the held for trading category to loans and
receivables at amortised cost to the extent the assets meet the definition of loans and
receivables;
■ EU Structured Credits originated after 1 July 2007 were reclassified out of the available for sale
category to loans and receivables at amortised cost to the extent the assets meet the definition
of loans and receivables; EU Corporate Credits and
■ EU Structured Credits originated before 1 July 2007 were reclassified out of the held for trading
category to loans and receivables at amortised cost to the extent the assets meet the definition
of loans and receivables;
■ EU Collateralised Debt Obligation (CDO) equity was reclassified out of the held for trading
category to the available for sale category. Any subsequent change in fair value from the fair
value at the date of reclassification will be recorded in the (available for sale) revaluation
reserve unless it is determined to be impaired or until the instrument is derecognised.
The amendments to IFRS 7 regarding reclassifications require disclosure of the impact of the
reclassification of each category of financial assets on the financial position and performance of NIBC.
The information provided as of the reclassification date relates only to financial assets remaining on
the balance sheet as of the reporting date 31 December 2017.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 129
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Changes to the classification of financial assets
NIBC made the following changes:
■ In 2007: Loans and receivables: loans and receivables originated before 1 July 2007 are accounted
for at fair value through profit or loss (mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and leveraged
loan warehouses, secondary loan trading, and distressed asset trading) or available for sale (all
other corporate lending). With the exception of mortgage loans, loans originated after 1 July 2007
are classified as loans and receivables at amortised cost. These loans were initially measured at fair
value plus directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method. The reason for this change in classification is to align with
market practice.
■ In the years after 2012 newly originated mortgages are classified as amortised cost;
■ Debt investments (assets): with effect from 1 July 2007, newly originated assets in the EU
structured credits books were classified as available for sale.
■ Assets acquired before 1 July 2007 were classified as held for trading. The reason for this change in
classification is to align with market practice;
■ Equity investments in associates and joint ventures: with effect from 1 January 2007, all newly
acquired investments in associates and joint ventures held by the venture capital organisation (as
that term is used in IAS 28 and IFRS 11) have been designated at fair value through profit or loss.
Previously acquired investments in associates, where material, were accounted for using the equity
method and investments in joint ventures were proportionally consolidated. The reason for this
change in classification is to align with market practice;
■ Equity investments: equity investments acquired before 1 January 2007 held in the Investment
portfolio of the venture capital organisation are classified as available for sale assets in the
consolidated balance sheet. With effect from 1 January 2007, all newly acquired equity investments
held by the venture capital organisation are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss. The reason for this change in classification is to align with market
practice.
Changes to the classification of financial liabilities
In 2007, a change was made to the classification of certain financial liabilities (debt securities in issue)
upon origination. During the period commencing 1 January 2007, plain vanilla fixed-rate long-term
debt securities (liabilities) were issued together with matching interest rate swaps as part of a
documented interest rate risk management strategy. An accounting mismatch would arise if the debt
securities in issue were accounted for at amortised cost because the related derivatives are measured
at fair value with movements in the fair value through the income statement. By designating the long-
term debt as fair value through profit or loss, the movement in the fair value of the long-term debt
will also be recorded in the income statement, and thereby offset the gains and/or losses on the
derivative instrument that is also included in the income statement.
As from 2008, newly issued funding is classified as amortised costs, unless an accounting mismatch
with related derivatives would arise or if embedded derivatives are involved. Then the debt securities
are classified as fair value.
Fair value estimation
IFRS 13 requires for financial instruments and non-financial instruments that are measured at fair
value in the balance sheet disclosure of each class of financial assets and liabilities within a three-level
hierarchy, referring to the respective basis of fair value measurement as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
130 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
Determination of fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell or paid to transfer a
particular asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which NIBC has access at
that date. NIBC determines fair value either by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price
quotations without adjustment for transaction costs for those financial instruments that are currently
traded in an active market. The fair value measurement is based upon the bid price for financial assets
and the ask price for financial liabilities. These financial instruments are reported as level 1 in the fair
value hierarchy.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and
regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s
length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.
The fair value of financial instruments not quoted in an active market is determined using appropriate
valuation techniques. These valuation techniques are applied using, where possible, relevant market
observable inputs (level 2) or unobservable inputs (level 3). Valuation techniques include the
discounted cash flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which market observable prices
exist, option pricing models, credit models and other relevant models.
Certain financial instruments are recorded at fair value using valuation techniques in which current
market transactions or observable market data are not available. Their fair value is determined using a
valuation technique based on NIBC’s best estimate of the most appropriate assumptions and that has
been calibrated against actual market transactions. Outcomes are adjusted to reflect the spread for
bid and ask prices, to reflect costs to close out positions, where necessary for counterparty credit
and liquidity spread, and for any other limitations in the technique. Profit or loss, calculated upon
initial recognition (day one profit or loss), is deferred unless the calculation is based on market
observable inputs, in which case it is immediately recognised. Deferred day one profit or loss is
amortised to income over the contractual life until maturity or settlement.
The fair value of on demand deposits from customers is not less than the amount payable on
demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.
The level within the fair value hierarchy at which an instrument measured at fair value is categorised is
determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement of fair value
in its entirety.
NIBC recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.
See note 44 for an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how
they are measured.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 131
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Recognition of day one profit or loss
The best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is the transaction price (that is, the fair value of
the consideration given or received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by
comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (that is,
without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only
data from observable markets.
NIBC has entered into transactions where fair value is determined using valuation models for which
not all inputs are market observable prices or rates. Such financial instruments are initially recognised
at the transaction price, which is the best indicator of fair value, although the value obtained from the
relevant valuation model may differ. Significant differences between the transaction price and the
model value, commonly referred to as day one profit or loss, are not recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Deferred day one profit or losses are amortised to income over the life until maturity or settlement.
The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value as determined by the relevant model
adjusted for any deferred day one profit or loss.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value
The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for
disclosure purposes of those financial instruments which are not recorded at fair value in the financial
statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying amount
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than three months), it
is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate fair value. This assumption is also applied to
demand deposits from customers and customer savings with a specific maturity.
Fixed-rate financial instruments
The fair values of Fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by
comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates for
similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed-interest bearing deposits is based on
discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk
and maturity. For quoted debt issued, the fair values are determined based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model
is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity
and on credit spreads. For other variable rate instruments, an adjustment is also made to reflect the
change in required credit spread since initial recognition.
See note 44 for the fair values of NIBC’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the
balance sheet.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when,
and only when, NIBC has currently a legally enforceable right to set-off the amounts and the group
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS.
132 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Collateral
The group enters into master agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) with counterparties
whenever possible and when appropriate. Master agreements provide that, if the master agreement is
being terminated as a consequence of an event of default or termination event, all outstanding
transactions with the counterparty will fall due and all amounts outstanding will be settled on a net
basis. In the case of a CSA with counterparties, the group has the right to obtain collateral for the net
counterparty exposure.
The group obtains collateral in respect of counterparty liabilities when this is considered appropriate.
The collateral normally takes the form of a pledge over the counterparty’s assets and gives the group
a claim on these assets for both existing and future liabilities.
The group also pays and receives collateral in the form of cash or securities in respect of other credit
instruments, such as derivative contracts, in order to reduce credit risk. Collateral paid or received in
the form of cash together with the underlying is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Any
interest payable or receivable arising is recorded as interest expense or interest income respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
NIBC uses derivative financial instruments both for trading and hedging purposes. NIBC uses
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks and
to credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured, and are subsequently re-measured, at fair value.
The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is obtained from quoted market prices. Fair values of
over-the-counter derivatives are obtained using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow
models and option pricing models.
The method of recognising fair value gains and losses depends on whether the derivatives are held
for trading or are designated as hedging instruments and if the latter, the nature of the risks being
hedged. All gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are
recognised in the income statement in net trading income.
When derivatives are designated as hedges, NIBC classifies them as either (i) a fair value hedge of
interest rate risk (‘portfolio fair value hedges’); (ii) a fair value hedge of interest rate risk or foreign
exchange rate risk (‘micro fair value hedges’) (iii) a cash flow hedge of the variability of highly
probable cash flows (‘cash flow hedges’) Hedge accounting is applied to derivatives designated as
hedging instruments, provided certain criteria are met.
Hedge accounting
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the criteria
specified in IAS 39, NIBC applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging
of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate, to the risks being hedged.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, NIBC documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking the
hedge. NIBC also requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether or not the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in
offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.
Interest on designated qualifying hedges is included in net interest income.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 133
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NIBC discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
■ It is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
■ The derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised;
■ The hedged item matures, or is sold or repaid;
■ A forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable; or
■ It voluntarily decides to discontinue the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting and fair value hedge accounting on a micro level.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging
instruments are recorded in the income statement in net trading income together with changes in the
fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk.
If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative fair value
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over
the remaining period to maturity using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is
derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income
statement in net trading income.
Portfolio fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk arising on portfolios of
fixed-interest rate corporate loans (classified as available for sale financial assets or as amortised cost
assets), to portfolios of plain vanilla fixed-interest rate funding (liabilities classified as amortised cost)
and to the residual interest rate risk from retail deposits and mortgages.
In order to apply portfolio fair value hedge accounting, the cash flows arising on the portfolios are
scheduled into time buckets based upon when the cash flows are expected to occur. For the first
two years, cash flows are scheduled using monthly time buckets; thereafter annual time buckets are
used. Hedging instruments are designated for each time bucket, together with an amount of assets or
liabilities that NIBC is seeking to hedge. Designation and de-designation of hedging relationships is
undertaken on a monthly basis, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging
relationship at a portfolio level, across all time buckets.
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item.
Micro fair value hedge
NIBC applies micro fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk and/or the foreign exchange
risk arising from debt investments at available for sale and fixed-interest rate funding.
(Cross-currency) interest rate swaps are used as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the
income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the
hedged risks.
Effectiveness is tested retrospectively on a monthly basis by comparing the cumulative clean fair value
movement (since inception) of the hedged item, due to changes in both benchmark interest rates
and foreign exchange rates, to the total clean fair value movement of the hedging instrument (the
cumulative dollar offset method).
134 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item. In this case, the micro hedge relationship is de-
designated and it is re-designated at the beginning of the next period if expected to be highly
effective prospectively.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging is applied to hedge the variability arising on expected future cash flows due to
interest rate risk on available for sale corporate loans and/or corporate loans at amortised cost with
floating interest rates. As interest rates fluctuate, the future cash flows on these instruments also
fluctuate. NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of such cash flow fluctuations.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income within the cash flow
hedging reserve. Any gain or loss in fair value relating to an ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement in net trading income.
Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the
periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When a hedging instrument
expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative
gain or loss in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income
until the forecast cash flow is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive
income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedge effectiveness testing
To qualify for hedge accounting, NIBC requires that at the inception of the hedge and throughout its
life, each hedge must be expected to be highly effective (prospective effectiveness). Actual
effectiveness (retrospective effectiveness) must also be demonstrated on an ongoing basis.
The documentation of each hedging relationship describes how effectiveness will be assessed. For
prospective effectiveness, the hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for
which the hedge is designated. For actual effectiveness, the changes in fair value or cash flows must
offset each other in the bandwidth of 80% - 125% for the hedge to be deemed effective.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in net trading income.
Derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated as at fair value
through profit or loss
All gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of any derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement. Derivatives used to manage
the interest rate and credit spread exposure on certain financial assets and liabilities (mainly
structured funding, debt investments and residential mortgage loans) are not designated in hedging
relationships. Gains and losses on these derivatives together with the fair value movements on these
financial assets and liabilities are reported within net trading income.
Sale and repurchase agreements
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (Repos) are reclassified in the financial statements as
pledged assets when the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or re-pledge the
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 135
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
collateral; the counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks or other deposits as
appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (Reverse repos) are recorded as loans and advances
to other banks or customers, as appropriate. The difference between sale and repurchase price is
treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Impairment
General
The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset
or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and
impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or
more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a loss event) and that loss event
(or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
The criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss
include:
■ Delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest;
■ Cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower (for example: equity ratio and net income
percentage of sales);
■ Breach of loan covenants or conditions;
■ Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings;
■ Deterioration of the borrower’s competitive position;
■ Deterioration in the value of collateral.
The estimated period between a loss event occurring and its identification is determined by
management for each identified portfolio (Corporate loans, Mortgage loans at Own Book, EU
Corporate Credits and EU Structured Credits). The average period is six months for the different
Corporate loan portfolios and Mortgage loans at own book.
Losses expected from future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.
Financial assets reported at amortised cost
The group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial
assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not
individually significant. If the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an
individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of
financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues
to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been
incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the
asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in
the income statement. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any
136 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical
expedient, the group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an
observable market price.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial
asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the
collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of
similar credit risk characteristics (i.e. on the basis of the group’s risk rating process that considers asset
type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors). Those
characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being
indicative of the debtors’ ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
assets being evaluated.
Future cash flows from a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are
estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets in the group and historical loss
experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. Historical loss
experience is adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current
conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical loss experience is based and to
remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not currently exist.
Estimates of changes in future cash flows for groups of assets should reflect and be directionally
consistent with changes in related observable data from period to period (for example, changes in
unemployment rates, property prices, payment status, or other factors indicative of changes in the
probability of losses in the group and their magnitude). The methodology and assumptions used for
estimating future cash flows are reviewed regularly by the group to reduce any differences between
loss estimates and actual loss experience.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original effective rate of interest that
was used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
When a loan is uncollectible, it is written off against the related provision for loan impairment. Such
loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the
loss has been determined.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an
improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by
adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement
under impairments of financial assets.
Financial assets classified as available for sale
The group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset
or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale, a ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ decline in
the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are
impaired. ‘Significant’ and ‘prolonged’ are interpreted on a case-by-case basis for specific equity
securities. Generally fair value less than 75% of cost and 6-9 months are used as triggers.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 137
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If objective evidence of impairment exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss –
measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement – is removed
from other comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement under investment
income (sub line item gains less losses).
Reversals of impairment losses are subject to contrasting treatments depending on the nature of the
instrument concerned:
■ Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed
through the income statement;
■ If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale
increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment
loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income
statement.
Non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in
use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (Cash-Generating Units - CGUs). Non-financial assets, other than
goodwill that suffered an impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date. Impairment losses and the reversal of such losses, for non-financial assets other than
goodwill, are recognised directly in the income statement.
Renegotiated loans
Where possible, NIBC seeks to restructure loans rather than to take possession of collateral. This
may involve extending payment terms and the agreement of new loan conditions. Once the terms
have been renegotiated, any impairment is measured using the original effective interest rate as
calculated before the modification of terms and the loan is no longer considered past due.
Management continuously reviews renegotiated loans to ensure that all criteria are met and that
future payments are likely to occur. The loans continue to be subject to an individual or collective
impairment assessment, calculated using the loan’s original effective interest rate.
The method to determine impairments for renegotiated and or restructured loans is identical to that
for non-structured loans. 
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of
the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is
included in investments in associates. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently
when there are indications that impairment may have occurred and carried at cost less accumulated
138 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the
goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment.
Trademarks and licences
Separately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and licences
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks
and licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and
licences over their estimated useful lives of ten years.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three
years.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
expected life of the customer relationship.
Impairment of intangible assets
At each reporting date, NIBC assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable (see impairment – non-financial assets).
Tangible assets
Property (land and buildings), plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise offices and are measured at fair value (revaluation model). This fair value
is based on the most recent appraisals by independent registered appraisers, less straight-line
depreciation for buildings over the estimated economic life taking into account any residual value.
Buildings in own use are valued at market value on an unlet or let basis. If arm’s length lease
agreements have been concluded between NIBC group companies, the building is recognised at its
value as a let property. If there is no lease agreement, the property is recognised as vacant property.
Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the carrying amount of
the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising from revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other
reserves in shareholder’s equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 139
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
charged against other reserves directly in other comprehensive income; all other decreases are
charged to the income statement. Each year, the difference between depreciation based on the re-
valued carrying amount of the asset charged to the income statement and depreciation based on the
asset’s original cost is transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to
allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as
follows:
Buildings 30 - 50 years
Machinery 4 - 10 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 - 10 years
Assets under operating leases 1 - 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting
date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised within other operating income. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts
included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement at inception date.
A group company is the lessee
Operational lease
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another
party, the lessor, are classified as operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to income statement on
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Properties leased out under operating leases are
included in investment properties.
Financial lease
Leases of assets where the group has substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair
value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease
payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included
in other liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period. The investment properties acquired under finance leases are measured
subsequently at their fair value.
The leases entered into by the group are primarily operational leases. The total payments made
under operating leases are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. When an operational lease is terminated before the
140 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is
recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place.
A group company is the lessor
When assets are held subject to a financial lease, the present value of the lease payments is
recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the
receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of
the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of
return. When assets are held subject to an operating lease, the assets are included in Assets held
under operating leases under Property, plant and equipment.
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, the group issues financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit,
guarantees and acceptances. Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements
(within ‘other liabilities’) at fair value, being the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition,
the group’s liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised
less cumulative amortisation recognised in the income statement, and the best estimate of
expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee. Any
increase in the liability relating to financial guarantees is recorded in the income statement in
impairments of financial assets. The premium received is recognised in the income statement in fee
and commission income on a straight line basis over the life of the guarantee.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with
less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and non-restricted
balances with central banks and net credit balances on current accounts with other banks.
Cash balances are measured at face value while bank balances are measured at cost.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is
considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,
financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under
insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset in the scope of
IFRS 5 (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent
increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the
date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of
derecognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or
amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 141
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for
sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal
group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as
held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,
is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a
subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are
presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, if material, the comparative income
statement and cash flow statement are represented as if the operation had been discontinued from
the start of the comparative period.
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when:
■ The group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;
■ It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation;
■ The amount has been reliably estimated.
The group does not recognise provisions for projected future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in
settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised
even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of
obligations may be remote.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected required expenditure to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is
recognised as interest expense. Provisions are presented under other liabilities.
Contingent liabilities, if applicable, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed,
unless they are remote.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.
Employee benefits
Pension benefits
NIBC operates a defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable to a defined
contribution plan is in proportion to the services rendered to NIBC by the employees and is
recorded as an expense under personnel expenses and share-based payments. Unpaid contributions
are recorded as a liability. NIBC does not operate a defined benefit plan.
Termination benefits
NIBC recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group can no
longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
142 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In
the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured
based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
Share-based compensation
NIBC operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
Equity-settled transactions
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the
entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (shares or options) of
the group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to
the fair value of the shares or options granted:
■ Including any market performance conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares or options
that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the
period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each
reporting period, NIBC revises its estimates of the number of shares or options that are expected to
vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. NIBC recognises the impact of the revision to
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is
conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the
market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied. Similarly, awards
of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions are treated as vesting if all vesting conditions that
are not market conditions are met, irrespective of whether the non-vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised in
personnel expenses is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment
arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation,
and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award
where non-vesting conditions within the control of either NIBC or the counterparty are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award.
Cash-settled transactions
For the cash-settled share-based compensation plan, the fair value of the employee services received
in exchange for the grant of share-based compensation is recognised as a liability. The liability is re-
measured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value
recognised in the income statement in personnel expenses. The social security contributions payable
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 143
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in connection with the grant of the share options are considered an integral part of the grant itself,
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
A liability is recognised for cash-settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to our shareholder after certain adjustments. NIBC recognises a
provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a
constructive obligation.
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
shareholder’s equity (other comprehensive income), in which case it is recognised in shareholder’s
equity (other comprehensive income).
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax
rates (and laws) enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when NIBC intends to
settle on a net basis and a legal right of offset exists.
Deferred income tax is provided for in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
NIBC’s principal temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and
liabilities including derivative contracts, the depreciation of property and tax losses carried forward
and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired
and their tax base.
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries
and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry-forward are recognised as an asset when it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax related to the fair value remeasurement of available for sale investments and cash flow
hedges, which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, is also credited or
charged directly to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income
statement when the deferred gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
144 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Equity
Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is not a contractual obligation to transfer cash or other
financial assets.
Capital securities
As there is no formal obligation to (re)pay the principal or to pay a dividend the capital securities are
recognized as equity and dividends paid on capital securities are recognized directly in equity.
Issue costs of shares and capital securities
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities are recognised as a liability in the period that the
obligation for payment has been established, being in the period in which they are approved by the
shareholder.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods
and services in the ordinary course of the group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group.
The group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable
that future economic benefits will flow to the group and when specific criteria have been met for
each of the group’s activities as described below. The amount of revenue is not considered to be
reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The group bases its
estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction
and the specifics of each arrangement.
Interest income and expense
Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the income statement for all interest-bearing
instruments, including those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or
loss.
For all interest-bearing financial instruments, interest income or interest expense is recognised using
the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate,
to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability (on an amortised cost basis). The
calculation includes all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment
options) but not future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received
between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction
costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets is impaired, interest income is subsequently
recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of
measuring the impairment loss. Any increase in estimated future cash flows of financial assets
reclassified to loans and receivables at amortised cost on 1 July 2008 will result in a prospective
adjustment to the effective interest rates.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 145
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fee and commission income and expense
Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accrual basis when the service has been
provided. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred (together
with related direct costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan.
Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue when the syndication has been completed and NIBC
has retained no part of the loan package for itself or has retained a part at the same effective interest
rate as the other participants. Commissions and fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the
negotiation of, a transaction for a third party – such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares
or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses – are recognised on completion of the
underlying transaction. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised
based on the applicable service contracts, usually on a time-proportionate basis.
Asset management fees related to investment funds are recognised pro rata over the period in which
the service is provided. The same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and
custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time.
Performance-linked fees or fee components are recognised when the performance criteria are
fulfilled.
Investment income
Investment income includes the following income items:
Gains less losses from financial assets
Realised gains or losses from debt investments and equity investments as available for sale previously
recognised in other comprehensive income, and gains or losses from associates and equity
investments at fair value through profit or loss and impairment losses on equity investments are
recognised in the income statement as gains less losses from financial assets.
Dividend income
Dividends are recognised in the income statement when NIBC’s right to receive payment is
established.
Share in result of associates (equity method)
Share in result of associates includes gains and losses related to investments in associates (equity
method).
Net trading income
Net trading income comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss as well as realised gains and losses on
financial assets and financial liabilities excluding those presented under investment income; gains less
losses from financial assets. Net trading income includes related foreign exchange gains and losses.
Government grants
NIBC recognises an unconditional government grant in profit or loss as other income when the grant
becomes receivable. Other government grants are initially recognised as deferred income at fair value
if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and NIBC will comply with the conditions
associated with the grant; they are then recognised in profit or loss as other income on a systematic
basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate NIBC for expenses incurred are
recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised.
146 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Rental income
The group manages a portfolio of German Residential and Commercial Property. Rental income from
operating leases from the German Residential and Commercial Property is recognised in income on
a straight line basis over the lease term net of discounts and other deductions.
Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculation, gives details of the source
of cash and cash equivalents that became available during the year and the application of these cash
and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from
operating activities, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities.
Movements in loans and receivables and inter-bank deposits are included in the cash flow from
operating activities. Investing activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect
of financial investments, as well as investments in and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property,
plant and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are
treated as financing activities. Movements due to currency translation differences as well as the effects
of the consolidation of acquisitions, where of material significance, are eliminated from the cash flow
figures.
Fiduciary activities
NIBC acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on
behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income
arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements as they are not assets of the group.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
NIBC makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.
Estimates and judgements are principally made in the following areas:
■ Fair value of certain financial instruments;
■ Impairment of corporate loans;
■ Impairment of debt investments classified at amortised cost;
■ Impairment of debt investments classified as available for sale;
■ Impairment of equity investments classified as available for sale;
■ Income taxes.
Fair value of certain financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on quoted market prices in an active
market or, where no active market exists, by using valuation techniques. In cases where valuation
techniques are used, the fair values are estimated from market observable data, if available, or by
using models. Where market-observable inputs are not available, they are estimated based on
appropriate assumptions.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically
reviewed by qualified personnel independent of those who prepared them. All models are reviewed
prior to use and models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative
market prices. To the extent possible, models use only observable data; however, in areas such as
applicable credit spreads (both own credit spread and counterparty credit spreads), volatilities and
correlations may require management to estimate inputs.
Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. For the
identification of assumptions used in the determination of fair value of financial instruments and for
estimated sensitivity information for level 3 financial instruments, except for own liabilities and
mortgage loans designated at fair value through profit or loss, see note 44.
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
At 31 December 2017, the fair value of these liabilities was estimated to be EUR 821 million
(31 December 2016: EUR 933 million). This portfolio is designated at fair value through profit or loss
and is reported on the face of the balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Own debt securities in issue;
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Debt securities in issue structured; and
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Subordinated liabilities.
The portion of fair value changes on these liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
during 2017 attributable to the movement in credit spreads as reported in notes 36, 37 and 41
reflects gross amounts, excluding pull-to-par and model refinement effects.
148 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The bank estimates its own credit risk from market observable data such as NIBC senior unsecured
issues, NIBC subordinated issues and secondary prices for its traded debt.
The valuation of all the above classes of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or
loss is sensitive to the estimated credit spread used to discount future expected cash flows. A 10
basis point change in the weighted average credit spread used to discount future expected cash flows
would increase or decrease the fair value of these own financial liabilities at 31 December 2017 by
EUR 3.3 million (31 December 2016: EUR 4.0 million).
Mortgage loans
NIBC determines the fair value of mortgage loans (both those it holds in part of its own warehouse
and those it has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. This model discounts
expected cash flows (after expected prepayments) to present value using inter-bank zero-coupon
rates, adjusted for a spread that principally takes into account the costs and the risks of the assets.
Subsequently NIBC calculates two discount spreads, one via the top-down approach (i.e. retail
spread), and one via the bottom-up approach (i.e. securitisation spread).
The top-down approach derives a discount spread by taking into account the mortgage rates of
newly originated loans in the consumer market. The offered mortgage rate is determined by
collecting mortgage rates from other professional lenders sorted by product, loan-to-value class and
the fixed-rate period. The discount spread is derived by comparing the offered mortgage rate to the
market interest rates taking into account various upfront costs embedded in the offered mortgage
rate. Where deemed necessary, surcharges are added to reflect the illiquidity of certain sub-
portfolios.
Via the bottom-up approach a price is derived by determining the various components that market
participants would take into account when pricing the asset. This includes funding-related costs,
servicing costs and a compensation for prepayment and credit risks. Funding-related costs are derived
by assuming that the acquiring party will fund the acquired portfolio by securitising the assets via a
residential mortgage backed security (RMBS). NIBC therefore collects quotes from publicly issued
RMBS’s solely including Dutch mortgage loans, over a certain period before the measurement date.
Various transaction costs related to issuing and maintaining an RMBS are added to the observed
primary rates. Where deemed necessary, surcharges are added to reflect the illiquidity of certain sub-
portfolios. Any additional arbitrage opportunities that may exist (i.e. the difference between the
bottom-up approach versus the top down approach) are assumed to be only applicable to the first
call date of the RMBS-transaction.
In the consumer market there is currently limited trading activity in mortgage portfolios. Therefore
NIBC currently considers the discount spread determined via the bottom-up approach as the best
approximation of the fair value of its residential mortgage portfolio. The use of RMBS spreads
provides the best estimate of the spread that would be inherent in a transaction at the reporting date
motivated by normal business considerations.
The determination of the applicable discount spread (including a spread for prepayment risk) and
prepayment rates requires NIBC to apply judgement. A ten basis point shift in either direction of the
discount spread across the mortgage portfolio would have had either a positive or a negative impact
as of 31 December 2017 of approximately EUR 15 million (31 December 2016: EUR 16 million) on
the fair value of the mortgages. A shift of a full 1% from base case (increase from 9% to10%) in the
assumption NIBC makes about expected prepayments would have had an impact as of 31 December
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 149
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2017 of approximately EUR 10 million (31 December 2016: EUR 13 million) on the fair value of the
mortgages.
Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation
adjustment)
Credit Valuation Adjustments & Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs and DVAs) are incorporated into
derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of respectively the counterparty and NIBC. In
essence, CVA represents an estimate of the discounted expected loss on an Over The Counter (OTC)
derivative during the lifetime of a contract. DVA represents the estimate of the discounted expected
loss from the counterparty’s perspective. Both CVA and DVAs are applied to all OTC derivative
contracts, except those that benefit from a strong collateral agreement where cash collateral is
regularly exchanged, mitigating credit risk.
Fair value of equity investments
The group estimates the fair value of its equity investments using valuation models, and it applies the
valuation principles set forth by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation
Guidelines to the extent that these are consistent with IAS 39.
On 31 December 2017, the fair value of this portfolio was estimated to be EUR 323 million
(31 December 2016: EUR 245 million). This portfolio is reported as equity investments (including
investments in associates) at fair value through profit or loss (31 December 2017: EUR 287 million;
31 December 2016: EUR 204 million) and as equity investments at available for sale (31 December
2017: EUR 36 million; 31 December 2016: EUR 41 million).
For the determination of the fair value of equity investments and for estimated sensitivity to key
assumptions in the valuation, see note 44.
Impairment of corporate loans
NIBC assesses whether there is an indication of impairment of corporate loans classified as loans and
receivables at amortised cost on an individual basis on at least a quarterly basis. NIBC considers a
range of factors that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows that it expects to receive from
the loan, including the business prospects of the borrower and its industry sector, the realisable value
of collateral held, the level of subordination relative to other lenders and creditors, and the likely cost
and likely duration of any recovery process. Subjective judgements are made in the process including,
the determination of expected future cash flows and their timing and the market value of collateral.
Furthermore, NIBC’s judgements change with time as new information becomes available, or as
recovery strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to individual impairments, on a case-by-case
basis. NIBC regularly reviews the methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount
and timing of future cash flows, to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss
experience.
If, as at 31 December 2017, for each of NIBC’s impaired corporate loans, the net present value of the
estimated cash flows had been 5% lower or higher than estimated, NIBC would have recognised an
additional impairment loss or gain of EUR 7.3 million (31 December 2016: EUR 18.4 million).
Impairment of debt investments classified at amortised cost
NIBC assesses whether there is an indication of impairment on debt investments classified at
amortised cost on an individual basis on at least a quarterly basis. NIBC considers a range of factors
that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows that it expects to receive from the debt

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
investment including rating downgrades and delinquencies and/or defaults in the underlying asset
pools. Adjustments are also made to reflect such elements as deteriorating liquidity and increased
refinancing risk.
If, as at 31 December 2017, for each of NIBC’s impaired debt investments, the net present value of
the estimated cash flows had been 5% lower or higher than estimated, NIBC would have recognised
an additional impairment loss or gain of EUR 0.1million (31 December 2016: EUR 0.8 million).
Impairment of debt investments classified as available of sale
NIBC assesses whether there is an indication of impairment on debt investments classified as available
for sale on an individual basis on at least a quarterly basis. This requires similar judgement as applied
to debt investments at amortised cost.
The level of the impairment loss that NIBC recognises in the consolidated income statement is
equivalent to the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in the revaluation reserve of other
comprehensive income plus any additional impairment loss (if applicable). If, as at 31 December 2017,
for each of NIBC’s impaired debt investments, the fair value had been 5% lower or higher, NIBC
would have recognised an additional impairment loss or gain of EUR 0.1 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 0.1 million).
Impairment of equity investments classified as available for sale
NIBC determines an impairment loss on the available for sale equity investments held in the
Investment portfolio of the venture capital organisation when there has been a ‘significant’ or
‘prolonged’ decline in fair value below original cost. NIBC exercises judgement in determining what is
‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ by evaluating, among other factors, whether the decline is outside the
normal range of volatility in the asset’s price. In addition, impairment may be appropriate when there
is evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the company whose securities are held by NIBC,
a decline in industry or sector performance, adverse changes in technology or problems with
operational or financing cash flows.
The level of the impairment loss that NIBC recognises in the consolidated income statement is the
cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in the revaluation reserve of other comprehensive
income. If NIBC had deemed all of the declines in fair value of equity investments below cost as
‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’, the effect would have been a EUR 0.6 million (2016: EUR 0.4 million)
reduction in the profit before tax (investment income) in 2017.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets are included only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near
future against which these temporary differences can be offset. When determining future taxable
profits, estimates are used since these are subject to uncertainty.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Segment report
Segment information is presented in these consolidated financial statements on the same basis as
used for internal management reporting within NIBC Bank. Segment reporting puts forth a
presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods and a reconciliation
between the results of the operating segments and the consolidated financial statements. The
Managing Board is the Group's chief operating decision-maker.
Operating segments
Taking into account the changes, the operating segments are as follows:
Corporate client offering
Corporate client offering provides advice and debt, mezzanine and equity financing solutions to mid-
sized companies and entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Sectors in which we
are active include Commercial Real Estate, Food, Agriculture, Retail & Health, Infrastructure &
Renewables, Industries & Manufacturing, Telecom, Media, Technology & Services. Furthermore, we
are active in two global sectors in which we have longstanding expertise: Offshore Energy and
Shipping & Intermodal. This segment also includes NIBC Markets.
Retail client offering
Retail client offering offers savings products and mortgages to consumers who are seeking to actively
manage their financial objectives. Savings products are offered in the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium, and mortgages are offered in the Netherlands. We also offer brokerage services in Germany
under our label 'NIBC Direct.'
Treasury and Group Functions
Treasury and Group functions includes the bank's treasury function, asset and liability management,
risk management and the bank's Corporate Centre which includes HR & Corporate
Communications, Internal Audit, Legal & Compliance, Sustainability, Operations & Facilities,
Technology, and Finance, Tax & Strategy. A substantial part of the operating expenses as well as the
full time equivalents of Group Functions are allocated to corporate and retail client offering.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above-mentioned segments. Transfer
prices between operating segments are at an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions
with third parties.
Certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to Corporate client offering and Retail client
offering as they are managed on a group basis. These financial assets and liabilities are held within the
segment Treasury and Group Functions and mainly comprise cash, debt investments, derivative assets
and liabilities as well as majority of the bank's funding. As the assets of Corporate Banking and Retail
Banking are largely funded internally with transfer pricing, majority of NIBC's external funding is held
within Treasury and Group Functions.
Inter-segment income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation level.
Reconciliation with consolidated income statement
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in our Accounting Policies
section, with the exception of the following adjustment.

department.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 159
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Internal reorganisation 2016
A new operating model for the IT-department was developed in 2016. After a positive advice of the
Work Council it was decided to outsource some of the IT-tasks to an external supplier.
Internal reorganisation 2017
Following the evaluation of the staff base of Markets mid 2016, which resulted initially in a reduced
workforce of 5 FTE in 2016, in 2017 it was decided to end some of the Markets business activities.
As a consequence of approximately 15 FTE became redundant in 2017 and 20 FTE will become
redundant in 2018.
As a result of these internal reorganisations a one-off expense of approximately EUR 4.7 million is
recognised in 2017 (2016: EUR 5.4 million).
The number of FTEs decreased from 704 at 31 December 2016 to 666 at 31 December 2017. The
number of FTEs employed outside of the Netherlands decreased from 125 at 31 December 2016 to
115 at 31 December 2017.
The variable compensation in cash charged to the income statement increased in 2017 on the back
of improved performance and in view of the ongoing review of strategic options. The total amount of
variable income granted in 2017, with respect to the performance over 2016, amounts to
EUR 7.6 million. This grant consists of (direct and deferred) cash and (vested and unvested) share
based instruments. In 2017 one employee was awarded a total compensation of more than
EUR 1 million (2016: one employee).
Information on the pension charges is included in note 39 Employee benefits.

Components of variable compensation - NIBC Choice
NIBC Choice is NIBC Holding's share-based and deferred compensation plan and governs all variable
compensation components in the form of equity, equity-related and deferred cash compensation. In
addition to this, variable compensation can consist of a discretionary short- term cash bonus. NIBC
Choice is only open to management and employees and includes conditions relating to termination of
employment or certain corporate events, such as restructurings, affecting the rights that would
otherwise accrue to them.
The following table gives an overview of the different NIBC Choice instruments and their main
characteristics:

Common Depositary Receipt (CDR) Yes Equity-settled None
Conditional Common Depositary Receipt (CCDR) Yes Equity-settled None
Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipt (CRDR) Yes Equity-settled 4 years pro rata vesting
Phantom Share Unit (PSU) Yes Cash-settled None
Restricted Phantom Share Unit (RPSU) Yes Cash-settled 3 years pro rata vesting
Deferred cash No Cash-settled 3 years pro rata vesting
Depositary receipts
The Depositary Receipts (DRs), consisting of CDRs, CCDRs and CRDRs, are issued by Stichting
Administratiekantoor NIBC Holding (the Foundation) in accordance with its relevant conditions of
administration (administratievoorwaarden).
The Foundation issues a DR for each ordinary share it holds in NIBC Holding. The Foundation
exercises the voting rights in respect of each of these ordinary shares at its own discretion, while the
holder of a DR is entitled to the dividends and other distributions declared payable in respect of the
underlying ordinary share. Holders of DRs cannot exercise voting rights or request a power of
attorney from the Foundation to vote in respect of our ordinary shares.
Under the conditions of administration, the holders of DRs have pre-emption rights similar to other
shareholders of NIBC Holding, subject to the Foundation having been given pre- emptive rights.
Consequently, when given these pre-emptive rights, the Foundation will exercise the pre-emption
rights attached to the ordinary shares underlying the DRs if these holders so elect.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 161
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In 2009 a co-investment programme was introduced for Statutory Board members. Under this
programme Statutory Board members were granted matching shares (CRDRs), subject to a four-year
vesting period, on a net after-tax basis representing a 1:1 match to their personal investment in CDRs
at that time. These matching shares will become fully unconditional and vest immediately upon
change of control of NIBC Holding. NIBC has the discretion to offer new members of the Statutory
Board the opportunity to participate in this co-investment programme under the same conditions,
except for the ability to earn performance shares as this feature is presumed no longer to be in line
with the DNB Principles.
In 2009, a Long-Term Incentive plan (LTI) was introduced for the Statutory Board members and
selected senior management. The LTI is forward-looking and will be granted annually. Its main
objective is to provide an incentive to achieve a balanced mix of pre-agreed long-term financial and
non-financial performance conditions. The LTI is subject to three-year cliff vesting and an additional
retention period of two years and will be delivered in the form of CRDRs but, at the discretion of the
Supervisory Board, may be delivered in another form. On every vesting date, the applicable tranche
of CRDRs converts automatically into CCDRs if the vesting conditions are met.
Since 2012 the Supervisory Board was not permitted to grant LTI to Statutory Board members as
long as NIBC had not yet repaid all outstanding state guaranteed funding. As of 1 January 2015 the
long-term incentive arrangement (40% to 70% of base salary) was revoked by the Supervisory Board
and replaced by a short-term variable income component at target of 15% of base salary (with a
maximum of 20%).The variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined mix: 30% in cash, 20% in
deferred cash, 30% in Phantom Share Units and 20% in Restricted Phantom Share Units.
In December 2017 it was proposed by the Statutory Board and subsequently approved by the
Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board to change the Plan Rules Variable
Compensation (NIBC Choice) in order to allow delivery of Depositary Receipts (DR) for outstanding
Conditional Common Depositary Receipts (CCDR) in lieu of the occurrence of a change of control of
NIBC Holding. The one-off costs related to the change of Plan Rules in December 2017 amounts to
EUR 0.4 million. Furthermore it was decided that all unvested Conditional Restricted Depositary
Receipts (CRDR) outstanding at 1 January 2018 will vest immediately (accelerated vesting) into
CCDR. This applies to 3.558 CRDRs (net after tax basis) related to the cancellation of the Long Term
Incentive arrangement for certain Statutory Board members. Following this change of the Plan Rules
317,200 (net after tax basis) outstanding CCDRs were released into Common DRs in January 2018.

In 2010, a new equity-linked reward instrument was introduced as part of the Short-Term Incentive
(STI) plan for the Statutory Board members and selected senior management. The short-term
compensation in share-related awards consists of Phantom Share Units (PSUs) and/or Restricted
Phantom Share Units (RPSUs). RPSU awards are subject to a three-year vesting with one third vesting
each year on 1 April. All PSUs and RPSUs are subject to a one-year retention period as measured
from the date of vesting. For the Statutory Board the retention period of the equity-linked
instruments is five years. The RPSU and PSU has similar characteristics as the CRDR, such as eligibility
for dividend and a value which is tied to movements in the net asset value of NIBC Holding, however
RPSUs are not eligible for dividend. This short-term compensation can be converted into cash
immediately after the retention period and therefore is recognised as cash-settled.

Result recognition
With respect to all instruments relating to NIBC Choice (CDRs, CCDRs, CRDRs, PSUs, RPSUs and
deferred cash), an amount of EUR 3 million was expensed through personnel expenses in 2017
(2016: EUR 2 million), of which EUR 3 million (2016: EUR 2 million) refers to cash-settled
instruments (deferred cash and PSUs) and nil (2016: nil) to equity-settled instruments.
With respect to the cash-settled instruments (PSUs, RPSUs and deferred cash), the amount
expensed during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of
instruments originally granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at balance sheet date,
the vesting period and estimates of the number of instruments that will forfeit during the remaining
vesting period. The liability in the balance sheet with respect to cash-settled instruments is
EUR 5 million (2016: EUR 3 million).
With respect to the equity-settled instruments (CDRs, CCDRs and CRDRs), the amount expensed
during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of instruments
granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at grant date, the vesting period and
estimates of the number of instruments that will forfeit during the remaining vesting period.The
liability in the balance sheet relating to the cumulative expenses with respect to equity-settled
instruments is EUR 4 million (2016: EUR 4 million).
The current account with NIBC Holding includes EUR 29 million payable (2016: EUR 29 million)
relating to NIBC Choice. This is a result of recharges from NIBC Holding to its subsidiaries with
respect to NIBC Choice (equity-settled instruments). The recharge is accounted for upon vesting of
the granted equity settled NIBC Choice instruments. This amount payable is more than offset by a
receivable in the current account position with NIBC Holding for the capital contribution of
EUR 51 million (2016: EUR 51 million) in relation to the share-based payments programme granted
by NIBC Holding. The difference between both amounts relates to share-based expenses for which
the after payroll tax amounts were paid to the Foundation with subsequent delivery of Restricted
Depository Receipts, which have since then been converted into CDRs, by the Foundation to the
employees.

The changes in fair value in the previous table reflect movements due to both interest rate changes
and credit spread changes. As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets, the movement
due to interest rate changes and exchange rate differences is compensated by results on financial
derivatives.

The movement 'Other (including exchange rate differences)' completely exists of exchange rate
differences (EUR 25 million).

profit or loss) attributable to changes in interest rates and credit risk amounts to a loss of
EUR 8 million (2016: EUR 9 million) and the change for the current year is a gain of EUR 1 million.
The portion of fair value changes in 2017 included in the balance sheet amount (designated at fair

At 31 December 2017 the carrying amounts for mortgage loans own book (designated at fair value
through profit or loss) and securitised mortgages loans include a total revaluation adjustment of
EUR 331 million debit (2016: EUR 423 million debit) related to both interest rates and credit spreads.
As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets, the movement due to interest rate changes is
compensated by results on financial derivatives.
The portion of fair value changes in 2017 included in the balance sheet carrying amount related to
the movement in credit spreads on mortgages loans own book (see note 22) and securitised
mortgage loans amounted to EUR 19 million debit at 31 December 2017 (2016: EUR 35 million
debit), being an increase in the carrying amount.
The cumulative change in fair value included in the balance amount (designated at fair value through
profit or loss) attributable to changes in interest rates and credit risk amounts to a gain of
EUR 107 million (2016: EUR 98 million) and the change for the current year is a gain of
EUR 9 million.
Interest income from securitised mortgage loans is recognised in interest and similar income at the
effective interest rate. Fair value movements (excluding interest) are recognised in net trading

EUR 11 million (2016: EUR 14 million).
Securitised mortgage loans are recognised on NIBC's balance sheet based on the risks and rewards
NIBC retains in the special purpose entities (SPEs) issuing the mortgage-backed notes. Risks and
rewards can be retained by NIBC by retaining issued notes, providing overcollateralisation to the SPEs
or implementing reserve accounts in the SPEs. At the balance sheet date, NIBC retained
EUR 43 million (31 December 2016: EUR 135 million) of notes issued by the SPEs and reserve
accounts amounted to EUR 3 million (31 December 2016: EUR 11 million).

according to IAS 39.
180 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The derivatives in this category consist of:
■ Interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of the mortgage portfolio;
■ Interest rate swaps to transform fixed rate funding into floating rate funding;
■ FX and cross-currency swaps to fund the non-euro loans to customers or to transform non-euro
funding into euros;
■ Client-driven derivative transactions and hedges resulting from this activity;
■ Limited money market trading.
Economically all these derivatives, with the exception of the limited money market trading, are used
to hedge interest rate or FX risk. The limited money market trading is controlled by a small facilitating
VaR limit of EUR 2.25 million. For further details see note 58 Market Risk (Key risk statistics Trading
portfolio, excluding NIBC Markets).
In 2017 NIBC started offsetting assets and liabilities related to derivative transactions with central
clearing members. Under certain conditions derivative positions with the same characteristics such as
counterparty, maturity bucket and currency are netted, for a total amount of EUR 332 million (for
further details reference is made to note 46).
Derivative balances have decreased significantly in 2017. Part of the decrease is driven by market
developments. As the positions mainly relate to hedges of interest rate risks, the interest rate
movements of 2017 have affected the balances. In addition to these regular developments, two
separate actions have led to an additional reduction of the derivative balances. During 2017, NIBC
has reviewed its hedging positions and has closed out many offsetting positions and replaced off-
market derivatives with new derivatives at current market rates. As settlement processes and systems
have been adjusted following the implementation of central clearing, more positions are eligible for
off-setting. This has led to an additional reduction of the reported derivative balances.

Hedging activities
Portfolio fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by the Asset & Liability Committee
(ALCO). Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk
arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a
portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging
transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2017 was EUR 16 million debit (2016: EUR 18 million debit). The
losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 2 million (2016: nil). The gains on the hedged items
attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 3 million (2016: nil). Differences between the results
recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Portfolio fair value hedge of fixed rate retail deposits
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate retail deposit activities above certain limits prescribed by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses
interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To
mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the retail
deposits with a contractual duration longer than two years and the corresponding hedging
transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2017 was EUR 16 million debit (2016: EUR 33 million debit). The
losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 8 million (2016: loss of EUR 6 million). The gains on the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 9 million (2016: gain of EUR 7 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Portfolio fair value hedge of fixed rate mortgages
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate mortgages activities above certain limits prescribed by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses
interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate mortgages. To
mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the mortgages
with a contractual duration longer than three months and the corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2017 was EUR 29 million credit (2016: EUR 59 million credit). The
gains on the hedging instruments were EUR 35 million (2016: loss of EUR 32 million). The losses on
the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 36 million (2016: gain of EUR 40 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness and pipeline hedging.
Micro fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate and foreign
exchange risk from its fixed rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest
rate risk and foreign exchange risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting
mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge for fixed rate plain vanilla funding and
corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2017 was EUR 30 million debit (2016: EUR 59 million debit). The
losses on the hedging instruments were EUR 34 million (2016: gain of EUR 8 million). The gains on
the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 31 million (2016: loss of EUR 7 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Portfolio fair value hedge of loans
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its
corporate loan activities above certain limits as set by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate
swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising from these fixed rate loans. To mitigate any
accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate loan and
corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these

Micro fair value hedge of the Liquidity portfolio debt investments
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to fair value interest rate risk from
its fixed rate debt investments held in the Liquidity portfolios above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising
on this fixed rate debt investments. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a
micro fair value hedge for fixed rate debt investments and corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2017 was nil. (2016: nil). The gains on the hedging instruments were nil
(2016: nil). The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were nil (2016: nil).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Cash flow hedges
NIBC has classified a large part of its corporate loans as loans and receivable at amortised cost.
Therefore, variability in the cash flows of the floating rate corporate loans is accounted for in future
periods, when the coupons are recorded in the income statement on an amortised cost basis.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the floating cash flows of its floating corporate loans. These
swaps are reported at fair value through profit or loss. This accounting mismatch creates volatility in
the income statement of NIBC. Therefore NIBC applies hedge accounting on these positions. Hedge
accounting is applied to all swaps that are used to hedge the cash flow risk of the floating corporate
loans by defining a macro cash flow hedge relationship with the floating corporate loans.
The variability in interest cash flows arising on floating rate corporate loans is hedged on a portfolio
basis with interest rate swaps that receive fixed and pay floating (generally one, three and six months
floating rates). The highly probable cash flows being hedged relate both to the highly probable cash
flows on outstanding corporate loans and to the future reinvestment of these cash flows. NIBC does
not hedge the variability of future cash flows of corporate loans arising from changes in credit
spreads.
Interest rate swaps with a net fair value of EUR 17 million credit (2016: EUR 48 million debit) were
designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. The cash flow on the hedged item will be reported in
income over the next seven years. In 2017 the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
that arose from cash flow hedges was a loss of EUR 5 million (2016: loss of EUR 2 million).
Some macro cash flow hedging relationships ceased to exist during 2011 and therefore the related
cumulative hedge adjustment as from that date is being amortised over the remaining contractual
maturity of the hedged item.
The amount that was recognised in equity for the year 2017 was EUR 10 million debit (2016:
EUR 12 million credit). The amount that was transferred from equity to the income statement in
2017 was a gain of EUR 7 million net of tax (2016: gain of EUR 18 million).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured for all temporary differences using the liability
method. The effective tax rate in the Netherlands for measuring deferred tax is 25% (2016: 25%).
There were no changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in the effective tax
rate in the Netherlands. No deferred tax asset has been recognised for unused tax losses in the
Netherlands totaling EUR 69 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 106 million).
Deferred tax assets of EUR 17 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 27 million)
have not been recognised because future taxable profits are not considered probable. The term to
maturity of the majority of these carry forward losses is three years at the maximum.
Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carry forward losses can only be utilized if taxable profits
are realised in the future. To measure deferred tax assets, NIBC Holding takes a management best
estimate regarding future compensation of carry forward losses. On 31 December 2017 there was a
realistic expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be generated within the applicable periods
for the recognised deferred tax asset based on internal (medium term) forecasts, which include
estimates for the development of own credit spread, tax exempt results on equity investments and
allocation of the expected impact of the introduction of IFRS9 as from 1 January 2018.
Corporate income tax is allocated by NIBC Holding N.V. to the company to which it relates and

Administrative expenses 1 1
One-off employers pension contribution 1 -

Employer's contributions in 2017 includes EUR 2 million (2016: EUR 2 million) intended to
compensate for the pension gap that arose as a result of changed tax rules that became effective as
of 1 January 2015.
In 2017, in negotiation with the Works Council, new appointments were made for the annual
pension contribution for the period 2018 - 2020. As part of the negotiations the Employer agreed to
pay a one-off pension contribution of EUR 1 million to the premium reserve of the Pension Fund
before the end of December 2017.
Obligations and expense under pension plans
A defined-contribution plan is a pension plan under which NIBC each year pays a fixed percentage of
the salaries of the members into the scheme. The size of the fund on retirement will be determined
by how much was contributed to the scheme and the investment return achieved.
For defined-contribution plans, NIBC pays contributions directly into the member's scheme. NIBC
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The CDC-plan is based on an average salary plan. The retirement age is set at 68 years, as per
1 January 2018. The contribution payable by participants in the CDC-plan is maximised at 4% per
annum. Under the CDC-plan the annual pension contributions are calculated according to a fixed
contribution calculation mechanism. The annual pension contribution of NIBC is maximised at 26% of
the pensionable salary (salary minus a social security deductible). By paying the agreed fixed annual
contribution NIBC is released from all its obligations.

This note describes the fair value measurement of both financial and non-financial instruments and is structured
as follows:
44.1 Valuation principles
44.2 Valuation governance
44.3 Financial instruments by fair value hierarchy
44.4 Valuation techniques
44.5 Valuation adjustments and other inputs and considerations
44.6 Impact of valuation adjustments

44.8 Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2
44.9 Movements in level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value
44.10 Impact on fair value of level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value of changes to key assumptions
44.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data
44.12 Fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value
44.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
44.1 Valuation principles
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current
market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using a valuation technique.
In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a
hierarchy of valuation techniques, as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
and
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
44.2 Valuation governance
NIBC’s fair value methodology and the governance over its models includes a number of controls and
other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All
new product initiatives (including their valuation methodologies) are subject to approvals by various
functions of NIBC including the Risk and Finance functions. Once submitted, fair value estimates are
also reviewed and challenged by the Risk and Finance functions.
44.3 Financial instruments by fair value hierarchy
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to
initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the
degree to which the fair value is observable:

44.4 Valuation techniques
The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments that are
recorded at fair value using either quoted prices or valuation techniques. These incorporate NIBC's
interpretation of valuation assumptions (qualitative) that a market participant would consider when
valuing the instruments.
Financial assets available-for-sale
Debt investments - level 1
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2016, NIBC used market-observable prices
(including broker quotes). NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time,
ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations.
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2016, NIBC applied market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Loans - level 3
For the level 3 loans classified at available-for-sale, NIBC determines the fair value based on the
unobservable sales pricings from external parties and on an internal development valuation model.
Equity investments (unlisted) - level 3
The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by
the managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to
ascertain that the reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value
principles as part of a robust process. To approximate the fair value at the reporting date, the net
asset value is adjusted, where appropriate, for factors such as, subsequent capital contributions and
fund distributions, movements in exchange rate and subsequent changes in the fair value of the
underlying investee companies, where these are known to NIBC.
The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable
earnings. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ Earnings
Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). Capitalisation multiples are derived
from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months EBITDA at the acquisition date. On
each reporting date, the capitalisation multiple of each equity investment is compared against those
derived from the publicly available enterprise value and earnings information of traded peers, where
206 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
these can be identified. Peer capitalisation multiples are normalised for factors such as differences in
regional and economic environment, time lags in earnings information and one-off gains and losses.
The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and
management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity.
Debt investments - level 3
For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis
that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates
and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market
liquidity discounts.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Equity investments - level 1
The level 1 portfolio consists of unadjusted, quoted prices for assets in an active market. The assets
have been valued at the market’s closing price of the 30rd of December.
Loans - level 2
In an active market environment, these assets are marked-to-market by applying market bid quotes
observed on the secondary market. The quotes received from other banks or brokers and applied in
the marked-to-market process are calibrated to actual market trades whenever possible.
In certain instances, where the market is inactive, a discounted cash flow model is used based on
various assumptions including market interest rates, market credit spread levels and assumptions
regarding market liquidity, where relevant. Additional pricing reference points have been obtained by
collecting spreads using primary transactions that are comparable with the relevant loans.
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2016, NIBC applied market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Derivatives financial assets and liabilities (held for trading and used for hedging) - level 2
Derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs are mainly
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The most
frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The
models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange rates, credit spread levels and interest
rate curves. Credit derivative valuation models also require input as to the estimated probability of
default and recovery value.
Loans - level 3
For the level 3 loans classified at fair value through profit or loss, NIBC determines the fair value
based on the unobservable sales pricings from external parties and on an internal development
valuation model.
Mortgage loans (own book and securitised) - level 3
NIBC determines the fair value of mortgage loans (both those NIBC holds on its own book and
those NIBC has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. To calculate the fair
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 207
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
value, NIBC discounts expected cash flows (after expected prepayments) to present value using
inter-bank zero-coupon rates, adjusted for a spread that principally takes into account the credit
spread risk of the mortgages and uncertainty relating to prepayment estimates.
The RMBS spread is determined by collecting RMBS spreads from publicly issued Dutch RMBS-
transactions. The discount spread is derived by adding related RMBS costs to the RMBS spread.
Sensitivity analysis carried out on the prepayment rates used in the valuation model of the mortgage
loans showed that the variability in these rates does not have a significant impact on the total value of
the Residential Mortgage portfolio.
Equity investments (including investments in associates) - level 3
The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by
the managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to
ascertain that the reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value
principles as part of a robust process. To approximate the fair value at the reporting date, the net
asset value is adjusted, where appropriate, for factors such as, subsequent capital contributions and
fund distributions, movements in exchange rate and subsequent changes in the fair value of the
underlying investee companies, where these are known to NIBC.
The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable
earnings. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ Earnings
Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). Capitalisation multiples are derived
from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months EBITDA at the acquisition date. On
each reporting date, the capitalisation multiple of each equity investment is compared against those
derived from the publicly available enterprise value and earnings information of traded peers, where
these can be identified. Peer capitalisation multiples are normalised for factors such as differences in
regional and economic environment, time lags in earnings information and one-off gains and losses.
The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and
management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity.
Debt investments - level 3
For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis
that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates
and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market
liquidity discounts.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (including trading)
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - level 2
This portfolio was designated at fair value through profit or loss and is reported on the face of the
balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Own debt securities in issue (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
■ Debt securities in issue structured (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss); and
■ Subordinated liabilities (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss).
Debt securities in issue structured consist of notes issued with embedded derivatives that are tailored
to specific investors’ needs. The return on these notes is dependent upon the level of certain
underlying equity, interest rate, currency, credit, commodity or inflation-linked indices. The embedded
208 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
derivative within each note issued is fully hedged on a back-to-back basis, such that effectively
synthetic floating rate funding is created. Because of this economic hedge, the income statement is
not sensitive to fluctuations in the price of these indices.
In the case of debt securities in issue structured and subordinated liabilities, the fair value of the notes
issued and the back-to-back hedging swaps is determined using valuation models developed by a
third party employing Monte Carlo simulation, lattice valuations or closed formulas, depending on the
type of embedded derivative. These models use market-observable inputs (e.g. interest rates, equity
prices) for valuation of these structures.
For each class of own financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the expected cash flows
are discounted to present value using interbank zero-coupon rates. The resulting fair value is adjusted
for movements in the credit spread applicable to NIBC issued funding.
44.5 Valuation adjustments and other inputs and considerations
Credit and debit valuation adjustments
NIBC calculates CVA/DVA (as defined in Critical accounting estimates and judgements) on a
counterparty basis over the entire life of the exposure.
Bid-offer
NIBC's pricing models initially calculate mid-market prices, which are subsequently adjusted to reflect
bid-offer spreads (the difference between prices quoted for sales and purchases). NIBC Markets
pricing models use bid prices.
Day 1 profit
A Day 1 profit, representing the difference between the transaction price and the fair value output of
internal models, is recognised when the inputs to the valuation models are observable market data.

44.10  Impact on fair value of level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value of
changes to key assumptions
The following table provides a summary of the valuation techniques, key unobservable inputs and the
lower and upper range of such unobservable inputs, by type of level 3 asset/liability. The lower and
upper range mentioned in the overview represent the lowest and highest variance of the respective
valuation input as actually used in the valuation of the different financial instruments. Amounts and
percentages stated are unweighted. The range could change from period to period subject to market
movements and change in level 3 position. Lower and upper bounds reflect the variability of level 3
positions and their underlying valuation inputs in the portfolio, but do not adequately reflect their
level of valuation uncertainty. For valuation uncertainty assessment, please refer to following section

Non-Listed equity investments
Level 3 equity securities mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity
securities which are not traded in active markets. In the absence of an active market, fair values are
estimated on the analysis of fund manager reports, company's financial position and other factors.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 215
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Discount spreads
Discount spread is the spread above a market interest rate, based on Euribor, which is used to
discount the projected cash flows. The lower range is the outcome of a bottom-up valuation
approach, the upper range is the result of a top-down valuation approach.
Expected sales prices underlying assets
The fair value of the loans available for sale is highly dependend on the projected sales prices of the
underlying assets. The lower level assumes actual salesprices of 75% of the projected sales prices the
higher level assumes actual salesprices of 125%.
Price
For securities where market prices are not available fair value is measured by comparison with
observable pricing data from similar instruments. Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no
recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay good
yield.
Debt investments AFS
Level 3 AFS debt investments are valued based on the expected cashflows of the instrument flowing
from the collateral.
44.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data

In order to determine the reasonably possible alternative assumptions, NIBC adjusted key
unobservable valuation technique inputs as follows:
■ For equity investments, the material unobservable input parameters, such as capitalisation multiple,
that are applied to the maintainable earnings to determine fair value are adjusted by 5%;
216 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ For the mortgage loans classified at fair value through profit or loss (both those NIBC holds on its
own book and those NIBC has securitised), NIBC adjusted the discount spread with 10bp as a
reasonably possible alternative outcome;
■ For the debt investments, NIBC adjusted the weighted average calculated model price by 100
basis points as a reasonably possible alternative outcome. The primary unobservable input in the
calculated model price is the applicable credit spread; and
■ For loans, the material unobservable input parameters, such as discounts on sale prices, a 5%
deviation in fair value is a reasonably possible alternative assumption.
In 2016, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affect the
fair value of the NIBC's financial assets and liabilities and there were no reclassifications of financial
assets.

approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These
financial instruments include cash and balances with central banks, due from other banks, due to

other banks, deposits from customers and other financial liabilities. These financial instruments are
not included in the previous table.
44.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
NIBC's land and buildings are valued at fair value through equity. The carrying amount of NIBC's land
and buildings (level 3) as of 31 December 2017 was EUR 40 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 40 million). The land and buildings were last revalued as of 31 December 2017 based on
external appraisal. No fair value movements were recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income or the income statement in respect of NIBC's land and buildings in 2017 and 2016.
45 Reclassification financial assets (application of amendments to IAS 39
and IFRS 7)
As of 1 July 2008, NIBC reclassified non-derivative trading financial assets, which do not meet the
definition of loans and receivables and are no longer held for the purpose of selling them in the near
term, from held for trading to available-for-sale. NIBC believes that the deterioration of the world’s
financial markets that occurred in the course of 2008 represents a rare circumstance that allows such
a reclassification, under the exemption rules of IAS 39.
In addition, NIBC reclassified financial assets from held for trading and available-for-sale to loans and
receivables. At the date of reclassification NIBC had the intention and ability to hold these reclassified
loans and receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity.

Revaluation reserve financial assets reclassified into available-for-sale category
NIBC chose to reclassify (as of 1 July 2008) certain financial assets that were no longer held for the
purpose of selling in the near term as permitted by the amendment to lAS 39 and IFRS 7. In NIBC's
judgement, the deterioration in the world's financial markets was an example of a rare circumstance
applicable on the date of reclassification. Had NIBC determined that the market conditions during
2008 did not represent a rare circumstance or that NIBC did not have the intention and ability to
hold the financial assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity, and had NIBC therefore not
reclassified the financial assets, no net of tax gain (2016: no gain) would have been recognised in the
income statement and an incremental net of tax gain of EUR 7 million (2016: net of tax gain of
EUR 1 million) would have been recognised in the revaluation reserve in equity in 2017 due to
changes in fair value.

Related amounts which cannot be set off in the balance sheet position are amounts which are part of
ISDA netting agreements. The related amounts are reported on the asset side and the liability side of
the balance sheet as the ISDA agreements does not meet all requirements for offsetting in IAS 32.
In 2017 NIBC Holding started offsetting assets and liabilities related to derivative transactions with
central clearing members. Under certain conditions derivative positions with the same characteristics
such as counterparty, maturity bucket and currency are netted.
47 Repurchase and resale agreements and transferred financial assets
NIBC has a programme to borrow and lend securities and to sell securities under agreements to
repurchase (‘repos’) and to purchase securities under agreements to resell (‘reverse repos’). The
securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase are transferred to a third party and NIBC
receives cash, or other financial assets in exchange. The counterparty is allowed to sell or repledge
220 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
those securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements in the absence of default by NIBC, but has
an obligation to return the securities at the maturity of the contract. These transactions are
conducted under terms based on the applicable ISDA Collateral Guidelines. If the securities increase
or decrease in value, NIBC may in certain circumstances, require, or be required, to pay additional
cash collateral. NIBC has determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of these
securities and therefore has not derecognised them. In addition, it recognises a financial liability for
cash received as collateral.
Similarly NIBC may sell or repledge any securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to
resell, but has an obligation to return the securities and the counterparty retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership. Consequently the securities are not recognised by NIBC, which
instead records a separate asset for the cash collateral given.
NIBC conducts these transactions under terms agreed in Global Master Repurchase Agreements. As
per year-end 2017 NIBC did not have any repuchase and resale agreement related positions as
described in this Note (2016: nil).
Transferred financial assets
This disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and
associated financial liabilities in order to understand which risks the bank is exposed to when the
assets are transferred.
If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised on the balance sheet, NIBC is still exposed to
changes in the fair value of the assets.

RMBS programme
NIBC uses securitisations as a source of funding whereby the Structured Entity (SE) issues debt
securities. Pursuant to a securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, NIBC transfers the title
of the assets to SEs.When the cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by
consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (residential mortgage loans) are considered to be
transferred.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 221
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Covered Bond programme
Under NIBC's Covered Bond programme, notes are issued by NIBC from its own balance sheet.
Bond holders are protected from suffering a loss even in the event that NIBC defaults because at the
point the notes were issued, NIBC also transferred the legal title of a portfolio of mortgages to a
Structured Entity (SE) to act as collateral for the covered bond investors. From a legal perspective, the
SE guarantees the repayment of the Covered Bonds. The title transfer of the mortgages has been
achieved by NIBC providing an inter-company loan on the same terms and conditions as the external
bonds to the SE. The SE used the proceeds to purchase the mortgage portfolio. The net result is that
the SE retains the legal title, but proceeds from the mortgages are passed through the intercompany
loan to the covered bond holders. NIBC consolidates the SE on the basis that, in addition to having
power as the sole owner, NIBC also is entitled to substantial variable returns through the over-
collateralised portion of the sold mortgages.
Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets that are derecognised in their
entirety
NIBC does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where
NIBC has continuing involvement.
48 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-
interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.
The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table
by category. In the following table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced.
The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would
be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.

Contract amount:

Capital commitments with respect to equity investments 12 19
Guarantees granted 43 76
Irrevocable letters of credit 35 18
1,781 2,124
These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
222 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC’s policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 56 Credit risk.
Contingent liabilities related to income tax
The European Commission has addressed questions related to the Dutch Government about article
29a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code. If the European Commission would decide to start a
formal investigation and ultimately would conclude that this is a case of state aid, NIBC may have to
repay tax benefits it will enjoy from 208 onwards Article 29a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax
Code was included in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code so that capital instruments issued by
credit institutions and which are covered by EU regulation 575/2013 would be considered tax
deductible. In this context NIBC issued Capital Securities in September 2017, amounting
EUR 200 million at a fixed interest rate of 6%. The contingent liability related to this matter may start
at the (fully discretionary) first coupon payment date (scheduled in March 2018).
Claims, investigations, litigation or other proceedings or actions may have a
material adverse effect on NIBC’s business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.
NIBC is involved in a number of proceedings and settlement negotiations that arise with customers,
counterparties, current or former employees or others arising in the ordinary course of business.
Proceedings may relate to, for example, alleged violations of NIBC’s duty of care (zorgplicht) vis-a-vis
its (former) customers, the provision of allegedly inadequate investment advice or the provision of
allegedly inadequate services. Dutch financial services providers are increasingly exposed to collective
claims from groups of customers or consumer organisations seeking damages for an unspecified or
indeterminate amount or involving unprecedented legal claims in respect of assumed mis-selling or
other violations of law or customer rights. While NIBC has made considerable investment in
reviewing and assessing historic sales and “know your customer” practices and in the maintenance of
risk management, legal and compliance procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be
no assurance that all of the issues associated with current and historic sales practices have been or
will be identified, nor that any issues already identified will not be more widespread than presently
estimated. Furthermore, customer protection regulations as well as changes in interpretation and
perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable market practices
might influence client expectations. Negative publicity associated with certain sales practices,
compensation payable in respect of such issues or regulatory changes resulting from such issues could
have a material adverse effect on NIBC’s reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.
It is difficult for NIBC to predict the outcome of many of the pending or future claims, regulatory
proceedings and other adversarial proceedings. The costs and staffing capacity required to defend
against future actions may be significant. Counterparties in these proceedings may also seek publicity,
over which NIBC will have no control, and this publicity could lead to reputational harm to NIBC and
potentially decrease customer acceptance of NIBC’s services, regardless of whether the allegations
are valid or whether NIBC is ultimately found liable. In addition, NIBC’s provisions for defending these
claims may not be sufficient.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 223
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On the basis of legal advice, taking into consideration the facts known at present NIBC is of the
opinion that the outcome of these proceedings is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results.

Acquisitions in 2016
Acquisition of SNS Securities N.V.
On 30 June 2016, NIBC obtained control of SNS Securities N.V., located in Amsterdam, by acquiring
100% of the share capital and voting interests in the company from SNS Bank N.V. With the
acquisition, NIBC initially intended to expand its service offering with capital market solutions, bond
and stock broking, research and execution services for independent asset managers, commercial
lending and principal investments. The acquisition of SNS Securities N.V. has been approved by the
appropriate regulatory authorities and work councils. On 30 June 2016 SNS Securities N.V. changed
its name into NIBC Markets N.V. Based on change in strategic priorities NIBC announced in January
2017 to discontinue a part of these services in the first half year of 2017.
Acquisition-related costs
Acquisition related costs of EUR 1 million have been charged to other operating expenses in the
consolidated income statement for the period ended 31 December 2016.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred and the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The fair value of the identifiable net assets is based on an

Information on subsidiaries
Composition of NIBC
NIBC consists of 50 (2016: 59) consolidated entities, including 15 (2016: 13) consolidated structured
entities (for further details see note 54). 33 (2016: 46) of the entities controlled by NIBC are directly
or indirectly held by NIBC at 100% of the ownership interests (share of capital). Third parties also
hold ownership interests in 17 (2016: 13) of the consolidated entities (non-controlling interests).
Accounting for investment in subsidiaries
In the company financial statements of NIBC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at net asset value.
Principal subsidiaries
NIBC's principal subsidiaries are set out in the following table. This includes those subsidiaries that are
most significant in the context of NIBC’s business, results or financial position.

Significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the scope of the consolidation
Determining whether NIBC has control of an entity is generally straightforward, based on ownership
of the majority of the voting rights. However, in certain instances this determination will involve
significant judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not
the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement may involve assessing
the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether NIBC, or
another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right
or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over
structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other
investors’ exposures to the structure’s variable returns have been substantively eliminated, NIBC may
conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore NIBC will
consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% (or in certain circumstances large minority
shareholding) would typically indicate that NIBC has control of an entity. However certain entities are
excluded from consolidation because NIBC does not have exposure to their variable returns and/or
are managed by external parties and consequently are not controlled by NIBC. Where appropriate,
interests relating to these entities are included in note 54 Structured entities.
See the basis of consolidation section of the Accounting policies for further information on other
factors affecting consolidation of an entity.
Significant restrictions to access or use NIBC’s assets
Legal, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests
might restrict the ability of NIBC to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within
NIBC and to settle liabilities of NIBC.
Since NIBC did not have any material non-controlling interests at the balance sheet date, any
protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.
Restrictions impacting NIBC’s ability to use assets:
■ NIBC has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities
financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative
liabilities;
■ The assets of consolidated structured entities are held for the benefit of the parties that have
bought the notes issued by these entities; and

Previous table excludes assets that are not encumbered at an individual entity level but which may be
subject to restrictions in terms of their transferability within NIBC. Such restrictions may be based on
local connected lending requirements or similar regulatory restrictions. In this situation, it is not
feasible to identify individual balance sheet items that cannot be transferred. This is also the case for
regulatory minimum liquidity requirements. NIBC identifies the volume of liquidity reserves in excess
of local stress liquidity outflows. The aggregate amount of such liquidity reserves that are considered
restricted for this purpose is EUR 150 million and EUR 133 million as per 31 December 2017 and
31 December 2016, respectively.

Information on associates
NIBC holds interests in 32 (2016: 33) associates. Five associates are considered to be material to
NIBC, based on the carrying value of the investment and NIBC’s income from these investees. There

54 Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined
objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
The principal use of structured entities is to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets
and to provide market liquidity for clients through securitising financial assets. Structured entities may
be established as corporations, trusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the
purchase of assets by issuing notes that are collateralised by and/or indexed to the assets held by the
structured entities. The notes issued by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of
subordination.
Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between NIBC and the
structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by NIBC, as pointed out in the
Accounting policies section Basis of consolidation. In other cases it may sponsor or have exposure to
such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in consolidated structured entities
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC primarily has contractual arrangements for securitisation vehicles which may require it to
provide financial support. NIBC uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk
transfer. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, there were no significant outstanding loan commitments
to these entities.
Financial support provided or to be provided to consolidated structured entities
NIBC has not provided any non-contractual financial support during 2016 and 2015 and does not
anticipate providing non-contractual support to consolidated structured entities in the future.
Unconsolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The structured entities covered by this section are not consolidated since NIBC does not has control
them through voting rights, contract, funding agreements and/or other means. The extent of NIBC’s
interests in unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entity.
Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments,
liquidity facilities and guarantees in which NIBC is absorbing variability of returns from the structured
entities.
234 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC established securitisation vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed-
income securities, corporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial, residential
and mortgage-backed assets). The securitisation vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple
tranches of notes.
Third-party fund entities
NIBC provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the
form of funding entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralised by the
asset in the structured entities. NIBC’s involvement involves predominantly equity investments.
Income derived from involvement with unconsolidated structured entities
NIBC earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment
management services in relation to funds. Interest income is recognised on the funding provided to
structured entities. Movements in the value of different types of notes held by NIBC in structured
entities are recognised in net trading income.
Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities
The maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the
unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is
reflected in their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for
off-balance sheet instruments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS
12, as interpreted by NIBC, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts do not reflect the
economic risks faced by NIBC because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or
hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred.
At 31 December 2017 off-balance sheet instruments amounts to EUR 14 million (2016:
EUR 21 million). There were no derivatives linked to structured unconsolidated entities.
Size of structured entities
NIBC provides a different measure for the size of structured entities depending on their type. The
following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of
structured entities:
■ Securitisations – notional of notes in issue when NIBC derives its interests through notes its holds
and notional of derivatives when NIBC’s interests is in the form of derivatives; and
■ Third party fund entities – total assets in entities. For third party fund entities, size information is
based on the latest available investor reports and financial statements.
Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The following table shows, by type of unconsolidated structured entity, the carrying amounts of
NIBC’s interests recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the
maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. It also provides an indication of the size of
the structured entities. The carrying amounts presented below do not reflect the true variability of
returns faced by NIBC because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges.

Exposure to losses
NIBC’s exposure to losses related to securitisations depends on the level of subordination of the
interest which indicates the extent to which other parties are obliged to absorb credit losses before
NIBC. This is summarised in the following table. There is no significant level of subordination relating
to third-party funding.

From the 21,254 outstanding CRDRs at 31 December 2017, 17,696 will vest on 1 January 2018 and
3,558 will vest on 1 January 2019. In December 2017 it was proposed by the Statutory Board and
subsequently approved by the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board to
change the Plan Rules Variable Compensation (NIBC Choice) in order to allow delivery of Depositary
Receipts (DR) for outstanding Conditional Common Depositary Receipts (CCDR) in lieu of the
occurrence of a change of control of NIBC Holding. Furthermore it was decided that all unvested
Conditional Restricted Depositary Receipts (CRDR) outstanding at 1 January 2018 will vest immediately
(accelerated vesting) into CCDR. This applies to 3.558 CRDRs (net after tax basis) related to the
cancellation of the Long Term Incentive arrangement for certain Statutory Board members.
Phantom Share Units
Phantom Share Units
In 2010, a new equity-linked reward instrument was introduced as part of the Short-Term Incentive
(STI) plan. The short-term compensation in share-related awards consists of Phantom Share Units
(PSUs) and/or Restricted Phantom Share Units (RPSUs). RPSU awards are subject to a three-year
vesting with one third vesting each year on 1 April. The PSUs, whether vested or restricted, held by
the members of the Statutory Board are subject to a five-year retention period as measured from
the date of vesting. This short-term compensation can be converted into cash immediately after the
retention period.
The following table shows the holdings by members of the Statutory Board:

This section includes all financial assets subject to credit risk. Non-credit obligations fall under other
risk types, such as market risk, and equity is subject to investment risk. Figures may not always add up
due to rounding. The following portfolios that contain credit risk have been identified:
■ Corporate/Investment Loans;
■ Lease receivables;
■ Mortgage loans;
■ Debt Investments;
■ Cash Management;
■ Derivatives.

Table 56-1 presents the maximum credit risk exposure per portfolio, without taking collateral or any
other credit risk reduction into consideration. For all portfolios except derivatives, this is generally the
total commitment of NIBC, which also includes off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees
and undrawn credit lines.
The figures in table 56-1 are not directly comparable to the figures on the balance sheet. Corporate
and investment loans include off-balance sheet exposures and exclude exposures from NIBC Bank to
NIBC Holding. Mortgage loans are recognised on the balance sheet under mortgage loans own book
and securitised mortgage loans. Debt investments (securitisations) differ from the figure on the
balance sheet due to off-balance sheet exposures as disclosed in the Risk Management notes and due
to partial offsetting of risk exposure with liabilities to the same counterparties. The main difference in
the cash figures is due to collateral posting on credit risk differences for derivatives/repos.

NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based
(AIRB) approach for quantifying the credit quality of corporate and bank counterparties. The AIRB
methodology for corporate counterparties was approved by NIBC’s regulatory authority, the DNB, in
2008. In 2014, NIBC also received approval from the DNB to use the AIRB methodology for bank
counterparties.
Corporate loans
Corporate loan distribution
The industry sectors shown in tables 56-2 and 56-3 are based on internal NIBC sector organisation.
NIBC steers its business on internal sector classification, however it can be mapped to the industry
sectors of NACE classification, if necessary. For comparability purposes portfolio breakdown based
on NACE codes is also provided in a separate document published on NIBC’s annual report website.
Tables 56-2 and 56-3 display a breakdown of the Corporate Loan portfolio among regions and
industry sectors, at year-end 2017 and 2016. The Corporate Loan portfolio decreased by
EUR 266 million in 2017 to EUR 9,393 million mainly due to exposure decreases in the industry
sectors: Shipping & Intermodal (S&I) and Offshore Energy (OE). The relative weight of NIBC’s core
growth market the Netherlands increased, and the weight of the United Kingdom slightly increased.
The corporate loan portfolio in the Netherlands increased to 42% of the total exposure at
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 36%).

CRR/CRD IV and credit approval process
NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under Advanced Internal Ratings Based
(AIRB) approach for quantifying the credit quality of its Corporate Loan portfolio. In line with
CRR/CRD IV regulations, the methodology consists of three elements:
■ CCR, reflecting the PD of the borrower. The default definition is in line with the CRR/CRD IV
definition1
■ LGD, defined as an anticipated loss element that expresses the potential loss in the event of
default, which takes into account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ EAD, which is the amount that is expected to be outstanding at the moment a counterparty
defaults.
The PDs, LGDs and EADs that are calculated through NIBC's internal models are used for the
calculation of expected loss (EL) and CRR/CRD IV/Pillar 1 regulatory capital (RC). Economic
capital (EC), risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC), limit setting and stress testing are additional
areas which make use of these parameters, although the values and methodologies for both EC and
stress testing differ from those employed in Pillar 1. PDs, LGDs and EADs are also used in the
CRR/CRD IV solvency report to the regulator.
Annual backtests of the internal rating framework are carried out to assess the quality and the
performance of the models. The internal CCRs and LGDs are also benchmarked periodically with the
scales of external rating agencies.
NIBC enforces strict separation of responsibilities with respect to its internal rating methodologies
and rating process, model development, model validation and internal audit. The roles and
responsibilities of each department involved are explicitly set out in internal policies and manuals, also
in conformity with the stipulations of CRR/CRD IV on model governance. 
1 According to the CRR/CRD IV definition, a default is determined at the borrower level. A default is indicated by using a 9 or 10 rating in NIBC’s
internal rating scale. A default is considered to have occurred with respect to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events
have taken place: i) the bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the
bank to actions such as realising security (if held); ii) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group.
246 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
All approvals of individual credit proposals are granted after risk management has made a credit risk
assessment and has analysed proposals by taking into consideration, among others, aggregate limits
set per country, per industry segment, and per individual counterparty. The total one obligor
exposure and related exposure are also taken into account. Individual credit and transaction
proposals are then approved in the Transaction Committee (TC). Proposals, credit reviews and
amendments of smaller scale can be approved outside the TC by risk management. All
counterparties and, subsequently, all facilities, are reviewed at least once a year.
Credit ratings
NIBC uses an internal through-the-cycle CCR rating scale which consists of 10 grades (1-10) and a
total of 22 notches. The CCRs 9 and 10 are assigned to counterparties that have already defaulted
and therefore carry a PD of 100%.
The weighted average CCR of the non-defaulted clients remained stable during 2017 to 6+ with an
average PD of 1.9% at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 2.3%). The credit quality in terms of
CCRs remained concentrated in the sub-investment grade categories 5 and 6 (BB and B categories in
external rating agencies’ scales).
Graph 56-4 shows the distribution of the drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR.
The numbers on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s internal rating scale, whereas the letters in
parentheses refer to the equivalent rating scale of Standard & Poor’s. NR stands for not rateable,
which was a negligible portion of the corporate loans (0.2% at 31 December 2017; 0.1% at
31 December 2016). NR is assigned to entities for which NIBC’s corporate rating tools were not
suitable at the time of rating.

Collateral and LGD
NIBC's internal LGD scale consists of 7 grades (A-F) and 10 notches, each of which represents a
different degree of recovery prospects and loss expectations. LGD ratings are facility-specific. The
weighted average LGD remained stable at B-1 grade with an average LGD of 15.1% at 31 December
2017 (31 December 2016: 15.1%). The weighted average LGD is calculated for non-defaulted loans
and is weighted by exposure. Nearly all facilities within NIBC have some form of collateralisation,

resulting in LGDs concentrated in those LGD categories which correspond to high recoveries in the
range of 80% and 90%.

Note that the corporate loan exposure of graph 56-5 refers to non-defaulted exposure as the LGD
is a measure of anticipated loss for facilities of a non-defaulted counterparty. Once counterparty
enters default, the impairment amount becomes a more meaningful measure of the loss.
The most significant types of collateral securing the loan and derivative portfolios are tangible assets,
such as real estate, vessels, rigs and equipment. Exposures in the shipping and offshore energy sectors
are primarily secured by moveable assets such as vessels and drilling vessels. The commercial real
estate portfolio is primarily collateralised by mortgages on financed properties. Collateral value on a
going concern basis is estimated using third-party appraisers, whenever possible, or valuation
techniques based on common market practice. Realizable collateral value is determined as collateral
value after haircuts for factors such as business cycle, location, asset construction status or guarantor
counterparty rating. For example, loan-to-value ratios are regularly tested and vessels are appraised
semi-annually by external parties. Other commercial exposures are, to a large extent, collateralised
by assets such as inventory, debtors, lease and other receivables and third-party credit protection
(e.g. guarantees).
Arrears
The total arrears in the Corporate Loan portfolio to the total outstanding decreasead to 0.6% at
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 1.0%). An overview of the amounts in arrear per arrear
bucket is provided in tables 56-6 and 56-7. The exposure amounts refer to drawn and undrawn
amounts of those facilities with an arrear, whereas the outstanding amounts refer to the drawn
amounts only. The amounts in arrear are the actual amounts overdue at 31 December 2017 and
31 December 2016. The column labelled ‘Impairment Amount’ includes on-balance sheet impairment
amounts only (31 December 2017: EUR 126 million; 31 December 2016: EUR 175 million). The

inclusion of Incurred but not Reported (IBNR) impairment amounts (31 December 2017:

total impairment amount for 31 December 2017 to EUR 143 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 192 million). Loans that are impaired but do not have payment arrears represents restructured
loans which are now current with respect to payment obligations. Tables 56-11 and 56-12 provide

NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a loan carries a non-material arrear. If the total
arrear on facility level is lower than EUR 25,000 per facility, the age of the payment in arrear is below
30 days and the counterparty has not defaulted, then the arrear is considered insignificant. If arrears
fall within the threshold, the exposure is placed on the ‘no payment in arrear’ line on tables 56-6 and
56-7. The application of this threshold does not influence the total arrears, which amounted to
EUR 49 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 83 million).
Graph 56-8 displays the rating distribution of the exposure amounts (expressed as the sum of drawn
and undrawn amounts) of all loans with an amount in arrears. The total exposure amount at
31 December 2017 was EUR 184 million (31 December 2016: EUR 274 million) and the total drawn
amount at 31 December 2017 was EUR 184million (31 December 2016: EUR 240 million).

Forbearance and non-performing Corporate Loans
NIBC considers a client to be forborne if:
1. NIBC considers the obligor to be in financial difficulties,
2. NIBC grants a concession to the obligor.
Financial difficulties are defined as a debtor facing or about to face difficulties meeting financial
obligations. Concession refers to one of the following (per facility):
■ Modification of terms or conditions of a troubled facility to allow sufficient debt service capacity
(that would not be granted if the obligor were not in financial difficulties);
■ (partial) Refinancing of a troubled facility (that would not be granted without financial difficulties).
Tables 56-9 and 56-10 provide the total forborne outstanding in NIBC’s Corporate Loan portfolio
per industry sector and per region as at 31 December 2017. The forborne outstanding is divided in
performing and non-performing outstanding. NIBC considers a client non-performing if that client is
in default, or if a performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional forbearance
measures, or becomes more than 30 days past due. At the end of December 2017, EUR 7 million
non-performing outstanding was not forborne. Comparable figures for 2016 can be seen in Tables
56-11 and 56-12.
Impairments of forborne facilities (excluding IBNR) amounted to EUR 122 million at 31 December
2017, which represented 14% of the total forborne balances. The total impairments of the Corporate
Loan portfolio amounted to EUR 143 million at 31 December 2017, which represented 1.5% of the
total Corporate Loan portfolio of EUR 9.4 billion.

Impairment amounts
The Corporate Loan portfolio is reviewed by credit officers and risk management who monitor the
quality of counterparties and the related collateral. Formal assessment of the entire portfolio takes
place on a quarterly basis. All existing impairments are also reviewed. NIBC calculates an impairment
amount by taking various factors into account, particularly the available collateral securing the loan
and the corporate derivative exposure, if present. The loss amount is measured as the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows. If collateral
is present, then the present value of the future cash flows reflects the foreclosure of collateral. More
information on the method impairments are calculated is included in the Accounting Policies section.
NIBC determines a default at counterparty level, whereas an impairment amount is taken at facility
level. When a default occurs, the entire exposure and outstanding amount of the borrower are
classified as defaulted. If, however, an impairment amount is taken on a facility, only the exposure
amount of that particular facility is classified as impaired.
In 2017, the total write-offs (EUR 52 million) increased compared to 2016 (EUR 30million), mainly in
the industry & manufacturing, shipping and offshore energy sectors. The stock of impairments
decreased and amounted to EUR 143 million at year-end 2017 (year-end 2016: EUR 192 million).
Tables 56-13 and 56-14 display an overview of impairments at 31 December 2017 and 31 December
2016, subdivided in industry sectors and regions, respectively. The column labelled ‘Exposure’ includes

Corporate loans without impairments or arrears
At 31 December 2017, the size of the corporate loan exposure carrying neither impairments nor
arrears equalled EUR 9,005 million or 96% of the total Corporate Loan portfolio (31 December
2016: EUR 8,900 million or 92%). Graph 56-15 displays the distribution of exposure amounts without
impairments or arrears, at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. Of this exposure 94% is
rated in CCR categories 4, 5 and 6 (BBB, BB and B categories in external rating agencies’ scales). NR
represents a negligible part of the portfolio (31 December 2017: 0.2% of all loans without
impairments or amounts in arrear; 31 December 2016: 0.1%).

Country risk
Country risk is the risk that an entity defaults due to political, social, economical or financial turmoil in
its applicable jurisdiction(s). Country risk can potentially be an important cause of increased
counterparty default risk since a large number of individual debtors could default at the same time.
NIBC did not experience any counterparty defaults from this risk in 2017.
Investment loans
Investment loans are originated and monitored separately from the Corporate Loan portfolio.
Investment loans are typically (unsecured) subordinated loans that contain equity characteristics such
as attached warrants or conversion features. As such, investment loans typically carry a higher risk
profile than corporate loans. Examples of these loans include mezzanine loans, convertible loans and
shareholder loans.
The investment loan can be divided into indirect investments and direct investments. Indirect
investments are investments made through funds (NIBC Funds). Direct investments are all other
investments.
Direct investments or commitments in NIBC Funds are approved by the Investment Committee (IC)
of NIBC. Indirect investments are approved by the investment committees of the NIBC Funds,
subject to the investment guidelines stipulated in the fund agreements between the manager of the
NIBC Fund and the investors.
Investment officers monitor the quality of counterparties in the portfolio on a regular basis. On a
quarterly basis, the entire Investment Loan portfolio is assessed for impairment. All existing
impairments are reviewed. Impairments of indirect investments are determined by the manager of
the NIBC Fund. All impairments are reviewed and approved by the IC.
The total size of investment loans at 31 December 2017 was EUR 220 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 246 million), of which 91% had been drawn (31 December 2016: 91%). In line with the
characteristics of the asset class, investment loans typically carry riskier internal CCRs and often a
higher LGD than corporate loans. At 31 December 2017, the weighted average counterparty credit
rating of non-defaulted investment loans remained stable at an internal rating 6 (31 December 2016:
6) on NIBC’s internal rating scale (equivalent to B on external rating agencies’ scales).

Lease receivables
In 2014, NIBC obtained a leasing portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Gallinat-Bank AG in
Germany. This is a static portfolio and strict criteria were in place to determine the eligibility of lease
contracts for this programme. These were entered into with German lessees to finance moveable
objects such as trucks and trailers. The contracts are to commercial clients in the German SME
market and consist of hire purchase contracts, partially amortising and fully amortising lease contracts.
The servicing of this portfolio remains with the leasing company. The portfolio is financed by NIBC
via a ring-fenced structure benefiting from credit enhancement. At the end of December 2017, the
leasing portfolio continues to decrease from the original EUR 221 million to EUR 60 million.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio
The Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of owner occupied mortgages. These contain
NIBC Direct loans originated by business partners since 2013, as well as white label mortgage loans
that were also originated by business partners till 2009. Buy-to-Let (NIBC Vastgoed Hypotheek)
mortgages for investors were started in January 2015 and continued to show strong growth in 2017.
This niche currently comprises approximately 7% of the total mortgage portfolio. Servicing and
administration of the mortgage portfolio is outsourced to third-party servicers. Acceptance and
special servicing is performed in-house.
At 31 December 2017, 29% of the Mortgage loan portfolio (31 December 2016: 33%) had a Dutch
government guarantee (NHG guarantee) in accordance with the general terms and conditions set by
the Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woningen (WEW, Social Housing Guarantee Fund).
A part of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio has been securitised to obtain funding. NIBC generally
retains the junior notes and other positions related to these securitisation programmes. As a result
the securitisation programmes are consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet. The total amount of the
retained positions at 31 December 2017 was EUR 26.5 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 135 million).
Risk governance Dutch Mortgages loans
In order to control the credit risk in the origination of residential mortgage loans, an acceptance
policy framework was formulated to screen residential mortgage applications. Acceptance depends
on the following underwriting criteria:
■ Conformity with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Credits of the Dutch Bankers Association
where applicable;
■ A check of an applicant’s credit history with the Dutch National Credit Register (Bureau Krediet
Registratie or BKR), a central credit agency used by financial institutions in the Netherlands, which
records five years of financial commitments and negative credit events;
■ Mortgage loans are secured by first-ranking mortgage rights;
■ Other criteria, such as type of property, maximum Loan-To-Market Value (LTMV), maximum Loan-
to-Income (LTI) and minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR);and
■ Underwriting criteria for mortgages with an NHG guarantee are set in accordance with the
general terms and conditions set by the WEW. The WEW finances itself by a one-off up-front
charge to the borrower as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan. The NHG
guarantee covers losses on the outstanding principal, accrued unpaid interest, and disposal costs,
caused by foreclosure.
In 2017, the following amendments were implemented:
■ The maximum NHG guaranteed loan amount stayed at EUR 245 thousand.
■ Maximum Loan-to-Value decreased to 101% in 2017 for owner occupied mortgages. For buy-to-
let mortgages, maximum LTMV in rented state is currently 70% (not regulated by law)
Management of loans in arrears Dutch Mortgages loans
In order to control the credit risk in the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio, NIBC has established
procedures to manage all loan amounts in arrears. All amounts in arrears are managed in-house. This
ensures a dedicated team focused on preventing and minimising credit losses. The Special Servicing
Mortgages team is responsible for arrears, client retention, foreclosures, collecting remaining debts
and visiting clients and properties that serve as collateral.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 257
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The special servicing at NIBC is focused on intensive contact with its mortgage clients and tailor-
made solutions. When amounts in arrears occur, the borrower receives a letter after the first day of
arrears. Within one week, the client is contacted by phone. Depending on the outcome of these
contacts, a customer-specific approach is formulated on a case-by-case basis. Customer visits are
made if arrears reach two months. In case of defaults, the Special Servicing team has to submit the
file to the Arrears Management Committee for approval of the strategy to be followed. The Arrears
Management Committee includes members from Risk Management, Operations, Portfolio
Management and the Special Servicing team. NIBC bids for own foreclosed properties at auctions to
ensure the proceeds are at arm’s length. If needed, NIBC acquires these properties.
NIBC has introduced a programme where vulnerable customers that may face potential future
financial difficulties are approached pro-actively with the intention of identifying and resolving
difficulties before actual arrears arise.
Table 56-22 shows the arrears overview of the total Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December
2017 and 31 December 2016. Overall, the notional amount in arrears decreased compared to year
end 2016 while the portfolio volume has grown with 4%.

Forbearance Dutch Mortgage loans
NIBC has developed a forbearance policy for mortgage clients experiencing financial difficulties and
who consequently are unable to meet the original terms and conditions of the contract. The
forbearance policy is defined, formalized and implemented in the standard working routines and
processes and is similar to the policy applied for the corporate loan portfolio.
NIBC has been providing a forbearance program to its mortgagers who are experiencing financial
difficulties since May 2013. The Client Retention team of the Special Servicing department has the
responsibility of assessing the nature and the expected duration of a client’s financial distress, and will
determine necessity of providing forbearance measures to that client and the conditions that should
apply. The team considers forbearance solutions for clients who do not fully meet their financial
obligations to NIBC. Forbearance solutions are also submitted to the Arrears Management
Committee for further approval. At
31 December 2016, EUR 38 million was forborne of which EUR 23 million was performing and
EUR 15 million non-performing. At 31 December 2017, EUR 41 million was reported as forborne of
which EUR 25 million was performing and EUR 16 million non-performing.
258 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk measurement Dutch Mortgage loans
NIBC’s rating methodology for residential mortgage loans has been used for determining regulatory
capital requirements since 2008. The calculation of PD, LGD and EAD for owner- occupied
mortgages is performed by an internally-developed CRR/CRD IV AIRB model (for Buy-to-Let
mortgages, Basel standardized approach for credit risk is used).
The PD estimates are dependent on a variety of factors, of which the key factors are debt- to-
income and loan-to-value ratios. Minor factors that play a role in the PD estimates are several other
mortgage loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and payment performance information. The
PD scale is based on a continuous scale ranging from 0-100%.
The LGD estimates are based on a downturn scenario comparable to the downturn in the Dutch
mortgage market in the 1980s. In this case, the indexed collateral value is stressed in order to
simulate the proceeds of a sale or foreclosure of the collateral. The stress is dependent on the
location and the absolute value of the collateral. Together with cost and time-to-foreclosure
assumptions, an LGD is derived. The LGD estimate also takes into account whether a mortgage loan
has an NHG guarantee, in which case the LGD estimate will be lower in comparison to a mortgage
loan without the NHG guarantee. The LGD estimate is also based on a continuous scale.
The validation of these estimates is performed on historical data and is carried out annually. For the
PD and LGD, the estimates are back tested against realised defaults and realised losses. In this way, it
is ensured that the model functions correctly in a changing economic environment. Moreover, NIBC is
closely following recent regulatory proposals regarding to adjust capital requirements under
standardized approach and introducing capital floors.
Impairment amounts are not calculated on individual residential mortgage loans but, rather, calculated
on the portfolio level of the residential mortgage loans.
Table 56-23 shows the PD distribution of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2017
and 31 December 2016. A PD of 100% means that a borrower is close to or more than 90 days in
arrears.

Risk mitigation and collateral management Dutch Mortgage loans
Credit losses are mitigated in a number of ways:
■ The underlying property is pledged as collateral;
■ 29% of the Dutch Own Book portfolio and 8% of the Securitised portfolio are covered by the
NHG programme; and
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 259
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ For the part of the Dutch portfolio that has been securitised, credit losses higher than the retained
positions, excess spread and reserve accounts are attributable to investors in the securitisation
programmes.
For the portfolio not covered by the NHG programme, the underlying property is the primary
collateral for any mortgage loan granted, though savings, life insurance and investment deposits may
also serve as additional collateral.
An indicator for potential losses, taking into account indexation of house prices and seasoning, is the
Loan-to-Indexed-Market-Value (LTIMV). The indexation is made by using the CBS/Kadaster index,
which is based on market observables. The Kadaster (national property register) is a public
government register of real estate and their vested rights (e.g. ownership and mortgages). This
register contains transaction data as well as CBS (Statistics Netherlands) data, which are used to
construct a pricing index. Graphs 56-24 and 56-25 show a breakdown of the LTIMV for the total
Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. The average
seasoning of the total portfolio is approximately 8 years. The increase in the NHG guaranteed
category is due to new origination of NIBC Direct mortgages. 5% of the total portfolio has an LTIMV
above 100%. For the remainder of the portfolio, the indexed collateral value is less than or equal to
the nominal loan balance outstanding or is a NHG mortgage.

German Mortgage loan portfolio
The German Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to EUR 53 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: EUR 84 million). The collateral value of this portfolio amounted to
EUR 95 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 139 million). The majority of this
260 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
portfolio was acquired from third parties via two portfolio purchases. The purchased portfolios
contain highly seasoned loans with low LTMV.
As is the case in the Netherlands, the underlying property is the primary collateral for the granted
mortgage loan. The majority of mortgage loans in Germany contain an annuity debt profile, leading
to a lower outstanding balance during the lifetime of the loan.
Debt investments
NIBC defines credit risk in debt investments as issuer risk, which is the credit risk of losing the
principal amount on products such as bonds. Issuer risk is calculated based on the book value.
Risk monitoring and measurement
Risk is controlled by setting single issuer limits and, in some cases, programme limits. All single issuer
limits are approved by the TC or by delegated authority to the FMCR department. Apart from single
issuer limits, risk is also monitored by assessing credit spread risk. Both sensitivity analysis (basis point
values, BPVs) and Value at Risk (VaR) numbers are used2.
Note 58 on Market Risk contains more information on these variables.
In the remainder of this section, the exposure has been divided into the following two sub-portfolios:
■ Debt from financial institutions, corporate entities and sovereigns; and
■ Securitisations.
Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities
NIBC invests in debt (bonds) issued by financial institutions and corporate entities. The size of this
sub-portfolio decreased in the course of 2017 to EUR 324 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: EUR 459 million). Of the total exposure, 30% (31 December 2016: 37%) were
covered bonds. The remaining 70% (31 December 2016: 63%) was senior unsecured debt.
In 2014, NIBC began to use internal ratings to assess the creditworthiness of a financial institution. In
general debt investments are rated more conservative by NIBC than by the external rating agencies.
The amount of EUR 324 million at 31 December 2017 represents the maximum credit risk exposure,
without taking into account the presence of any collateral that could be repossessed in case of
default. The portfolio did not contain any credit default swap (CDS) exposures.

At both 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the portfolio of debt from financial institutions
and corporate entities had no impairments and contained no arrears.
Securitisations
NIBC has been an active participant on the securitisation market in the past decade, both as an
originator and investor in securitisations.
Tables 56-29 and 56-30 present an overview of NIBC’s total securitisation exposure resulting from its
activities as investor in securitisations. The exposure relating to NIBC’s activities as an originator can
be split into exposures related to consolidated and non-consolidated securitisations. If a securitisation
programme is consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet, the exposure to the underlying collateral is
excluded from the securitisation exposure and included in the total exposures presented in note 60
on credit risk in the corporate loans or mortgage loans sections. NIBC’s total exposure as an
originator to consolidated securitisations was EUR 206 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December
2016: EUR 224 million).
NIBC distinguishes two Securitisation sub-portfolios: the portfolio of Western European
Securitisations and the Liquidity Investments portfolio.
NIBC’s total securitisation exposure (investor and non-consolidated originator) decreased to
EUR 498 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 773 million), mainly due to a
decrease of the Western European Securitisations portfolio.
The portfolio of investments in Western European securitisations contains NIBC’s investor
securitisations in Western Europe as well as all investments in NIBC’s own non-consolidated
securitisations. All investments in NIBC’s own securitisations are subject to approval from both Risk
Management and Finance. The total amount of the portfolio of investments in Western Europe
decreased to EUR 74 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 256 million). The
Liquidity Investments portfolio was set up to invest part of NIBC’s excess liquidity in the securitisation
market. Investments are in majority AAA rated RMBS transactions backed by Dutch collateral or
European ABS and are eligible to be pledged as collateral with the European Central Bank (ECB).
Apart from the strict mandate, each investment is pre-approved by FMCR. Exposure in this portfolio
decreased to EUR 424 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 518 million). The
underlying assets in the collateral pools of NIBC’s securitisation investments comprise Dutch
residential mortgage loans (NL-RMBS AAA Liquidity Portfolio) and French and German car loans and
credit card receivables (EU-ABS AAA Liquidity Portfolio).

Geographic distribution of securitisations
Graph 56-31 presents the distribution of the Securitisations portfolio by geographic region at
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. NIBC allocates exposure to a region based on the
geographic location in which the cash flows are generated. The geographic distribution illustrates that
the majority of these assets are located in Western Europe, mainly in the Netherlands (64%),
Germany (16%) and the United Kingdom (7%). NIBC’s exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal is
limited and had decreased to EUR 18 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016:
EUR 44 million). Approximately 93% of this exposure is investment grade exposure. NIBC had no
exposure in Greece at 31 December 2017 or 2016.

Impairments on securitisations
The majority of the Securitisations portfolio is reported at amortised cost or available for sale for
accounting purposes and the respective assets are subject to a quarterly impairment analysis.
Impairments are taken when the expected future cashflows are insufficient to meet the payment
obligaitons. The stock of impairments decreased to EUR 24 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: EUR 47 million).
Securitisations without impairments
Table 56-32 presents the rating breakdown of securitisation exposure that did not carry an

Cash management
NIBC is exposed to credit risk as a result of cash management activities. In 2017, NIBC’s risk
management framework for cash management continued its conservative approach, taking into
account the vulnerable financial markets.
Risk monitoring and measurement
NIBC places its excess cash with the DNB/Dutch State Treasury Agency and with a selected number
of investment-grade financial institutions. A monitoring process is in place within the FMCR
department for the approved financial institutions. Cash management exposures can be collateralised
through reverse repo transactions or unsecured through interbank deposits and current accounts.
Correspondent banking and third-party account providers
Apart from the exposure in cash management, NIBC holds foreign currency accounts at
correspondent banks and also utilises third-party account providers for internal securitisations.
Exposures
At 31 December 2017, NIBC’s total cash amounted EUR 2,021 million (31 December 2016:
EUR 1,371 million). EUR 1,604 million of the cash was held at DNB and Deutsche Bundesbank,
EUR 403 million at financial institutions and the remaining EUR 14 million at corporate entities
(securitisation-related liquidity facilities).

At year-end 2017, EUR 627 million cash collateral has been excluded from the cash management
exposure (year-end 2016: EUR 1,016 million) as this amount is restricted cash that relates to
derivatives with a negative fair value. At both 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, this
portfolio carried no impairments and no arrears.
Credit risk in derivatives
Credit risk in derivatives is the risk of having to replace the counterparty in derivative contracts.
NIBC’s credit risk in derivatives can be split into exposures to financial institutions and corporate
entities. NIBC’s policy is to minimise this risk. NIBC only enters into OTC contracts with central
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 265
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
clearing counterparties and financial institutions that are investment grade or with corporate entities
where the exposure is secured by some form of collateral.
Risk monitoring and measurement
Credit risk in derivatives is based on the marked-to-market value and Potential Future Exposure (PFE)
of the derivative. The PFE reflects a potential future change in marked-to- market value during the
remaining lifetime of the derivative contract. For financial institutions, separate limits for credit risk are
in place, based on the external rating. For corporate clients, NIBC enters into a derivative transaction
as part of its overall relationship with the client. The credit approval process for these derivatives is
closely linked with the credit approval process of the loan. Limit-setting proposals for both financial
institutions and corporate counterparties are reviewed in the TC. For financial institutions, collateral
postings under a CSA are taken into account. In 2017 NIBC offsetted assets and liabilities with central
clearing members. Derivatives with the same characteristics, being counterparty, maturity bucket and
currency are netted. In 2017, EUR 244 million of NIBC’s derivative portfolio including netting, but
excluding collateral and PFE has been centrally cleared. For corporate counterparties, both the loan
and derivative are treated as a single package whereby the derivative often benefits from the security/
collateral supporting the loan exposure.
Exposures
Tables 56-36 and 56-37 display NIBC exposures from credit risk in derivatives allocated across the
rating class of the underlying counterparty. Exposure is the sum of the positive marked-to-market
value of derivative contracts, excluding the effect of netting and collateral exchange. Due to
amortisation and limit origination, the total derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral
decreased in 2017 to EUR 1,021 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016:
EUR 1,817 million).

Collateral
To the extent possible, NIBC attempts to limit credit risk arising from derivatives. NIBC enters into
bilateral collateral agreements with financial institutions to mitigate credit risk in OTC derivatives by
means of CSAs. Positive marked-to-market values can be netted with negative marked-to-market
values (as in tables 56-38 and 56-39) and the remaining exposure is mitigated through bilateral
collateral settlements. Accepted collateral is mainly cash collateral, which is usually exchanged on a
266 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
daily basis. The primary counterparties in these CSAs are large international banks with ratings of A
or higher. NIBC generally carries out daily cash collateral exchanges to account for changes in the
market value of the contracts included in the CSA.
Terms and conditions of these CSAs are in line with general International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) credit support documents. Collateral from CSAs significantly decreases the credit
exposure on derivatives, as presented in table 56-38 at 31 December 2017 and in table 56-39 at
December 2017.

Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit and debt value adjustments)
CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of the
counterparty as well as the own default risk of NIBC. The adjustments are applied to all OTC
derivative contracts, except for those that benefit from a solid collateral agreement where cash
collateral is regularly exchanged, mitigating the credit risk. In practice, this means that CVA and DVA
are only applied to OTC derivative contracts that generate credit risk on corporate (i.e. non-financial)
counterparties.
Arrears
NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a derivative carries a non-material arrear. The
criteria for this threshold are the same as for the portfolio of corporate loans. If amounts in arrear fall
below the threshold (EUR 100,000), they are considered insignificant and are therefore excluded.
The application of the threshold does not influence the total arrears for 2017 and 2016.
Table 56-40 displays an overview of the arrears for corporate derivatives at 31 December 2017 and
31 December 2016 as well as the exposures (marked-to-market values) these arrears refer to. There
were no amounts in arrear for derivatives with financial institutions. As shown in Table 56-40, at
31 December 2017, no marked-to-market exposure in arrear (31 December 2016: no marked-to-
market expsoure in arrear).

57 Interest rate risk in the Banking book
NIBC defines interest rate risk in the Banking book (IRRBB) as the risk of losses from interest rate
sensitive positions in non-trading activities due to movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is
measured both from an economic value perspective and an earnings perspective. The first
perspective considers the impact on the market value, while the latter considers the impact on the
net interest income.
NIBC’s banking book consists of:
■ Corporate treasury
■ Commercial Treasury
■ Corporate banking
■ Retail banking
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for IRRBB from an economic value perspective is measured by the modified
duration of equity and equal to 5 (with a tolerance of 7.5), while the risk appetite from an earnings
perspective is measured by the impact on 1Y earnings and equal to EUR 13 million (assuming a shift
in interest rates of 100 bps).
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest Basis Point Value (BPV) and interest Value at Risk (VaR) measures are
calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the Market Risk department:
■ Interest BPV measures the sensitivity of the market value to an instantaneous change of one basis
point in each time bucket of the interest rate curve. The BPV as displayed in the tables below
represents the sensitivity of the market value to a one-basis-point, parallel upward shift of the
underlying curve;
■ The interest VaR measures the threshold value, which daily marked-to-market losses with a
confidence level of 99% will not exceed, based on four years of historical data for weekly changes
in interest rates. These weekly changes are superimposed on the current market rates. The VaR is
calculated by means of full valuation to take non-linearity into account.
268 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
From the earnings perspective changes in interest rates occur both instantaneously and gradually over
time. The combination of static and dynamic (changes to the current portfolio composition) analyses
are used. The dynamic analysis allows the integration of the business strategy in the earnings, by
aligning the development of the balance sheet with the business plan, taking into account both
refinancing and reinvestments. Earnings at risk (EatR) is calculated by means of the following measure:
■ 12 months earnings impact due to a 200 bps gradual upwards or downwards interest rate shock
per currency
EatR as displayed in the tables below represents the 200 bps gradual upwards measure.
The interest rate risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as
stress testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future
events.
Limits are set on the above measures, both those from the economic value perspective and from an
earnings perspective. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once every two weeks.
Any major breach of IRRBB limits is reported to the CRO immediately.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk in the Banking book
Interest rate risk in the Banking book from an economic value perspective is mainly present in the
Mismatch book and the Mortgages book; note that the books have opposite interest rate risk
positions from an economic value perspective.
NIBC accepts a certain economic value risk exposure in the Mismatch book to stabilize earnings. We
call this our strategic mismatch exposure. If we would not have this exposure and hedge all our
interest bearing assets and liabilities to 3-months Euribor/Libor, our (non-interest bearing) capital will
effectively be financing very short-term assets and the interest return on our (non-interest bearing)
capital will fluctuate with these short term rates earned on those assets.
The Mismatch book exclusively contains swaps in EUR and GBP as these are, next to USD, the major
currencies in which also lending activities take place. The USD position (31 million EUR) in the
Mismatch book was closed in Q4 2017 as future increases in interest rates might result in negative
carry. At year-end of 2017 the total notional position is 427 EUR mln, with 58% of the mismatch
position held in EUR, 42% in GBP and 0% in USD. Duration based the relative positions would be
57% in EUR, 43% in GBP, 0% in USD.
The Mortgage loan book consists of:
■ The 'old' (white label) mortgage portfolio, 4.9 billion EUR of which 53 million EUR in Germany.
This portfolio is accounted on fair value. The hedging strategy of this book is based upon the
interest rate sensitivity, including a discount spread.
■ In 2013 NIBC started originating mortgages under the NIBC Direct label and this portfolio grew
significantly since then. At year-end 2016 this portfolio’s size was 3.3 billion EUR and at year-end
2017 the size of this portfolio is 4.4 billion EUR. This portfolio is accounted on amortised cost.
The hedging strategy of this book is based upon notional amounts, i.e. excluding a discount spread.
However the interest rate sensitivity (from an economic value perspective) of both books is
measured identically, i.e. by taking into account a discount spread.

NIBC defines market risk as:
■ the risk of losses in the Trading book arising from adverse movements in market rates and;
■ the risk of losses in the Banking Book from NIBC’s credit spread risk position and;
■ the risk of losses in both the banking and trading book from adverse movements in currencies
with respect to the Euro.
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk and credit spread risk .
In Money Markets & Trading, NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and USD yield
curves. This book also contains interest rate risk related to derivative transactions of NIBC’s clients.
All positions within NIBC Markets are part of the Trading book. The Trading book of NIBC Markets
contains bonds and a relatively small equity portfolio in those equities, for which NIBC markets is
liquidity provider.
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for market risk is moderate. For all market risk types limits are set and monitored
on a daily basis.
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest and credit spread Basis Point Value (BPV) and interest and credit
spread and equity Value at Risk (VaR) measures are calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the
Market Risk department. VaR is calculated using 4 years of historical data and a confidence level of
99%.
The market risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as stress
testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future events.
Limits are set on the above measures. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once
every two weeks. Any major breach of market risk limits is reported to the CRO immediately.

Currency risk
NIBC manages its overall currency position based on the currency positions in the monthly balance
sheets. The main exposures in foreign currencies for NIBC are USD, GBP and JPY. NIBC uses
matched funding and other measures to apply its policy of not taking any currency positions. Any
currency position which does show at month end is caused by movements in the fair value of assets
or liabilities or interest income in foreign currencies and is hedged by entering into FX spot
transactions. The total open foreign currency position, by nominal amount, was EUR 3.5 million at

year-end 2017. This currency position is the position prior to hedging, which is always done shortly
after month-end. Regulatory capital for currency risk is equal to 0.9 million EUR per end of 2017.
Furthermore, the impact of a reasonably possible yearly change (in absolute terms) of EUR against
other currencies was calculated. Per end of 2017 the impact of these reasonably possible changes is
as follows for NIBC (only currencies with the larger exposures are displayed).

59 Liquidity risk
NIBC defines liquidity risk as the inability of NIBC to fund its assets and meet its obligations as they
become due, at acceptable cost.
Maintaining a sound liquidity and funding profile is one of NIBC’s most important risk management
objectives. NIBC analyses its funding profile by mapping all assets and liabilities into time buckets that
correspond to their maturities. Based on projections prepared by the business units and reviewed by
Risk Management, and the current asset and liability maturity profiles, several liquidity stress tests are
prepared and presented once every two weeks to the ALCO, in order to create continuous
monitoring of the liquidity position.
Assumptions
One of the stress scenarios, the market-wide stress test, assumes a world-wide liquidity shortage in
which no new market funding can be attracted by NIBC. Furthermore, it is assumed that assets
cannot be sold, but that they can only be made liquid by making them eligible for collateralised and
ECB funding. In addition, the following assumptions are made:
■ In order to maintain NIBC’s business franchise, it is assumed that new corporate loan production
continues at a level where the current books are maintained constant;
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to for example collateral cash outflows (payments from
CSAs) and drawdowns of undrawn commitments are made; and
■ A one notch downgrade is assumed.
The projection of NIBC’s liquidity in this way is necessarily a subjective process and requires
management to make assumptions about, for example, the fair value of eligible collateral and
potential outflow of cash collateral placed by NIBC with derivative counterparties.
In light of these projections, NIBC is confident that sufficient liquidity is available to meet maturing
obligations over the next 12 months.
Maturity calendar consolidated balance sheet
The following tables present the cash flows payable by NIBC in respect of non-derivative financial
liabilities relevant for liquidity risk by the remaining contractual maturities at 31 December. The
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 273
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amounts disclosed in the tables for the non-derivative financial liabilities are contractual future
undiscounted cash flows. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are therefore restated
to future nominal amounts. The financial assets relevant for managing liquidity risk are based on the
fair value (discounted cash flows) for those assets which are classified at fair value through profit or
loss or available-for-sale.
The differences between the table and the stress scenario are caused mainly by the following items
that are included in the stress scenario analysis but not in the maturity calendar of the consolidated
balance sheet:
■ New asset production;
■ Collateralised funding capacity of internal securitisations and individual bonds; and
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to possible cash outflows (e.g. CSA collateral, callable
funding).

60 Capital management
Overview
It is NIBC’s policy to maintain a strong capital base, to meet regulatory capital requirements at all
times and to support the development of its business by allocating capital efficiently. Allocation of
capital to the business is based on an EC approach. EC is the amount of capital which NIBC allocates
as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based upon its assessment of risks. The EC
that NIBC allocates to each business is based on the assessment of risk of its activities. It differs from
the CRR/CRDIV capital requirements, i.e. regulatory capital, as in certain cases NIBC assesses the
specific risk characteristics of its business activities in a different way than the CRR/CRDIV method.
Total regulatory capital however, in combination with a minimum benchmark Tier 1 ratio, does form
a limit to the maximum amount of EC that can be allocated to the business.
Comparing the risk-based EC of each business to its profit delivers a RAROC for each business. EC
and RAROC are key tools in NIBC's capital allocation and usage process, assisting in allocating Own
Funds as efficiently as possible, based on expectations of both risks and return. Usage of EC is
assessed once every two weeks in the ALCO. The ALCO resets the maximum allocation level of EC
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 277
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
to and within each business, taking into account business expectations, NIBC's desired risk profile and
the regulatory requirements.
Methodology
NIBC uses the business model of each activity as the basis for determining the EC. If the business
model of an activity is trading, distribution or investing for a limited period, a market risk approach
based upon VaR and scaled to a one-year horizon is used to calculate the EC usage. A business
model based on 'buy-to-hold' or investing to maturity leads to a credit risk approach being applied,
based upon estimations of PD and LGD. Add-ons for operational risk and country risk are also
calculated. Furthermore, NIBC allocates EC for business risk, reputation risk and model risk on a
group-wide level.
The EC approach differs from the CRR/CRDIV approach in which only the trading books are
assigned a market risk approach. In the CRR/CRDIV framework, activities that are not trading but
have a business model based on distribution or investment for a limited period are often assigned a
credit risk approach, following CRR/CRDIV regulations or regulatory industry practice, whereas in the
EC framework NIBC applies a market risk approach similar to that of the trading activities. Risks and
EC are monitored accordingly.
The main differences between the EC capital and CRR/CRDIV framework come from the Residential
Mortgage portfolio, the Securitisations portfolio and NIBC’s interest rate mismatch position. EC is
determined by a market risk approach for these activities. The CRR/CRDIV approach is either a
credit risk approach (mortgage loans and securitisations) or is not part of the CRR/CRD IV Pillar 1 at
all (mismatch position).
Capital allocation
NIBC allocates EC to all its business activities in the form of limits set by the ALCO and calculates the
amount of EC usage of each business based on the risk of its activities:
■ For the Corporate Loan portfolio, NIBC calculates EC usage by means of a credit risk approach
largely based upon the CRR regulatory capital formula and an add-on for concentration risk;
■ For the Debt Investments and Trading portfolios, the Residential Mortgage portfolio and the
interest rate mismatch position, NIBC uses a market risk approach to determine EC usage. EC
usage for these portfolios is calculated using VaR, calculated with four years of historical data and
scaled to a one-year horizon;
■ For the Investment loans, NIBC calculates EC usage by applying a credit approach based upon the
CRR regulatory capital formula. NIBC uses fixed percentages for the equity investments.
CRR/CRDIV regulatory capital
The objective of CRR/CRDIV is to enhance the capital adequacy of the banking industry by making it
more responsive to risk. CRR/CRDIV is structured on three pillars:
■ Pillar 1 describes the capital adequacy requirements for three risk types; credit risk, market risk and
operational risk;
■ Pillar 2 describes the additional supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), where regulators
analyse the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) of the individual banks. Since the
end of 2011, Dutch Central Bank also analyses the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process
(ILAAP);
■ In Pillar 3 the required risk reporting standards are displayed, supporting additional market
discipline in the international capital markets.
278 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Under CRR/CRDIV and subject to approval from the regulator, banks have the option to choose
between various approaches, each with a different level of sophistication in risk management, ranging
from ‘standardised’ to ‘advanced’.
For credit risk, NIBC adopted the AIRB approach as further specified in CRR/CRDIV for its
corporate, retail and institutional exposure classes. NIBC started using the AIRB approach at
1 January 2008. A small residue of exposures is measured on the standardised approach.
For market risk, NIBC adopted an internal model VaR approach.
For measuring operational risk, NIBC adopted the standardised approach, which is based on
prescribed business-line activities.
The basis for Pillar 2 is NIBC’s ICAAP, which is NIBC’s self-assessment of risks sufficiently captured by
Pillar 1, i.e. the link between NIBC's risk profile, its risk management and risk mitigation, and NIBC's
capital planning.
Under Pillar 3, NIBC publishes its regulatory disclosures regarding its capital structure, capital
adequacy, liquidity risk, risk management objectives/policies and risk-weighted assets each year. The
Pillar 3 disclosures are published on the same date as the Annual Report on our website.
The following table displays the composition of regulatory capital as at 31 December 2017 and
31 December 2016.The regulatory capital is based on the CRR/CRDIV scope of consolidation,
calculated for NIBC Bank consolidated on a fully loaded base and including the full year profit after of
the year. The full year profit after tax is included without permission of DNB. NIBC Bank complies
with the CRR/CRDIV capital requirements, which formally requires a minimum Common Equity ratio
(including capital buffer) of 9.75%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio (including capital buffer) of 11.25% and a
minimum Total Capital ratio (including capital buffer) of 13.25%.

Changes in Dutch fiscal unity regime as a result of Justice of the European Union
Judgement
On 22 February 2018, the Justice of the European Union decided that certain elements of the Dutch
fiscal unity regime for corporate income tax purposes violate the freedom of establishment and are
therefore contrary to European Union law. As a result, previously announced emergency legislation
will change the Dutch fiscal unity regime, with retroactive effect, from 25 October 2017. The wording
of this reparatory legislation is expected in the second quarter of 2018. This reparatory legislation
may have impact on group companies within the fiscal unity NIBC. Although the various Dutch rules
on restrictions of interest deductions will be applicable for group companies of a fiscal unity as from
25 October 2017, the impact for 2017 is immaterial. As soon as the final reparatory legislation is
available an impact analysis will be performed by NIBC. and to the extent possible measures will be
taken to mitigate potential negative effects.

COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the company financial statements are
set out in the consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all
the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Where necessary, comparative figures have been
adjusted to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.
The company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements for
financial statements contained in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. NIBC applies the
provisions in Section 362, paragraph 8, Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code that make it
possible to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies
(including those for the presentation of financial instruments as equity or liability) used in its
consolidated financial statements.
The company financial statements are presented in euros rounded to the nearest million. The euro is
the functional and presentation currency of NIBC .
Summary of significant accounting policies
Except as set forth below, the accounting policies applied in the company financial statements are the
same as those for the consolidated financial statements.
Interests in group companies
Interests in group companies, as defined in the Subsidiaries section in the basis of consolidation in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements, are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is
determined by measuring the assets, provisions, liabilities and income based on the accounting
policies used in the consolidated financial statements. The company’s share of its group companies
profits or losses is recognised in the income statement.
If losses of group companies that are attributable to the company exceed the carrying amount of the
interest in the group company (including separately presented goodwill, if any, and including other
unsecured receivables), further losses are not recognised unless the company has incurred obligations
or made payments on behalf of the group company to satisfy obligations of the group company. In
such a situation, NIBC recognises a provision up to the extent of its obligation.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Net interest income
Interest income consists of interest income on loans and advances to customers, interest-bearing
securities and other interest and similar income.
Interest expense consists of interest expense on liabilities, whether or not embodied in debt
securities, and derivatives, as well as commissions having an interest nature, penalty interest on early
redemptions, premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts on debts, whether or not embodied
in debt securities, not stated at fair value are recognised using the effective interest method, together
with the relevant interest expense.

Interest income from debt and other fixed-income instruments designated as held for trading or
designated at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in interest and similar income at the
effective interest rate.
The interest income includes a positive amount of EUR 5 million related to the Targeted Long-Term
Refinancing Operations programme (TLTRO II) of the ECB, as NIBC Holding expects to meet the
minimum net lending amount in the reference period, needed to receive the applicable discount rate
of 40bps.
Interest income includes negative interest from liabilities for an amount of EUR 35 million (2016:
EUR 40 million).
For the year ended 31 December 2017, interest expense related to deposits from customers
amounted to EUR 113 million (31 December 2016: EUR 170 million).
Interest expense includes negative interest from financial assets for an amount of EUR 62 million
(2016: EUR 38 million).

The decrease in salaries in 2017 can be explained by a decrease in the average number of FTEs,
mainly driven by the reorganisations within NIBC Markets and the IT department.
The number of FTEs increased from 543 at 31 December 2016 to 603 at 31 December 2017. The
number of FTEs employed outside of the Netherlands decreased from 54 at 31 December 2016 to

Fair value hedges of interest rate risk
The interest rate risk of financial assets with a fixed interest rate classified at available-for-sale or at
amortised costs are hedged with interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a fixed rate and
receives floating rates. Fair value hedge accounting is applied to these hedge relationships.
Interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate are used in fair
value hedges of fixed-interest rate liabilities (as far as not held for trading purposes or designated at
fair value through profit or loss).
The following table discloses the fair value of the swaps designated in fair value hedging relationships:

The deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured for all temporary differences using the liability
method. The effective tax rate in the Netherlands for measuring deferred tax is 25% (2016: 25%).
There were no changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in the effective tax
rate in the Netherlands. Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carry forward losses can only be
utilized if taxable profits are realised in the future. To measure deferred tax assets, NIBC takes a
prudent approach regarding future compensation of carry forward losses. On 31 December 2017
there was a realistic expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be generated within the
applicable periods for the recognised deferred tax asset.

27 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-

interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.
The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table
by category. In the following table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced.
The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would
be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.

Contract amount:
Undrawn facilities and capital commitments 1,377 1,241
Guarantees and letters of credit 60 77

These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC's policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 48 of the consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees within the meaning of Section 403 Title 9 of Book 2, of the Netherlands Civil Code have
been given on behalf of De Nationale Maatschappij voor Industriële Financieringen B.V., Parnib
Holding N.V. and B.V. NIBC Mortgage Backed Assets. A complete list of the companies on behalf of
which NIBC has given guarantees within the meaning of Section 403 Title 9 of Book 2, of the

36 Subsequent events
Changes in Dutch fiscal unity regime as a result of Justice of the European Union
Judgement
On 22 February 2018, the Justice of the European Union decided that certain elements of the Dutch
fiscal unity regime for corporate income tax purposes violate the freedom of establishment and are
therefore contrary to European Union law. As a result, previously announced emergency legislation
will change the Dutch fiscal unity regime, with retroactive effect, from 25 October 2017. The wording
of this reparatory legislation is expected in the second quarter of 2018. This reparatory legislation
may have impact on group companies within the fiscal unity NIBC. Although the various Dutch rules
on restrictions of interest deductions will be applicable for group companies of a fiscal unity as from
25 October 2017, the impact for 2017 is immaterial. As soon as the final reparatory legislation is
available an impact analysis will be performed by NIBC. and to the extent possible measures will be
taken to mitigate potential negative effects.

•  The following statements for 2017: the company income statement, the company statements of comprehensive income 
and changes in shareholder’s equity 
•  The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information 
Basis for our opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our 
report. 
 
We are independent of NIBC Bank N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory 
audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening 
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a 
regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we 
have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 
 
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Explanation  Based on our professional judgment, a benchmark of 5% of operating profit before tax is an 
appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality and it best reflects the financial performance of 
NIBC. We have applied the initial planning materiality of EUR 12 million as set in our planning 
phase. Based on the actual operating income before tax as of 31 December 2017 we 
reassessed the materiality and concluded to apply the materiality initially set. 
 
We have also taken misstatements into account and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users 
of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. 
 
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 0.6 million which are identified during the audit, 
would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds. 
Scope of the group audit 
NIBC is the head of a group of entities and subsidiaries. The financial information of NIBC is included in the consolidated 
financial statements of NIBC. NIBC is structured in operating segments: Corporate client segment, Retail client segment and 
Treasury and group functions, focused on the Netherlands and Germany. NIBC also provides retail products in Belgium and 
has operations in the United Kingdom. 
 
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the 
group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group 
entities. Our group audit focused on the operating segments based on its size and risk, including one significant group entity 
in Germany. This resulted in a coverage of 98% of profit before taxes and 99% of total assets. 
 
This German component in scope for group reporting is audited by an EY member firm. We sent detailed instructions to the 
component auditor, covering significant areas including the relevant risks of material misstatement and set out the 
information required to be reported to the group audit team. We visited the component team in Germany, where we held 
physical meetings and/or calls with the auditor of this component and discussed the planning, risk assessment, procedures 
performed, findings and observations reported to the group auditor. 
 
The group audit team has set a component materiality level of EUR 1 million, based on the mix of size and financial 
statement risk profile of the component within the group to reduce the aggregation risk to an acceptable level. The 
consolidation of the group, the disclosures in the financial statements and certain accounting topics that are performed at 
group level are audited by the group audit team. The accounting matters on which audit procedures are performed by the 
group audit team include, but are not limited to, equity, group financing, certain elements of the loan loss provisioning 
process, corporate income tax for the Dutch fiscal unity and claims and litigations. 
 
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we 
have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an 
opinion about the financial statements. 
Our key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a 
comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. The key matters are similar to those reported following our 2016 audit, 
except for the recognition of deferred tax assets for carry forward losses. Furthermore, we now included our observations 
for the key audit matters. 
 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Valuation of corporate loans 
Key audit matter  Corporate loans are classified as loans and receivables and amount to EUR 7,749 million as at 31 December 
2017. These loans are measured at amortised cost, less a provision for loan losses (EUR 146 million). 
Certain aspects of the accounting for loan losses require significant judgment of management, such as the 
identification of loans that are deteriorating, the assessment of objective evidence for impairment, the value 
of collateral and the estimation of the recoverable amount. 
 
Due to the significance of corporate loans and the related estimation uncertainty, we consider the valuation 
of corporate loans as a key audit matter. Refer to the “Critical accounting estimates and judgments” section, 
note 15 “Loans (amortised cost)” and note 56 “Credit risk” to the financial statements. 
Our audit approach  Our audit approach included testing both the effectiveness of internal controls around determining loan loss 
provisions as well as substantive audit procedures. Our procedures over internal controls focused on 
controls around the accuracy of loan and collateral data, the determination of risk ratings and the process 
for identifying arrears and the management thereof. In our audit, we also considered the process around the 
internal validation and implementation of the models used to determine the loan loss provisions, as well as 
the periodic evaluation of the parameters applied in these models.  
 
We examined a selection of loan exposures that either continued to be, have  
become, or were at risk of being individually impaired. We applied professional judgement in selecting those 
exposures for our detailed inspection, placing an emphasis on portfolios that were potentially more sensitive 
to developing economic trends. For selected loan files, we challenged management’s estimate of the 
recoverable amount, including the cash generating capacity and, where applicable, the value of realisable 
collateral, based on available financial information, market information and, where applicable, the analysis of 
alternative recovery scenarios. Finally we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures and 
whether the disclosures are in compliance with the requirements included in EU-IFRS. 
Our observations  We have made recommendations to management relating to embedding observable impairment triggers in 
the risk/lending system, evidencing periodic review of repayment capacity and of back testing of leading 
scenarios for calculating individual provision in our 2017 management letter to NIBC’s management and the 
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Overall, we assess that the Corporate loans portfolio after 
deduction of loan loss provisions is fairly stated and concur with the related disclosures in the financial 
statements. 
Valuation residential mortgages at fair value through profit or loss 
 
Key audit matter  Residential mortgages designated at fair value through profit or loss (own book and securitized), amount to 
respectively EUR 4,581 and EUR 338 million. Due to the significance of the fair value through profit and loss 
mortgages and the related estimation  uncertainty in the determination of the retail spread and the 
prepayment rate, we determined the valuation to be a key audit matter. Refer to the accounting policies 
“financial instruments designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss”, the “critical 
accounting estimates and judgments”, note 5 “net trading income”, note 22 “residential mortgages own 
book (designated at fair value through profit and loss)”, note 23 “securitized residential mortgages 
(designated at fair value through profit or loss)” and note 44 “Fair value of financial instruments” to the 
financial statements. 
Our audit approach  Our audit approach included testing both the effectiveness of internal controls around fair value 
measurement as well as substantive audit procedures. 
Our procedures over internal controls focused on controls over valuation, independent price verification and 
model approval. We performed additional procedures for areas of higher risk and estimation with the 
assistance of our valuation experts. This included a challenge of pre-payment and retail spread assumptions 
made for the fair valuation of the residential mortgage portfolio and a re-performance of the valuation. 
Finally, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures and whether the disclosures are in 
compliance with the requirements included in EU-IFRS.

Our observations  We have made recommendations to management relating to evidencing the methodology and assumption 
setting process in our 2017 management letter to NIBC’s management and the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board. Overall, we assess that Residential mortgages designated at fair value through profit or 
loss are fairly stated and concur with the related disclosures in the financial statements. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets for carry forward losses 
 
Key audit matter  Deferred tax assets for carry forward losses (EUR 69 million) of EUR 17 million at 31 December 2017 have 
not been recognized because management considers future taxable profits not to be probable to that extent. 
Due to the significant judgment exercised when estimating future taxable income as well as the assumptions 
made in the allocation of future taxable income, we determined this management forecast to be a key audit 
matter. Refer to the “Critical accounting estimates and judgments” section and note 30 “Deferred tax” to the 
financial statements. 
Our audit approach  We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the data used for the estimations of future taxable income 
for the coming three years. We compared key inputs used by NIBC to forecast future taxable income to 
externally available data, to NIBC’s historical data and performance and assessed the sensitivity of the 
outcomes to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. We assessed with the assistance of our tax and 
valuation experts the key input variables used, including own credit spread adjustments and the expected 
impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2018 for internal forecasts for the coming three 
years. Finally, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures and whether the disclosures 
are in compliance with the requirements included in EU-IFRS. 
Our observations  We have made recommendations to management relating to evidencing the tax control framework in our 
2017 management letter to NIBC’s management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Overall, 
we assess that Deferred Tax Assets for carry forward losses are fairly stated and concur with the related 
disclosures in the financial statements. 
Reliability and continuity of the information technology and systems 
Key audit matter  NIBC is dependent on the IT infrastructure for the continuity and reliability of their business processes and 
financial reporting. NIBC continuously made investments to further improve the IT environment and IT 
systems. In particular, there was increased management attention on the planned outsourcing of various IT 
services to a third party and on the identified risks and information security requirements. We therefore 
consider this as a key audit matter. 
Audit approach  Our IT auditors assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment, insofar as needed within the 
scope of our audit of the 2017 financial statements. Amongst others, we tested the IT general controls 
related to logical access and change management and application controls embedded in NIBC’s key 
processes. Our work consisted of assessing the developments in the IT infrastructure and analysing the 
impact on the IT organization. In addition, we assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment 
and the impact of changes during the year either from the ongoing transitioning initiative toward a platform 
sourced by an external party or from external factors such as reporting requirements.  
Our observations  We have made recommendations to management relating to internal controls and governance of outsourced 
applications in our 2017 management letter to NIBC’s management and the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board. Overall, the combination of the tests of the controls and the substantive tests performed, 
provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on the continued operation of the IT systems for the 
purposes of our audit.

Description of responsibilities for the financial statements 
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS 
and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the 
financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and

circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial 
statements.  
 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. 
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
audit evidence for our opinion.  
 
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all 
material errors and fraud. 
 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The 
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified 
misstatements on our opinion.  
 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance 
with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.: 
•  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control 
•  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
company’s internal control 
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management 
•  Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going 
concern 
•  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures 
•  Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation 
 
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the 
group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group 
entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group 
entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. 
 
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this 
respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on 
specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is 
consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.

We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in 
the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
NIBC uses, throughout its financial publications, alternative performance measures (APMs) in addition
to the figures that are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). NIBC
uses APMs to provide additional information to investors and to enhance the understanding of the
results. The APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, the figures
determined according to IFRS, CRR and CRD IV. All measures that are covered by IFRS, CRR and
CRD IV are not considered to be APMs.
NIBC uses the following APMs:
■ Dividend payout ratio, %
■ Cost/income ratio, %
■ Return on equity, %
■ Cost of risk, %
■ Impairment ratio, %
■ NPL ratio, %
■ Impairment coverage ratio, %
■ Loan-to-deposit ratio, %
■ Net interest margin, %
Investors should consider that similarly titled APMs reported by other companies may be calculated
differently. For that reason, the comparability of APMs across companies might be limited. In
accordance with the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the
following information is given in regards to the above mentioned alternative performance measures:
1. Definition of the APM;
2. Reconciliation of the APM to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total presented in
the financial statements.
NIBC’s most recent financial publications at any time are available online at our website.
Dividend payout ratio
The dividend payout ratio is the fraction of net income for a period to be paid to NIBC’s
shareholders in dividends. It provides meaningful information on the portion of NIBC’s profit that is
distributed to its shareholders. The elements of the dividend payout ratio reconcile to the income
statement of NIBC.

Return on equity
Return on equity measures net profit in relation to the book value of shareholder’s equity. It provides
meaningful information on the performance of Issuer’s business, as well as on NIBC’s ability to
generate income from the equity available to it. Return on equity is calculated as the ratio of (i)
annualised net profit attributable to parent shareholder to (ii) total shareholder's equity at the start of
the financial year. All elements of the return on equity reconcile to NIBC’s consolidated financial
statement.

Cost of risk
The cost of risk compares the total credit losses included in the income statement to the total risk
weighted assets. This measure provides meaningful information on Issuer’s performance in managing
credit losses. The cost of risk is calculated as the ratio of (i) the sum of annualised impairments and
the credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans (as part of the net trading income) and
to (ii) the total risk weighted assets averaged over the reporting period. With the exception of the
credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans, the elements of the cost of risk reconcile to
our financial statements and regulatory reporting. The credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans
are calculated in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and form part of the
net trading income.

NPL ratio
The non-performing loans (NPL) ratio compares the non-performing exposure (as defined by the
European Banking Authority) of corporate and retail loans to the total exposure of these loans. The
measure provides meaningful information on the credit quality of NIBC’s assets. The ratio is calculated
by dividing the total of non-performing exposure for both corporate loans and mortgage loans by the
total exposure for corporate loans and mortgage loans. The elements of the NPL ratio reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements and the regulatory reporting of NIBC.

Net interest margin
The net interest margin is a measure to display the difference between interest income and the
amount of interest paid out to lenders, relative to the amount of interest-earning assets. It is similar to
the gross margin (or gross profit margin) of non-financial companies and provides meaningful
information on the contribution of Issuer’s business to its operating income. It is calculated as the
ratio of (i) the net interest income from the last 12 months and (ii) the 12 months moving average
interest bearing assets. Interest bearing assets equal the total assets from the consolidated balance
sheet excluding equity investments, derivatives, investments in associates, property, plant and
equipment and other assets. The net interest income reconciles to the income statement of NIBC.
332 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
OTHER INFORMATION
The average interest bearing assets cannot be directly reconciled with the financial publications of
NIBC as the monthly figures are not disclosed, however the monthly figures are prepared in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
Since the denominator of the net interest margin calculation is subject to volatility in the balance, a
moving average provides more reliable information on the underlying developments. The moving
average however does not tie back to disclosed balances. For reference purposes, the following table
shows the calculation method and the comparative outcome for 2017 when the net interest margin
is calculated on ending balances instead of moving averages.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING SCOPE
This Annual Report is an integrated report. We have chosen to combine all our financial, economic,
social and environmental information into one document because all these factors are integral to
NIBC’s strategy and operations. By providing this additional information we aim to increase
transparency for all of our stakeholders and to allow them to make a more informed assessment of
NIBC and how we are creating and sustaining value.
The non-financial key figures for this report were confirmed by the departments that are responsible
for the data. The reported non-financial key figures were reviewed by Internal Audit. Internal Audit
confirmed that nothing has come to the attention that causes them to believe that the reported non-
financial key figures for NIBC Bank N.V. are inadequately presented, in all material respects, in
accordance with the reporting criteria.
Scope
Unless specified otherwise, this report includes figures and information for NIBC Holding N.V.
(including all international offices and wholly-owned subsidiaries established by NIBC for our business
purposes).
NIBC Bank N.V. is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. The NIBC Bank N.V. Annual Report
contains details of our progress as regards the 10 Global Compact principles.
Criteria
The contents of this Annual Report and the selection of non-financial key figures are based on the
following criteria:
■ Assessment of materiality. We report on NIBC’s strategy and the elements that we have identified
as most relevant for us as a company and for our stakeholders. Please see our Materiality
Assessment report and materiality matrix for an overview of these elements;
■ Legal and regulatory requirements. For NIBC, the principal regulatory requirements are contained
in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Banking Code and the Dutch Decree on
disclosure of non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiële informatie), which
came into effect on 24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330). Please see the Corporate Governance
sector for more details.
Accountability and reporting standards
Our non-financial key figures are prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria and guidelines of
the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. We have applied the GRI Standards guidelines at
a 'core' level with no exceptions. The GRI content index and glossary of definitions can be found in
the appendices available on our website.
The methodology used for the calculation of indicators for 2017 is the same as for 2016 unless
otherwise stated in the definitions for non-financial key figures. 
Materiality Assessment
We engaged with our stakeholders to verify the focus of our sustainability strategy and materiality in
reporting. This materiality assessment process and the outcomes are described here and form the
basis for our Annual Report.
334 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
OTHER INFORMATION
Stakeholder consultation confirmed the three most important aspects for stakeholders were client
satisfaction, product responsibility, and stakeholder engagement. Given their importance to
stakeholders, NIBC will focus on in these areas while continuing to prioritize our efforts across the
other aspects which stakeholders found to be most material.

Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 335
OTHER INFORMATION
DEFINITIONS FOR THE NON-FINANCIAL KEY FIGURES
The following definitions have been used for the Non Financial Key Figures presented in NIBC’s
annual report.
NPS
Outcome of Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey with corporate lending clients, who executed a lending
deal/deals with NIBC Corporate Banking during the reporting period, and for existing lending clients
of NIBC.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our corporate lending clients as
well as an indicator of stakeholder engagement.
The NPS methodology is a widely used methodology in which scores from 0 to 6 are classified as
'detractor', scores. 7 or 8 are classified as 'passive' and only those scores that are 9 or 10 are
classified as 'promoters'. The result is calculated by the percentage of promoters minus the
percentage of detractors, giving the NPS. The NPS can therefore range from -100% to +100%.
The NPS is measured over a 12 month period, from the 1st December to the 30st November each
year. It takes place in four batches and each respondent weighs the same in the score. It is calculated
over the corporate lending client base, where we are in direct contact with the client, excluding
distressed asset clients, internal clients and certain legacy clients. In case of multiple deals for one
client, the client is counted once. When the online survey is sent to multiple contact persons for a
client, only the first response is included.
The total population of NIBC corporate clients in scope is 602 clients in the 12 month period. 409
clients fall within the definition described above and were surveyed, 165 responses were received.
NIBC considers this to be representative of the total population. The online surveys are sent by a
third party service provider, which transfers the raw results back to NIBC.
NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction Score
The results of the latest, annual online Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) for the bank's retail clients,
i.e. NIBC Direct Savings Netherlands (NL, including Mortgages), Belgium (BE) and Germany(GE, also
including Brokerage clients), that was completed in the reporting period.
The digital surveys were conducted in October through third parties, using a random selection of
NIBC’s new and existing Dutch mortgages- and NIBC Direct Savings clients, Belgian NIBC Direct
Savings clients and German brokerage- and NIBC Direct Savings clients. Clients were selected based
on country, product, and duration of services. The average scores per country and product are
totaled and divided by the total number of respondents.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our retail clients as well as an
indicator of stakeholder engagement.
The total population of NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction survey was 400.000 clients in October
2017, of which 30.000 have been surveyed, and 3.039 responses were received. NIBC considers this
to be representative of the total population.
336 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017
OTHER INFORMATION
% of new Corporate loans screened against sustainability policy framework
New corporate deals which have been assessed for social and environmental risks during the
reporting period. A deal may include one or more underlying facilities with different tenors as part of
a deal or loan structure. Amendments to existing deals are excluded from this figure.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator in regard to transparency. Sustainability impacts and
good corporate governance are among the financial and non-financial aspects taken into
consideration during NIBC’s corporate client engagement and financing decision processes.
Screenings were performed by Corporate Banking account managers as part of NIBC’s ongoing and
mandatory due diligence process using a third party toolkit system.
Number of New clients/transactions with increased sustainability risk assessment
Number of new (potential) clients/transactions for which increased sustainability risks were identified
using a third party toolkit assessment. This does not include monitoring of existing client files with
sustainability risks nor clients for which a sustainability risk assessment has not (yet) been completed
as the transaction is still in an early stage or was cancelled in an early stage.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of stakeholder engagement on potential sustainability
issues.
In these situations, NIBC performs enhanced sustainability due diligence into potential material
environmental, social, and governance aspects that are of potential concern.
Fines or sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations
Number of significant fines and number of non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and
regulations. The definition is limited to fines from a regulator. This excludes any pending claims and/or
litigation. Significant: values of fine > EUR 10.000 (in line with category 2 and 3 fines of AFM).
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of regulatory compliance and corporate governance of
NIBC’s own operations and day-to-day business.
NIBC includes non-punitive fines agreed as part of settlement of regular tax audits within its
interpretation of the definition for this indicator.
Number of FTE's end of year
Number of FTE's of NIBC worldwide at the end of the year. Only employees on NIBC's payroll and
having an 'internal' position are accounted for. NIBC Bank N.V. includes all its international offices as
well as NIBC Bank Deutschland AG, though excludes minor participations of the bank.
At year end 2017, 666 FTEs have been reported, a year-on-year decrease of 38 FTEs.
A Full Time Equivalent (FTE) represents, per employee, the total number of contract hours per week
related to the maximum number of contract hours per week (e.g. 40 hours). This maximum can
differ per NIBC office (depending on local guidelines) and kind of job contract.
Male/female ratio
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2017 337
OTHER INFORMATION
The number of males and females is based upon headcount as reported from NIBC's human
resources information management system at the end of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity in the company. NIBC
supports all types of diversity and aspires to further diversify its workplace.
Male/female ratio top management
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year. Top
management consists of management with corporate title 'Director' and 'Managing Director'.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity of top management.
Training expenses per employee
Total of training and education expenses, incurred in the current year based on average headcount
calculated by taking the headcount at the beginning and end of the year. For employees traveling for
training, this includes travel costs and any related expenses.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of the bank’s commitment to employee
development and future employability.
Absenteeism
Absenteeism is the rolling average of the latest absenteeism percentage, annualized for NIBC’s
employees in The Netherlands. The absenteeism percentage is the number of workdays lost to
absenteeism divided by the total number of available workdays, expressed as a percentage. In case of
partial absenteeism, the absenteeism percentage only reflects the actual absenteeism (non-working
hours). Maternity leave is not included in the figure.
Absenteeism rate may change as the year progresses due to previously unreported cases of
absenteeism and/or confirmation of the employee’s recovery.
Notifications of illness and recovery are submitted by NIBC to a 3rd party ARBO service
organization. NIBC uses its 3rd party health & safety services organization to report on absenteeism
figures. The absenteeism percentage relates to the absenteeism in the Netherlands only: absenteeism
in Germany, Belgium and United Kingdom is not accounted for in this figure.
Employee turnover (employees started & left)
Employee turnover consists of inflow of new employees ('started') and outflow of existing employees
('left').
Started: The number of employees that joined NIBC worldwide throughout the current calendar
year (hire date between 1-1-17 and 31-12-17), divided by total number of employees at the end of
the year.
Left: The number of employees that left NIBC worldwide throughout the calendar year divided by
the total number of employees at the end of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of employee engagement of existing employees
and further as an indicator of the bank’s position as an attractive employer.
