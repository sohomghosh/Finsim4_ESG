1. Serviced Offices are offices and co-located data centers for which landlords have full operational control. 
2. BlackRock’s support for this initiative is made via grants recommended to and paid by the BlackRock Charitable Trust, a donor-advised fund.
3. In  June 2020, we achieved our 100% renewable energy goal to match the same amount of renewable electricity as the electricity that our global  operations 
(including data centers) consume annually through  procuring renewable energy directly where possible and through purchasing environmental attribute 
credits where we do not have operational control or renewable energy is not available. We contract directly for renewable  energy wherever possible 
(approximately 50%) and where we do not have operational control to procure our own energy, we purchase environmental  attributecredits as a means of 
achieving our 100% renewable goal.
4. Our data centers consume 75% less energy than the typical enterprise data center does for cooling and electrical support. Ourenterprise data centers operate 
at a PUE of 1.1 and 1.2; the industry average data center PUE is 1.8.
