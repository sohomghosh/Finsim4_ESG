In 2012, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) formed a working group, the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF), that was mandated to develop principles for 
enhancing the risk disclosures of major banks, to recommend improvements to current risk disclosures, and to identify risk disclosure best practices used by 
major financial institutions. The EDTF published a report entitled Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks, which contains 32 recommendations. The Bank makes 
every effort to ensure overall compliance with those recommendations and is continuing to enhance its risk disclosures to meet the best practices on an ongoing 
basis. The risk disclosures required by the EDTF are provided in this Annual Report and in the document entitled Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3

Management’s Discussion 
and Analysis 
DDeecceemmbbeerr  33,,  22001199  
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) presents the financial condition and operating results of National Bank of Canada (the Bank). This 
analysis was prepared in accordance with the requirements set out in National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations, released by the Canadian 
Securities Administrators (CSA). It is based on the audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2019 (the consolidated 
financial statements) and prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB), unless otherwise indicated. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This MD&A should be read in conjunction 
with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended October 31, 2019. All amounts are presented in Canadian dollars. 
Additional information about the Bank, including the Annual Information Form, can be obtained from the Bank’s website at nbc.ca and  SEDAR’s website at

From time to time, the Bank makes written and oral forward-looking statements, such as those contained in the Economic Review and Outlook section of this Annual Report, in other 
filings with Canadian securities regulators, and in other communications, for the purpose of describing the economic environment in which the Bank will operate during fiscal 2020 
and the objectives it hopes to achieve for that period. These forward-looking statements are made in accordance with current securities legislation in Canada and the United States. 
They include, among others, statements with respect to the economy—particularly the Canadian and U.S. economies—market changes, observations regarding the Bank’s objectives 
and its strategies for achieving them, Bank-projected financial returns and certain risks faced by the Bank. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by future or 
conditional verbs or words such as “outlook,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar terms and expressions. 
By their very nature, such forward-looking statements require assumptions to be made and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific. Assumptions about the 
performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2020 and how that will affect the Bank’s business are among the main factors considered in setting the Bank’s strategic priorities 
and objectives and in determining its financial targets, including provisions for credit losses. In determining its expectations for economic growth, both broadly and in the financial 
services sector in particular, the Bank primarily considers historical economic data provided by the Canadian and U.S. governments and their agencies. 
There is a strong possibility that express or implied projections contained in these forward-looking statements will not materialize or will not be accurate. The Bank recommends that 
readers not place undue reliance on these statements, as a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control, could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or 
events to differ significantly from the targets, expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include credit risk, market risk, liquidity 
and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk and environmental risk, all of which are described in more detail in the Risk Management 
section beginning on page 58 of this Annual Report, and more specifically, general economic environment and financial market conditions in Canada, the United States and certain 
other countries in which the Bank conducts business, including regulatory changes affecting the Bank’s business; changes in the accounting policies the Bank uses to report its 
financial condition, including uncertainties associated with assumptions and critical accounting estimates; tax laws in the countries in which the Bank operates, primarily Canada and 
the United States (including the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)); changes to capital and liquidity guidelines and to the manner in which they are to be presented and 
interpreted; changes to the credit ratings assigned to the Bank; and potential disruptions to the Bank’s information technology systems, including evolving cyberattack risk. 
The foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these factors can be found in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report. Investors and others 
who rely on the Bank’s forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Except as required 
by law, the Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, by it or on its behalf. 
The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of interpreting the information contained herein and may not be appropriate for other 
purposes. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg  MMeetthhoodd  
As stated in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank adopted IFRS 15 on November 1, 2018. As permitted by IFRS 15, the Bank did not restate 
comparative consolidated financial statements, and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements presents the impact of IFRS 15 adoption on the Bank’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2018.  
The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the year beginning November 1, 2018. This presentation 
reflects the fact that advisor banking service activities, which had previously been presented in the Wealth Management segment, are now presented in the 
Personal and Commercial segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its activities with its management structure. 
NNoonn--GGAAAAPP  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess    
The Bank uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring its overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not 
calculated in accordance with GAAP, which are based on IFRS. Presenting non-GAAP financial measures helps readers to better understand how management 
analyzes results, shows the impacts of specified items on the results of the reported periods, and allows readers to assess results without the specified items 
if they consider such items not to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Bank’s operations. Securities regulators require companies to caution 
readers that non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other 
companies. 
Like many other financial institutions, the Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate net interest income, non-interest income and income taxes. This 
calculation method consists of grossing up certain tax-exempt income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. An 
equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform a uniform comparison of the return on different assets regardless 
of their tax treatment.  
The specified items related to the acquisitions of recent years (mainly those of the Wealth Management segment) are no longer presented as specified items as 
of November 1, 2018, since the amounts are not considered significant. The figures for the year ended October 31, 2018 reflect this change.

The Bank’s financial information is prepared with the support of a set of disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) that are implemented by the President and 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and by the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance (CFO). During the year ended October 31, 2019, in 
accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (Regulation 52-109), released by the CSA, the 
design and operation of these controls and procedures were evaluated to determine their effectiveness. 
As at October 31, 2019, the CEO and the CFO confirmed the effectiveness of the DC&P. These controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the 
information disclosed in annual and interim filings and in other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and 
reported within the time periods specified by that legislation. These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated 
and communicated to the Bank’s management, including its signing officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.  
This Annual Report was reviewed by the Disclosure Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Bank’s Board of Directors (the Board), which approved it prior to 
publication.

The internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and that 
the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which are based on IFRS, unless indicated otherwise as explained on pages 14 
and 15 of this MD&A. Due to inherent limitations, the ICFR may not prevent or detect all misstatements in a timely manner. 
The CEO and the CFO oversaw the evaluation work performed on the design and operation of the Bank’s ICFR in accordance with Regulation 52-109. These 
controls were evaluated in accordance with the control framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO — 2013) 
for financial controls and in accordance with the control framework of the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) for general 
information technology controls.  
Based on the evaluation results, the CEO and CFO concluded, as at October 31, 2019, that there are no material weaknesses, that the ICFR are effective and 
provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is reliable, and that the Bank’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with 
GAAP.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
Overview
For fiscal 2019, the Bank declared $892 million in dividends to common shareholders (2018:  Year ended October 31 
$829 million), representing 42% of net income attributable to common shareholders (2018: 41%).  (Canadian dollars) 
As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios were, respectively, 11.7%, 
15.0% and 16.1%, i.e., above the regulatory requirements, compared to ratios of, respectively, 
11.7%, 15.5% and 16.8% as at October 31, 2018. The CET1 capital ratio remained stable. Net income 
net of dividends, and common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan offset the application of 
2015 2016  2017  2018 
the Standardized Approach for measuring Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) rules for measuring 
counterparty credit risk, growth in risk-weighted assets, the common share repurchases during the 
year ended October 31, 2019, and remeasurements of pension plans and other post-employment 
benefit plans. The decreases in the Tier 1 capital ratio and the Total capital ratio were essentially due 
to growth in risk-weighted assets. As at October 31, 2019, the leverage ratio was 4.0%, stable  As at October 31 
compared to October 31, 2018. The growth in Tier 1 capital was offset by growth in total leverage

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
Overview 
EEccoonnoommiicc  RReevviieeww  aanndd  OOuuttllooookk
GGlloobbaall  EEccoonnoommyy  
While talks between China and the Unites States in the trade war opposing the two countries seem to be making headway, the damage to the global economy 
has already been considerable. Worldwide, the manufacturing sector has been contracting for the past six months, but the services sector has kept the economy 
afloat. Washington, like Beijing, stands to benefit from a truce. The trade war has hurt the Middle Kingdom, where slower growth is in large part due to a downturn 
not only in exports but also in investment. To address the situation, Chinese authorities have had to implement stimulus measures via monetary and budgetary 
policy in order to achieve their growth target of 6-6.5%. Owing to its relatively intense participation in the global value chain, the eurozone has been hardest hit 
by the turmoil of the trade war. Germany, for instance, may already be in the midst of a technical recession after its economy contracted again in the second 
quarter. Given the growing uncertainty, a majority of central banks have opted to ease their monetary policy in the third quarter, a record high since the global 
recession of 2008-2009. This should be enough for the global economy to keep expanding. We expect global economic growth to reach 3.2% in 2020(1), up 
slightly from 2019 (3.0%)(1). 
In the U.S., the longest growth streak in history is showing signs of losing steam, thus reviving fears of recession in the present context of strained international 
trade relations. In our opinion, the probability of a recession in the next twelve months does not exceed 30%, as a truce remains the most likely scenario in light 
of the coming U.S. presidential election. Moreover, the resilience of consumption and of the labour market is largely compensating for the weakness in foreign 
trade, which is putting the brakes on business investment. By lowering interest rates in October after twice doing so this summer, the U.S. Federal Reserve has 
contributed to setting the yield curve back on an upward slope after its inversion in 2019 had raised alarm bells. We believe that this rate adjustment will suffice 
for now. With the 2020 election in the offing, we can expect both monetary and budgetary policy to remain accommodative. We expect U.S. GDP to grow 2.3% 
and 1.9% in 2019 and 2020(1), respectively. 
CCaannaaddiiaann  EEccoonnoommyy  
The Canadian economy has once again proven the skeptics wrong after weakness in the energy and real estate sectors early in the year was seen as a bad omen. 
As it happens, the economy bounced back spectacularly in the second quarter, growing at an annualized rate of 3.7%. Job creation in the first ten months of the 
year has been the strongest ever since 2002 and wage growth has picked up relentlessly. The vitality of the labour market and lower interest rates have energized 
the housing market, which has managed to rebound in both Ontario and British Columbia. There is no denying that household debt levels are high and the 
savings rate very low at present. This should translate into moderate consumption growth. However, other sectors should step up in 2020 and push the economy 
to grow near potential (1.6%)(1). Canadian exports should benefit from persistently strong U.S. demand and a weak currency. Furthermore, given the federal 
election results, a fiscal stimulus is in the cards for 2020. Given the economy’s resilience and an annual core inflation rate essentially on target, the Bank of 
Canada should not have to follow the Fed’s lead in easing monetary policy, unless hostilities flare up again between China and the United States. 
QQuueebbeecc  EEccoonnoommyy  
The Quebec economy continues to forge ahead at a sustained pace. GDP has grown for ten months in a row, the longest such streak since statistics began to be 
calculated in 1997. The economy and the labour market are being spurred on by an accommodative monetary policy and budgetary stimulus. Over 87,000 net 
new jobs have been created in the province since the beginning of 2019, the best showing in this regard since 2012. The unemployment rate could hit a record 
low for a fourth straight year in 2019. Labour shortages are no doubt having an impact on the hourly wages of permanent employees, which in the past year have 
registered their steepest increase by far since 1998 (6.1% in 2019 third quarter). In this context, the real estate market, which remains more affordable in Quebec 
than elsewhere in Canada, is headed for a record year in terms of home sales. Economic growth is expected to slow down but should remain solid at 1.5% in 
2020 (2.5% in 2019)(1). The household savings rate is high and household debt is lower than in the rest of the country, which bodes well for consumption in the 
coming quarters.

AAnnaallyyssiiss  ooff  CCoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  RReessuullttss  
FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReessuullttss  
For fiscal 2019, the Bank’s net income totalled $2,322 million compared to $2,232 million in fiscal 2018, a year-over-year increase owing essentially to net 
income growth across most of the business segments, tempered by a slowdown in the Financial Markets segment during the first six months of fiscal 2019. 
Specified items, net of income taxes, had a $6 million unfavourable impact on net income in fiscal 2019. The fiscal 2019 specified items, net of income taxes, 
include a $68 million gain on disposal of Fiera Capital shares, a $43 million gain on disposal of premises and equipment, a $27 million loss on the remeasurement 
at fair value of the Bank’s investment in NSIA, $42 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $33 million in provisions 
for onerous contracts, an $8 million charge related to Maple, and $7 million in severance pay. For fiscal 2019, the Bank’s net income excluding specified items(1) 
totalled $2,328 million, up 4% from $2,232 million in fiscal 2018. 
TToottaall  RReevveennuueess  
For fiscal 2019, the Bank’s total revenues amounted to $7,432 million, up $266 million or 4% from $7,166 million in fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2019 total revenues 
include a $79 million gain on disposal of Fiera Capital shares, a $50 million gain on disposal of premises and equipment, and a $33 million loss arising from the 
remeasurement at fair value of the Bank’s investment in NSIA. The increase in total revenues was driven by revenue growth across all of the Bank’s business 
segments. The 2019 total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items(1) were up $255 million or 3% year over year. For additional 
information about total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis(1), see Table 2 on page 104.  
Net Interest Income 
For fiscal 2019, the Bank’s net interest income totalled $3,596 million, rising $214 million from $3,382 million in fiscal 2018. The 2019 net interest income on 
a taxable equivalent basis(1) was $3,791 million compared to $3,526 million in fiscal 2018 (Table 3, page 104).  
In the Personal and Commercial (P&C) segment, the fiscal 2019 net interest income totalled $2,383 million, a $107 million or 5% year-over-year increase driven 
mainly by growth in loan volumes (primarily from mortgage and commercial lending activity) and in deposit volumes, which rose 5% and 7%, respectively. This 
increase in P&C’s net interest income was tempered by a narrowing of the net interest margin, which was 2.23% in fiscal 2019 versus 2.24% in fiscal 2018, that 
was largely due to a decrease in loan margins. In the Wealth Management segment, the fiscal 2019 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis(1) totalled 
$470 million, a $24 million year-over-year increase owing to growth in loan and deposit volumes. 
As for the Financial Markets segment, its 2019 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis(1) was up $65 million or 16% year over year, mainly due to 
trading activities, and should be examined together with the other items of trading activity revenues. In the USSF&I segment, the fiscal 2019 net interest income 
was up $72 million year over year owing to growth in loan and deposit volumes at the Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank) subsidiary, tempered by a 
decrease in net interest income at the Credigy subsidiary. 
Non-Interest Income 
For fiscal 2019, non-interest income totalled $3,836 million versus $3,784 million in fiscal 2018. The 2019 non-interest income includes a $79 million gain on 
disposal of Fiera Capital shares, a $50 million gain on disposal of premises and equipment, and a $33 million loss arising from the remeasurement at fair value 
of the Bank’s investment in NSIA. Non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items(1) amounted to $3,875 million in fiscal 2019 
compared to $3,885 million in fiscal 2018. For additional information on non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis(1), see Table 4 on page 105.  
The fiscal 2019 revenues from underwriting and advisory fees were down 19% when compared to fiscal 2018, in particular due to merger and acquisition 
activities in the Financial Markets segment. Revenues from securities brokerage commissions were also down, declining $17 million as a result of lower 
transaction volume during fiscal 2019. Together, mutual fund revenues and trust service revenues totalled $1,058 million in fiscal 2019, a $33 million year-over-
year increase resulting from growth in fee-based revenues and from an increase in assets under administration and under management arising from stronger 
stock market performance in 2019. 
The trading revenues recorded in non-interest income amounted to $829 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $840 million in fiscal 2018. Trading revenues on a 
taxable equivalent basis(1) recorded in non-interest income totalled $964 million, an increase from $941 million in 2018. Including the portion recorded in net 
interest income, trading activity revenues on a taxable equivalent basis(1) amounted to $1,199 million in 2019, a $50 million year-over-year increase (Table 5, 
page 105) attributable to revenues from equity securities and from fixed-income securities, whereas revenues from commodities and foreign exchange activities 
and revenues from other segments decreased year over year.

Financial Analysis 
In fiscal 2019, revenues from credit fees and revenues from acceptances and letters of credit and guarantee were up $14 million year over year, as there was 
increased credit activity in Commercial Banking, the Financial Markets segment, and the Credigy subsidiary. Card revenues posted 10% year-over-year growth 
during fiscal 2019, whereas revenues from deposit and payment service charges were down $9 million given a revision to rates. The Bank’s fiscal 2019 insurance 
revenues were up $15 million year over year, partly due to a revision to actuarial reserves. As for other-than-trading foreign exchange revenues and gains on 
non-trading securities, they remained stable when compared to fiscal 2018. The Bank’s share in the net income of associates and joint ventures was also up, 
rising $6 million year over year. Other revenues amounted to $251 million in fiscal 2019, a $78 million year-over-year increase owing mainly to the 2019 specified 
items, which include a gain on disposal of Fiera Capital shares and a gain on disposal of premises and equipment, tempered by a loss arising from a fair value 
remeasurement of the Bank’s investment in NSIA.

Non-interest expenses stood at $4,301 million in fiscal 2019, up $238 million from fiscal 2018 (Table 6, page 106). The 2019 non-interest expenses include 
$57 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $45 million in provisions for onerous contracts, an $11 million charge 
related to Maple, and $10 million in severance pay. Non-interest expenses excluding specified items(1) stood at $4,178 million, up $115 million or 3% year over 
year. 
Compensation and employee benefits stood at $2,532 million in fiscal 2019, a 3% year-over-year increase resulting from an increase in the number of employees, 
which essentially stems from the expansion of ABA Bank’s banking network, and an annual increase in salaries, tempered somewhat by a lower pension expense. 
Occupancy expenses were also up, rising year over year due to provisions for onerous contracts recorded during the year in addition to business growth at ABA 
Bank. The increase in technology expenses, including amortization, came from the technology investments made to execute the Bank’s transformation plan and 
for business development activities, in addition to impairment losses on premises and equipment and intangible assets recorded in fiscal 2019. Other expenses 
were also up, mainly due to expenses related to the activities of the Financial Markets segment and to the charge related to Maple.

For fiscal 2019, the Bank recorded $347 million in provisions for credit losses, $20 million more than the provisions recorded in fiscal 2018 (Table 7, page 107). 
This increase came mainly from higher credit loss provisions on credit card receivables, which rose $7 million year over year, and from higher credit loss 
provisions on loans in the Financial Markets segment, which rose $26 million year over year. These higher provisions relate mainly to provisions on impaired 
loans. In the USSF&I segment, provisions for credit losses on loans were down $14 million, essentially attributable to the Credigy subsidiary. At $313 million, 
the fiscal 2019 provisions for credit losses on impaired loans represent 0.21% of average loans and acceptances, less than last year’s 0.23%, notably due to a 
decrease in the credit losses on impaired loans of the Credigy subsidiary, tempered by an increase in credit losses on impaired loans in the Financial Markets 
segment.

Detailed information about the Bank’s income taxes is provided in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal 2019, income taxes stood at 
$462 million, representing an effective tax rate of 17% compared to $544 million and an effective tax rate of 20% in 2018. This change in effective tax rate was 
created mainly by a realization of capital gains taxed at a lower rate, by higher income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, and by a year-over-year increase in the 
2019 tax-exempt dividend income.

The Bank carries out its activities in four business segments, which are defined below. For presentation purposes, other activities are grouped in the Other 
heading. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele and marketing strategy. 
The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the year beginning November 1, 2018. This presentation 
reflects the fact that advisor banking service activities, which had previously been presented in the Wealth Management segment, are now presented in the 
Personal and Commercial segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its activities with its management structure.

The economic environment is resilient in Quebec and in the rest of the country, driven by accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus. Consumers are 
benefitting from strong employment gains and accelerating wages. The unemployment rate is on track to hit a record low for a fourth straight year in 2019 in 
Quebec. Wages are rising at the fastest pace among provinces, and the savings rate stands at a multi-year high, providing a cushion that can support 
consumption. Furthermore, both consumer and business confidence are high in Quebec. The province’s household debt level is below the Canadian average, 
and housing affordability is better. Business investment is being supported by accelerated depreciation measures implemented by the federal and some 
provincial governments. The financial sector is quickly transforming toward digital and mobile services, and there is vigorous competition between established 
entities and new market participants that are distinguishing themselves through new technologies.  
The economic environment in 2019 and the outlook for 2020 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 20.

from $952 million in fiscal 2018. The segment’s total revenues rose $143 million or 4% year over 
year, primarily owing to growth in net interest income, which was up $107 million, as well as to a $36 
million increase in non-interest income. The growth in net interest income was driven mostly by higher 
personal and commercial loan and deposit volumes but was tempered by a narrowing of the net

mainly from loan margins.  37%

The segment’s non-interest expenses stood at $1,816 million in fiscal 2019, a 2% year-over-year

Policymakers acted pre-emptively as a fear of the global economy sliding into a recession increased as a result of the trade conflict between the United States 
and China. The U.S. Federal Reserve applied a rate-cut, realizing a 75-basis point decline in its policy rate. Given the resilience of the Canadian economy and 
inflation, the Bank of Canada did not deem stimulus as necessary as the Canadian economy is benefitting from lower long-term rates and improving global 
financial conditions. Those welcomed developments, combined with resilience in the labour market and housing market, suggest steady growth in the coming 
quarters. 
The economic environment in 2019 and the outlook for 2020 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 20.

In the Wealth Management segment, net income totalled $499 million in fiscal 2019, up $35 million  (on a taxable equivalent basis)(1) 
or 8% from $464 million in fiscal 2018. The segment’s total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis(1) 
amounted to $1,743 million in fiscal 2019, up $54 million from $1,689 million in fiscal 2018. This 
increase stems mainly from a 5% increase in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis(1) 
owing to growth in the segment’s loan and deposit volumes. The fiscal 2019 fee-based revenues were  15% 
up 3% year over year given growth in assets under administration and under management generated  27% 
by net inflows into various solutions and due to stronger stock market performance in fiscal 2019. As 
for the transaction-based and other revenues category, it remained stable when compared to fiscal 
2018. 
The segment’s non-interest expenses stood at $1,067 million in fiscal 2019, a $9 million year-over-
year increase attributable mainly to higher compensation and employee benefits as well as to higher 
operations support charges related to the segment's initiatives. The 2019 efficiency ratio on a taxable  58%

The Financial Markets segment operates two main business lines: Global Markets and Corporate and Investment Banking.

Financial Markets is a Canadian leader in risk management solutions and structured products and is the largest market-maker in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
in Canada by volume. The segment offers solutions covering fixed income securities, currencies, equities and commodities in order to mitigate the financial and 
business risks of clients. It also provides new product development expertise to asset managers and fund companies and supports their success by providing 
liquidity, research, and counterparty services. Financial Markets also provides tailored investment products across all asset classes to institutional and retail 
distribution channels.

Financial Markets provides services in corporate banking, advisory and capital markets. It offers loan origination and syndication to corporations for project 
financing, merger and acquisition transactions, and corporate financing solutions. The segment is also an investment banking leader in Quebec and across 
Canada. Its comprehensive services include strategic advisory for financing and mergers and acquisitions as well as for debt and equity underwriting. It is the 
Canadian leader in government and corporate high-yield debt underwriting. Dominant in Quebec, it leads deals for provincial and municipal governments across 
Canada while growing its national position in infrastructure and project financing. Financial Markets is active in securitization financing, mainly Government-of-
Canada-insured mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.

In 2019, global uncertainties dominated financial headlines. Trade negotiations between the United States and China oscillated between detente and escalation 
before taking a turn for the better at the end of October with the announcement of significant progress for a truce between the two countries. Given the growing 
uncertainty and the slowing global economy, a majority of central banks have opted to ease their monetary policy in the third quarter, a record high since the 
global recession of 2008-2009. The Bank of Canada did not deem it necessary to add stimulus as labour market strength contributed to a housing market 
rebound. Steady growth is expected in the coming quarters, as financial conditions have improved and some fiscal stimulus is expected next year. 
The economic environment in 2019 and the outlook for 2020 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 20.

Year ended October 31, 2019 
In the Financial Markets segment, net income totalled $717 million in fiscal 2019, down 6% year over  (taxable equivalent basis)(1) 
year. The segment’s fiscal 2019 total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis(1) amounted to $1,750 
million, up $7 million from $1,743 million in fiscal 2018. Revenues from the Global Markets category 
posted year-over-year growth of 7%, with revenues from equity securities and from fixed-income 
securities each rising 8%, tempered by a 3% decrease in revenues from commodities and foreign 
exchange activities. As for corporate and investment banking revenues, they were down 4% year over 
year, mainly due to a slowdown in capital markets activity as well as to a decrease in merger and  41 % 
acquisition activities in fiscal 2019. This decrease was partly offset by higher banking services 
revenues in fiscal 2019. Lastly, higher gains on investments and other revenues were recorded in 
59 % 
fiscal 2018. 
For the year ended October 31, 2019, the segment’s non-interest expenses rose 7% year over year, 
mainly due to increases in compensation and employee benefits, in expenses related to technological 
investments, in business development expenses, and in operations support charges. The segment’s 
fiscal 2019 efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis(1) was 42.5% in fiscal 2019 versus 40.0% in 
2018.  Global markets (2018: 56%) 
Corporate and investment banking (2018: 43%) 
Gains on investments and other (2018: 1%) 
Financial Markets recorded $30 million in provisions for credit losses during fiscal 2019 compared to 
$4 million in fiscal 2018, an increase that stems mainly from credit loss provisions on impaired loans.

Despite global uncertainty negatively affecting exports and business investment, the U.S. economy posted steady growth in 2019 thanks to resilience in 
consumption. Consumer confidence in the U.S. is flying high given a still-hot labour market that is fuelling household income. Lower interest rates and low 
leverage suggest upside potential for household credit in the U.S.

The Cambodian economy is rapidly growing, with GDP growth nearing 7% in the past decade. It is a well-diversified economy, largely based on the U.S. dollar. 
The strong GDP growth is supported by its membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) trade association and an expansionary fiscal 
policy. The Cambodian market is highly underbanked, with approximately 8% of the population having a credit account and 40% having a deposit account.

In the USSF&I segment, the fiscal 2019 net income totalled $279 million compared to $222 million in 
1%
fiscal 2018. The segment’s fiscal 2019 total revenues amounted to $715 million versus $639 million 
in fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 12% that came mainly from a $111 million 
increase in the revenues of the ABA Bank subsidiary owing to sustained growth in loan and deposit 
volumes. At the Credigy subsidiary, revenues were down $44 million as a result of changes in the loan 
portfolio mix.

The segment’s non-interest expenses stood at $285 million in fiscal 2019, a $34 million year-over-
year increase essentially attributable to all of ABA Bank’s non-interest expenses and related to its  56%
growing banking network. At the Credigy subsidiary, non-interest expenses were down slightly year 
over year. 
In fiscal 2019, the segment recorded $80 million in provisions for credit losses, consisting essentially 
of Credigy’s credit loss provisions.

For the Other heading of segment results, there was a net loss of $200 million in fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $170 million in fiscal 2018. This change 
in net loss was essentially due to a lower contribution from treasury activities during fiscal 2019 arising in part from the impact of market volatility on the Bank’s 
asset/liability management portfolio during the first quarter of 2019. The specified items recorded for fiscal 2019 had a $6 million unfavourable impact on the 
net income recorded in the Other heading. Net loss excluding specified items stood at $194 million for fiscal 2019 compared to a $170 million net loss in fiscal 
2018.  
Total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis were up, mainly due to the specified items recorded for fiscal 2019, which include a $79 million gain on disposal 
of Fiera Capital shares, a $50 million gain on disposal of premises and equipment, and a $33 million loss arising from the fair value remeasurement of the Bank’s 
investment in NSIA. The fiscal 2019 non-interest expenses were also up as a result of the following specified items: $57 million in impairment losses on premises 
and equipment and on intangible assets, $45 million in provisions for onerous contracts, an $11 million charge related to Maple, and $10 million in severance

Several trends and factors have an impact on the Bank’s quarterly net income, revenues, non-interest expenses and provisions for credit losses. For example, 
the second quarter of the fiscal year has fewer days than the other quarters, which can result in reductions to total revenues and certain non-interest expense 
items. The following table presents a summary of results for the past eight quarters. Furthermore, a summary of results for the past 12 quarters is provided in

(1)  For additional information about the 2019 fourth quarter results, visit the Bank’s website at nbc.ca or the SEDAR website at sedar.com to consult the Bank’s Press Release for the Fourth Quarter 
of 2019, published on December 4, 2019. 
The above analysis of the past eight quarters reflects the sustained performance of all the business segments and helps readers identify the items that have 
favourably or unfavourably affected results. Thanks to net income growth across most of the Bank’s main business segments, the net income for each quarter of 
2019 was up year over year. However, the year-over-year growth in net income for the first and second quarters of 2019 was tempered somewhat by a slowdown 
in the activities of the Financial Markets segment.  
Net interest income posted year-over-year growth in every quarter of 2019. These increases were mainly driven by growth in personal and commercial loan and 
deposit volumes, net interest income growth at Wealth Management (notably due to loan and deposit growth) and to growth in the net interest income of the 
ABA Bank subsidiary. The year-over-year increases in net interest income for the first and third quarters of 2019 were tempered somewhat by lower net interest 
income in the Financial Markets segment. Furthermore, the Credigy subsidiary posted less net interest income in the first, second, and third quarters of 2019 as 
a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix. 
The non-interest income results for the first, second and fourth quarters of 2019 were down year over year. Non-interest income in the first and second quarters 
of 2019 was down year over year given a slowdown in the activities of the Financial Markets segment. The 2019 third-quarter non-interest income included a 
revision to actuarial reserves and the following specified items: a $79 million gain on disposal of Fiera Capital shares, a $50 million gain on disposal of premises 
and equipment, and a $33 million loss arising from the remeasurement at fair value of the Bank’s investment in NSIA.  
The provisions for credit losses posted year-over-year increases in almost every quarter of 2019. Higher credit loss provisions were recorded in the third and 
fourth quarters of 2019 as a result of provisions on personal loans, credit card receivables, and Financial Markets loans. For the second quarter of 2019, 
provisions for credit losses saw a year-over-year decrease, mainly due to provisions recorded on loans at the Credigy subsidiary. 
The non-interest expense results for every quarter of 2019 were up year over year. Explaining these increases were compensation and employee benefits 
(including the variable compensation associated with revenue growth in the business segments), technology investment expenses made as part of the Bank’s 
transformation plan and for business development activities, and expenses related to the expansion of ABA Bank’s banking network. In addition, non-interest 
expenses for the third quarter of 2019 included $57 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $45 million in provisions 
for onerous contracts, and $10 million in severance pay. For the fourth quarter of 2019, non-interest expenses included an $11 million charge related to Maple. 
The effective income tax rate for every quarter of 2019 was down year over year. These changes in effective tax rate between the quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 
created mainly by a realization of capital gains taxed at a lower rate, by higher income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, and by lower tax-exempt dividend income. 
In addition, the U.S. tax reform had an impact on the effective tax rate of the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

securities and to a $1.3 billion increase in securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Treasury, other U.S. agencies and other foreign governments. These increases 
were tempered by a $4.2 billion decrease in securities issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government and a $3.9 billion decrease in securities issued or 
guaranteed by Canadian provincial and municipal governments. Securities other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss were up $6.4 billion, 
essentially due to a $2.1 billion increase in securities issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government, to a $3.5 billion increase in securities issued or 
guaranteed by U.S. Treasury, other U.S. agencies, and other foreign governments, and to a $0.8 billion increase in other debt securities. Securities purchased 
under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed totalled $17.7 billion as at October 31, 2019, a 2% decrease since year-end 2018 that is mainly

Residential mortgage loans outstanding totalled $57.2 billion as at October 31, 2019, rising $3.5 billion or 7% since year-end 2018. This growth was driven by 
sustained demand for mortgage credit as well as by business growth at the ABA Bank subsidiary. Personal loans totalled $36.9 billion at year-end 2019, declining 
$0.5 billion from $37.4 billion at year-end 2018 due in part to changes in the loan portfolio mix of the Credigy subsidiary. As for credit card receivables, they 
totalled $2.3 billion, remaining stable when compared to October 31, 2018. 
At $57.5 billion as at October 31, 2019, loans and acceptances to businesses and government increased $4.1 billion or 8% since October 31, 2018. This increase 
was driven mainly by Commercial Banking and Credigy subsidiary activities. 
Table 9 (page 109) shows gross loans and acceptances by borrower category as at October 31, 2019. At $74.4 billion, residential mortgages (including home 
equity lines of credit) have posted strong growth since 2015 and account for 48% of total loans and acceptances. This growth in residential mortgages was 
driven by sustained demand for mortgage credit as well as by growth in business activity at the ABA Bank subsidiary. As for retail loans, they totalled $15.7 billion 
as at October 31, 2019. With respect to commercial loans, there was year-over-year growth in the agriculture category, utilities category, and manufacturing 
category. As at October 31, 2019, certain categories posted year-over-year decreases, notably the mining category, the finance and insurance category, and the 
government category. Furthermore, the Credigy subsidiary’s POCI  loans were down from October 31, 2018 due to maturities and repayments in certain portfolios.

As at October 31, 2019, gross impaired loans excluding POCI loans stood at $684 million compared to $630 million as at October 31, 2018 (Table 10, page 109). 
Net impaired loans excluding POCI loans totalled $450 million as at October 31, 2019 compared to $404 million as at October 31, 2018, a $46 million increase 
related to net impaired loans in the Commercial Banking portfolio and the Financial Markets segment. Gross POCI loans stood at $1,166 million as at October

As at October 31, 2019, other assets totalled $14.6 billion compared to $15.7 billion as at October 31, 2018. This $1.1 billion decrease in other assets can 
essentially be traced to a $0.5 billion decrease in derivative financial instruments and to a $0.4 billion decrease in other assets. Investments in associates and 
joint ventures declined due to the disposal of a portion of the Bank’s interest in Fiera Capital as well as to a conclusion to stop recognizing the equity stake in 
NSIA as an investment in an associate following a loss of significant influence. Premises and equipment also decreased due to the sale of the land and head 
office building occupied by the Bank.

At $189.6 billion as at October 31, 2019, deposits increased by $18.8 billion or 11% since year-end 2018. At $60.1 billion, personal deposits, as presented in 
Table 12 (page 110), increased $4.4 billion since October 31, 2018 and accounted for 32% of all deposits. This increase was driven by Bank initiatives designed 
to grow this type of deposit as well as by business growth at the ABA Bank subsidiary. A summary of total personal savings is provided in the table below. 
As shown in Table 12, business and government deposits totalled $125.3 billion, up $15.0 billion from $110.3 billion at year-end 2018. This increase came from 
business growth at Commercial Banking and from treasury funding activities, including $3.5 billion in deposits subject to bank recapitalization (bail-in) 
conversion regulations, from corporate financing activities and from issuances of structured notes. Deposits from deposit-taking institutions were down 
$0.6 billion from the same date last year. 
As at October 31, 2019, total personal savings amounted to $233.0 billion, up from $211.5 billion as at October 31, 2018. Overall, off-balance-sheet personal 
savings stood at $172.9 billion as at October 31, 2019 compared to $155.8 billion a year ago given net inflows in brokerage operations and stronger stock 
market performance.

As at October 31, 2019, equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders was $14.8 billion, rising $0.8 billion from $14.0 billion since October 31, 2018. This 
increase came from net income net of dividends, tempered by remeasurements of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, by a net change in 
gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and by repurchases of common shares for cancellation, factors which themselves were partly offset by issuances of common 
shares under the Stock Option Plan and the impact of shares purchased or sold for trading. The Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity on page 118 of

In 2012, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) formed a working group, the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF), that was mandated to develop principles for 
enhancing the risk disclosures of major banks. The EDTF published a report containing 32 recommendations. The risk disclosures required by the EDTF are 
provided in this Annual Report and in the documents entitled Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3 Disclosure and Supplementary Financial Information, 
which are available on the Bank’s website at nbc.ca. In addition, on page 12 of this Annual Report is a table of contents that readers can use to locate information 
relative to the 32 recommendations. 
The FSB recommendations seek to enhance the transparency and measurement of certain exposures, in particular structured entities, subprime and Alt-A 
exposures, collateralized debt obligations, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and leveraged financing structures. The Bank does not 
market any specific mortgage financing program to subprime or Alt-A clients. Alt-A loans are granted to borrowers who cannot provide standard proof of income. 
The Bank’s Alt-A loan volume was $402 million as at October 31, 2019 ($425 million as at October 31, 2018). The Bank does not have any significant direct 
position in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities that are not insured by the CMHC. Credit derivative positions are presented in the 
Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3 Disclosure report, which is available on the Bank’s website at nbc.ca. 
Leveraged finance is commonly employed to achieve a specific objective, for example, to make an acquisition, complete a buy-out or repurchase shares. 
Leveraged finance risk exposure takes the form of both funded and unfunded commitments. As at October 31, 2019, total commitments for this type of loan 
stood at $3,559 million ($2,967 million as at October 31, 2018). Details about other exposures are provided in the table concerning structured entities in Note 27

In the normal course of business, the Bank provides various banking services and enters into contractual agreements and other transactions with associates, 
joint ventures, directors, key officers and other related parties. These agreements and transactions are entered into under conditions similar to those offered to 
non-related third parties. 
In accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), the aggregate of loans granted to key officers of the Bank, excluding mortgage loans granted on their principal 
residence, cannot exceed twice the officer’s annual salary. 
Loans to eligible key officers are granted under the same conditions as those granted to any other employee of the Bank. The main conditions are as follows: 
 the employee must meet the same credit requirements as a client; 
 mortgage loans are offered at the preferential employee rate; 
 home equity lines of credit bear interest at Canadian prime less 0.5%, but never lower than Canadian prime divided by two; 
 personal loans bear interest at a risk-based regular client rate;
 credit card advances bear interest at a prescribed fixed rate in accordance with Bank policy;
 personal lines of credit bear interest at Canadian prime less 0.5%, but never lower than Canadian prime divided by two.
The Bank also offers a deferred stock unit plan to directors who are not Bank employees. For additional information, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial

In June 2019, the Bank was reassessed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for additional income tax and interest of approximately $150 million (including 
estimated provincial tax and interest) in respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during 2014.   
In prior fiscal years, the Bank was reassessed for additional income tax and interest of approximately $220 million (including provincial tax and interest) in 
respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during the 2013 and 2012 taxation years. 
The transactions to which the above-mentioned reassessments relate are similar to those prospectively addressed by income tax legislation enacted as a result 
of the 2015 Canadian federal budget. 
The CRA may issue reassessments to the Bank for taxation years subsequent to 2014 in regard to activities similar to those that were the subject of the 
above-mentioned reassessments. The Bank remains confident that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously defend its position. As a result, no

Mortgage Loans 
The Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the Mortgage-Backed Securities Program under the 
National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) Program. Under the first program, the Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured 
residential mortgage loans and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the 
issuance of mortgage bonds insured by CMHC. Moreover, these mortgage bonds feature an interest rate swap agreement under which a CMHC-certified 
counterparty pays CHT the interest due to investors and receives the interest on the NHA securities. As at October 31, 2019, the outstanding amount of NHA 
securities issued by the Bank and sold to CHT was $19.2 billion. The mortgage loans sold consist of fixed- or variable-rate residential loans that are insured 
against potential losses by a loan insurer. In accordance with the NHA-MBS Program, the Bank advances the funds required to cover late payments and, if 
necessary, obtains reimbursement from the insurer that insured the loan. The NHA-MBS and CMB programs do not use liquidity guarantee arrangements. The 
Bank uses these securitization programs mainly to diversify its funding sources. In accordance with IFRS, because the Bank retains substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the mortgage loans transferred to CHT, the derecognition criteria are not met. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans securitized 
under the CMB Program continue to be recognized in Loans on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the liabilities for the considerations received from 
the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information, see Note 8 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Credit Card Receivables 
In April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its program of securitizing credit card receivables on a revolving basis. The Bank 
uses this entity for capital management and funding purposes. The Bank acts as the servicer of the receivables sold and maintains the client relationship. 
Furthermore, it administers the securitization program and ensures that all related procedures are stringently followed and that investors are paid according to 
the provisions of the program. 
As at October 31, 2019, the credit card receivables portfolio held by CCCT II (net of the Bank Certificate held by the Bank) represented an amount outstanding of 
$1.6 billion. CCCT II issued investors’ certificates, $0.9 billion of which is held by third parties and $0.7 billion is held by the Bank. New receivables are 
periodically sold to the structure on a revolving basis to replace the receivables reimbursed by clients. 
The different series of certificates are rated by the Fitch and DBRS rating agencies. From this portfolio of sold receivables, the Bank retains the excess spread, 
i.e., the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid, and thus provides first-loss protection. Furthermore, second-
loss protection for issued series is provided by certificates subordinated to the senior notes, representing 5.8% of the total amount of the series issued. The 
Bank controls CCCT II and thus consolidates it.

The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the

assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The 
Bank acts as a financial agent and provides administrative and transaction structuring services to these conduits. The Bank provides backstop liquidity and 
credit enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Notes 26 and 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Bank has concluded derivative financial instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank’s

The Bank’s capital management policy defines guiding principles as well as the roles and responsibilities of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. 
This process aims to determine the capital that the Bank needs to pursue its business activities and accommodate unexpected losses arising from extremely 
adverse economic and operational conditions. The Bank has implemented a rigorous internal capital adequacy assessment process that comprises the following 
procedures: 
 conducting an overall risk assessment;
 measuring significant risks and the capital requirements related to the Bank’s financial budget for the next fiscal year and current and prospective risk
profiles; 
 integrating stress tests across the organization and executing sensitivity analyses to determine the capital buffer above minimum regulatory levels (for
additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see the Risk Management section of this MD&A); 
 aggregating capital and monitoring the reasonableness of internal capital compared with regulatory capital; 
 comparing projected internal capital with regulatory capital levels, internal operating targets, and competing banks;
 attesting to the adequacy of the Bank’s capital levels.
Assessing capital adequacy is an integral part of capital planning and strategy. The Bank sets internal capital ratio targets that include a discretionary cushion 
in excess of the regulatory requirements, which provides a solid financial structure and sufficient capital to meet management’s business needs in accordance 
with its risk appetite, along with competitive returns to shareholders, under both normal market conditions and a range of severe but plausible stress testing 
scenarios. The internal capital adequacy assessment process is a key tool in establishing the Bank’s capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and 
periodic amendments. 
Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) and shareholder value added (SVA), which are obtained from an assessment of required economic capital, are calculated 
quarterly for each of the Bank’s business segments. The results are then used to guide management in allocating capital among the different business segments. 
SSttrruuccttuurree  aanndd  GGoovveerrnnaannccee  
Along with its partners from Risk Management, Global Funding and Treasury Group, and Finance, the Capital Management team is responsible for maintaining 
integrated control methods and processes so that an overall assessment of capital adequacy may be performed. 
The Board oversees the structure and development of the Bank’s capital management policy and ensures that the Bank maintains sufficient capital in accordance 
with regulatory requirements and in consideration of market conditions. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Risk Management Committee (RMC), 
which in turn recommends capital management policies and oversees their application. However, the Board, on the recommendation of the RMC, assumes the 
following responsibilities: 
 reviewing and approving the capital management policy;
 reviewing and approving the Bank’s risk appetite, including the main capital and risk targets and the corresponding limits;
 reviewing and approving the capital plan and strategy on an annual basis, including the Bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process; 
 reviewing and approving the implementation of significant measures respecting capital, including contingency measures;
 reviewing significant capital disclosures, including Basel capital adequacy ratios;
 ensuring the appropriateness of the regulatory capital adequacy assessment.
The Office of the President is responsible for defining the Bank’s strategy and plays a key role in guiding measures and decisions regarding capital. The 
Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee oversees capital management, which consists of reviewing the capital plan and strategy and implementing 
significant measures respecting capital, including contingency measures, and making recommendations with respect to these measures.

BBaasseell  AAccccoorrdd  
The Basel Accord proposes a range of approaches of varying complexity, the choice of which determines the sensitivity of capital to risks. A less complex 
approach, such as the Standardized Approach, uses regulatory weightings, while a more complex approach uses the Bank’s internal estimates of risk 
components to establish risk-weighted assets and calculate regulatory capital. 
As required under Basel, risk-weighted assets (RWA) are calculated for each credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. The Bank uses the Advanced Internal 
Rating-Based (AIRB) Approach for credit risk to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for a majority of its portfolios. The credit risk of certain 
portfolios considered to be less significant is weighted according to the Basel Standardized Approach. The simple risk-weighted method is used to calculate the 
charge related to banking book equity securities. This method requires proactive management of the capital allocated to portfolios with banking book equity 
securities since, beyond a certain investment threshold, the cost of regulatory capital becomes prohibitive. As for operational risk, the Bank uses the 
Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are primarily determined using the Internal Model-Based Approach, but the Standardized Approach is used 
to assess interest-rate specific risk.  
With respect to the risk related to securitization operations, the capital treatment depends on the type of underlying exposures and on the information available 
about the exposures. The Bank must use the Securitization Internal Rating-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) if it is able to apply an approved internal ratings-based 
model and has sufficient information to calculate the capital requirements for all underlying exposures in the securitization pool. Under this approach, the RWA 
is derived from a combination of supervisory inputs and inputs specific to the securitization exposure such as the implicit capital charge related to the underlying 
exposures, the credit enhancement level, the effective maturity, the number of exposures, and the weighted average loss given default (LGD).   
If the Bank cannot use the SEC-IRBA, it must use the Securitization External Rating-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) for the securitization exposures that are externally 
rated. This approach assigns risk weights to exposures using external ratings. The Bank uses the ratings assigned by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch, 
DBRS or a combination of these ratings. The Bank uses the Internal Assessment Approach (IAA) for unrated securitization exposures relating to the asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits it sponsors. If the Bank cannot apply the SEC-ERBA or the IAA, it must use the supervisory formula under the Securitization 
Standardized Approach (SEC-SA). Under this approach, RWA is derived from inputs specific to the securitization exposure such as the implicit capital charge 
related to the underlying exposures calculated under the standardized credit risk approach as well as credit enhancement and delinquency levels.  
If none of the above approaches can be used, the securitization exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250%. The Bank can apply a reduced capital charge 
for securitization exposures that meet the criteria of the Simple, Transparent and Comparable (STC) framework. To mitigate the impact of the revised 
securitization framework, which took effect on November 1, 2018, OSFI has permitted grandfathering of the current capital treatment for one year through a 
negative adjustment to RWA that eliminates the initial increase in risk weights. OSFI has also provided transitional arrangements for all securitization 
transactions completed by December 31, 2018 for a maximum of two years. 
Capital ratios are calculated by dividing capital by risk-weighted assets. Credit, market, and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets 
calculation for regulatory purposes. Basel rules apply at the consolidated level of the Bank. Assets of non-consolidated entities for regulatory purposes are 
therefore excluded from the risk-weighted assets calculation. 
The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital 
consists of common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, intangible assets, and other capital deductions. The Additional Tier 1 instruments comprise eligible non-
cumulative preferred shares and the eligible amount of innovative instruments. The sum of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 
capital. Tier 2 capital consists of eligible subordinated debt and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

Capital Management 
OSFI is responsible for applying the Basel Accord in Canada. As required under the Basel Accord, OSFI requires that regulatory capital instruments other than 
common equity have a non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) clause to ensure that investors bear losses before taxpayers should the government determine 
that it is in the public interest to rescue a non-viable financial institution. Instruments issued before January 1, 2013 that would be Basel III compliant if it were 
not for the absence of the NVCC clause are grandfathered and will be phased out over a period of ten years. The Bank expects to phase out all of its non-NVCC 
instruments without resorting to any regulatory event redemption. Furthermore, in the regulations of the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act and 
the Bank Act (Canada), the Government of Canada has provided detailed information on conversion, issuance, and compensation regimes for bail-in instruments 
issued by D-SIBs. Pursuant to the CDIC Act, in circumstances where OSFI has determined that the Bank has ceased, or is about to cease, to be viable, the Governor 
in Council may, upon a Minister of Finance recommendation indicating that he or she believes that it is in the public interest to do so, grant an order directing 
CDIC to convert all or a portion of certain shares and liabilities of the Bank into common shares of the Bank (a “Bail-In Conversion”). The Bail-in Regulations 
governing the conversion and issuance of bail-in instruments came into force on September 23, 2018, and those governing compensation for holders of 
converted instruments came into force on March 27, 2018. Any shares and liabilities issued before the date that the Bail-In Regulations come into force are not 
subject to a Bail-In Conversion, unless, in the case of a liability, the terms of such liability are, on or after that day, amended to increase its principal amount or 
to extend its term to maturity, and the liability, as amended, meets the requirements to be subject to a Bail-In Conversion. The Bail-in Regulations did not have 
a material impact on the Bank’s funding plan. 
The Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 capital 
ratio of at least 11.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 13.5%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, a 1% surcharge applicable 
solely to D-SIBs, and a 2.0% domestic stability buffer. The domestic stability buffer, which can vary from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively 
of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement will not be subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but will have to 
provide a remediation plan to OSFI. The banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II standardized 
approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 75% of the capital requirements as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to risk-
weighted assets. OSFI requires Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is 
calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative 
exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total 
exposure.  
OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline, which applies to all D-SIBs under the federal government’s bail-in regulations, came into effect on 
September 23, 2018. The purpose of the TLAC guideline is to ensure that a D-SIB has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization in the 
unlikely event it becomes non-viable. OSFI is requiring D-SIBs to maintain a minimum risk-based TLAC ratio of 23.50% (including the domestic stability buffer) 
of risk-weighted assets and a minimum TLAC leverage ratio of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. During the quarter ended April 30, 2019, the Bank started to issue 
qualifying bail-in debt and expects its TLAC ratios to improve through the normal refinancing of its maturing unsecured term debt. The Bank does not anticipate 
any challenges in meeting these TLAC requirements.

(2)  For D-SIBs, the buffer level varies between 0% and 2.5% of risk-weighted assets and is set by OSFI.  
The Bank ensures that its capital levels are always above the minimum capital requirements set by OSFI, including the buffer. By maintaining a strong capital 
structure, the Bank can cover the risks inherent to its business activities, support its business segments, and protect its clients.

The Bank closely monitors regulatory developments and participates actively in various consultative processes. Presented below are brief descriptions of 
ongoing regulatory projects. As had been planned, the Bank applied several new regulatory requirements in 2019, in particular the SA-CCR (Standardized 
Approach for Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk) rules and the revised securitization framework (described above).  
Basel III Reform 
In December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the BCBS, endorsed the outstanding Basel III post-
crisis regulatory reforms. The purpose of the approved reforms, set out in Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms, is to reduce excessive variability in risk-
weighted assets and improve comparability and transparency among bank capital ratios. The reforms must be implemented starting in 2022 and include the 
following: revisions to the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and operational risk; a constraint on using the internal ratings-based approach for 
calculating credit risk; and revisions to the leverage ratio, the CVA, and the calculation of the output capital floor. In February 2018, the BCBS issued Pillar 3 
Disclosure Requirements – Updated Framework, a consultative document that presents the additional disclosure requirements that will apply when the 
outstanding Basel III regulatory reforms take effect as of 2022, and these requirements will form a single Pillar 3 disclosure framework. In January 2019, the 
BCBS also issued a newly revised version of the document entitled Revisions to the Minimum Capital Requirements for Market Risk (initially issued in 
March 2018), which will have to be applied as of 2022. 
In July 2018, OSFI issued a discussion paper, Implementation of the Final Basel III Reforms in Canada, which sets out OSFI’s preliminary views on the scope and 
timelines for implementing the final Basel III reforms in Canada. 
Other Projects 
On April 10, 2019, OSFI released the final version of its B-2 guideline, Large Exposure Limits for Domestic Systemically Important Banks. Large exposure limits 
help to restrict the maximum loss that an institution could face in the event of a sudden failure of a counterparty. This new version of the B-2 guideline tightens 
the exposure limits applicable to Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and to other Canadian D-SIBs. It recognizes eligible credit risk mitigation 
techniques by measuring exposures on a net basis rather than a gross basis, and it reduces the eligible capital base by replacing Total capital with Tier 1 capital. 
All D-SIBs are expected to comply with the B-2 guideline for the period beginning November 1, 2019. 
On May 30, 2019, OSFI released a revised version of its B-12 guideline, Interest Rate Risk Management. This guideline outlines OSFI’s expectations regarding 
the management of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) in areas such as governance processes, risk measurement, development of stress test 
scenarios as well as key behavioural and modelling assumptions. D-SIBs will have to apply this revised guideline as of January 1, 2020. 
On June 26, 2019, the BCBS finalized revisions to the leverage ratio’s treatment of client-cleared derivatives and to disclosure requirements in order to address 
concerns about balance sheet window-dressing. The treatment of client-cleared derivatives was revised to align the leverage ratio measurement with the 
measurement determined by the SA-CCR rules as used for risk-based capital requirements. The revision to Revisions to Leverage Ratio Disclosure Requirements 
aims to alleviate leverage ratio balance sheet window-dressing concerns. Internationally active banks will be required to disclose their leverage ratios based on 
quarter-end values and on an average of daily values for securities financing transactions. These revisions will come into effect on January 1, 2022.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank repurchased 4,547,200 common shares for $281 million, which reduced Common share capital by 
$40 million and Retained earnings by $241 million. The repurchase of 2,347,200 common shares was part of the normal course issuer bid to repurchase for 
cancellation program that the Bank had launched on June 6, 2018 and that ended on June 5, 2019; under this program, the Bank repurchased a total of 6,847,200 
common shares. On June 10, 2019, the Bank began a new normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 6,000,000 common shares over the 12-
month period ending no later than June 9, 2020. During the year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank repurchased 2,200,000 common shares under the new 
program.  
As at October 31, 2019, the Bank had 334,172,411 issued and outstanding common shares compared to 335,070,642 a year earlier as well as 98,000,000 
issued and outstanding preferred shares, unchanged from October 31, 2018. For additional information on capital instruments, see Notes 15, 18 and 19 to the

The Bank’s strategy for common share dividends is to aim for a dividend payout ratio of between 40% and 50% of net income attributable to common 
shareholders excluding specified items, taking into account such factors as financial position, cash needs, regulatory requirements and any other factor deemed 
relevant by the Board.

For fiscal 2019, the Bank declared $892 million in dividends to common shareholders, which represents 42% of net income attributable to common shareholders 
(2018: 41%). The declared dividends are within the target payout range. The Bank has taken a prudent approach to managing regulatory capital and remains 
confident in its ability to increase earnings going forward.

As at November 29, 2019, there were 334,201,015 common shares and 12,076,868 stock options outstanding. NVCC provisions require the conversion of capital 
instruments into a variable number of common shares should OSFI deem a bank to be non-viable or should the government publicly announce that a bank has 
accepted or agreed to accept an injection of capital. If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, all of the Bank’s preferred shares and medium-term notes maturing 
on February 1, 2028, which are NVCC capital instruments, would be converted into common shares of the Bank according to an automatic conversion formula at 
a conversion price corresponding to the greater of the following amounts: (i) a $5.00 contractual floor price; or (ii) the market price of the Bank’s common shares 
on the date of the trigger event (10-day weighted average price). Based on a $5.00 floor price and including an estimate for accrued dividends and interest, these 
NVCC capital instruments would be converted into a maximum of 723 million Bank common shares, which would have a 68.4% dilutive effect based on the 
number of Bank common shares outstanding as at October 31, 2019.

As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios were, respectively, 11.7%, 15.0% and 16.1%, i.e., above the regulatory requirements, 
compared to ratios of, respectively, 11.7%, 15.5% and 16.8% as at October 31, 2018. The CET1 capital ratio remained stable. Net income net of dividends, and 
common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan offset the application of the SA-CCR rules for measuring counterparty credit risk, growth in risk-weighted 
assets, the common share repurchases during the year ended October 31, 2019, and remeasurements of pension plans and other post-employment benefit 
plans. The decreases in the Tier 1 capital ratio and the Total capital ratio were essentially due to growth in risk-weighted assets. As at October 31, 2019, the 
leverage ratio was 4.0%, stable compared to October 31, 2018. The growth in Tier 1 capital was offset by growth in total leverage exposure.

The table above provides the risk-weighted assets movements by key drivers underlying the different risk categories. 
The “Book size” item reflects organic changes in book size and composition (including new loans and maturing loans). RWA movements attributable to book size 
include increases or decreases in exposures, measured by exposure at default, assuming a stable risk profile.  
The “Book quality” item is the Bank’s best estimate of changes in book quality related to experience, such as underlying customer behaviour or demographics, 
including changes resulting from model recalibrations or realignments and also including risk mitigation factors.  
The “Model updates” item is used to reflect implementations of new models, changes in model scope, and any other change applied to address model 
malfunctions. During the quarter ended July 31, 2019, the Bank updated its models for credit card portfolios and energy sector loans. 
The “Methodology and policy” item presents the impact of changes in calculation methods resulting from changes in regulatory policies as a result, for example, 
of new regulations. During the quarter ended January 31, 2019, the Bank implemented the SA-CCR rules for measuring counterparty credit risk under the 
standardized approach, as required by the BCBS. During the quarter ended October 31, 2019, the Bank refined the risk-weight calculation method for derivative 
financial instruments.

Economic capital is an internal measure that the Bank uses to determine the capital it needs to remain solvent and to pursue its business operations. Economic 
capital takes into consideration the credit, market, operational, business and other risks to which the Bank is exposed as well as the risk diversification effect 
among them and among the business segments. Economic capital thus helps the Bank to determine the capital required to protect itself against such risks and 
ensure its long-term viability. The by-segment allocation of economic capital and regulatory RWA was done on a stand-alone basis before attribution of goodwill 
and intangible assets. The method used to assess economic capital is reviewed regularly in order to accurately quantify these risks. 
The Risk Management section of this MD&A provides comprehensive information about the main types of risk. The “Other risks” presented below include risks 
such as business risk and structural interest rate risk in addition to the benefit of diversification among types of risk.

Risk-taking is intrinsic to a financial institution’s business. The Bank views risk as an integral part of its development and the diversification of its activities. It 
advocates a risk management approach consistent with its business strategy. The Bank voluntarily exposes itself to certain risk categories, particularly credit 
and market risk, in order to generate revenue. It assumes certain risks that are inherent to its activities—to which it does not choose to expose itself—and that 
do not generate revenue, i.e., mainly operational risks. The purpose of sound and effective risk management is to provide reasonable assurance that incurred 
risks do not exceed acceptable thresholds, to control the volatility in the Bank's results, and to ensure that risk-taking contributes to the creation of shareholder 
value.  
RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk  
Risk is rigorously managed. Risks are identified, measured and controlled to achieve an appropriate balance between the returns obtained and the risks 
assumed. Consequently, decision-making is supported by risk assessments and management processes that are consistent with the Bank’s risk appetite and 
by prudent levels of capital and liquidity. Despite the exercise of stringent risk management and the mitigation measures in place, risk cannot be suppressed 
entirely, and residual risks may occasionally cause significant losses.  
The Bank has developed guidelines that support sound and effective risk management: 
• risk is everyone’s business: business units, risk management and oversight functions as well as Internal Audit play an important role in ensuring a risk
management framework is in place; 
• client-centric: having quality information is key to understanding clients, effectively managing risk, and delivering excellent client service;
• enterprise-wide: an integrated view of risk is the basis for sound and effective risk management and decision-making by management;
• human capital: the Bank’s employees are engaged, experienced and have a high level of expertise; their curiosity supports continuous development and
their rigour ensures that risk management is built into the corporate culture; 
• fact-based: good risk management relies heavily on common sense and good judgment and on advanced systems and models.
RRiisskk  AAppppeettiittee  
Risk appetite represents how much risk an organization is willing to assume to achieve its business strategy. The Bank defines its risk appetite by setting 
tolerance thresholds, by aligning those thresholds with its business strategy, and by integrating risk management throughout its corporate culture. Risk appetite 
is built into decision-making processes as well as into strategic, financial and capital planning. 
The Bank’s risk appetite framework consists of principles, statements, metrics as well as targets and is reinforced by policies and limits. When setting its risk 
appetite targets, the Bank considers regulatory constraints and the expectations of stakeholders, in particular customers, employees, the community, 
shareholders, regulatory agencies, governments, and rating agencies.  
The risk appetite framework is defined by the following principles and statements: 
The Bank’s brand, reputation and long-term viability are at the centre of our decisions, which demand: 
• a strong credit rating to be maintained;
• a strong capital and cash position;
• rigorous management of regulatory compliance risk, including sales practices;
• zero tolerance for negligence in information security.
The Bank understands the risks taken; they are aligned with our business strategy and translate into: 
• a risk-reward balance;
• a stable risk profile; 
• a strategic level of concentration aligned with approved targets.
The Bank’s transformation and simplification plan is being carried out without compromising rigorous risk management, which is reflected in: 
• a low tolerance to operational and reputation risk;
• operational and information systems stability, both under normal circumstances and in times of crisis.

Risk Management   
 
  
The Bank’s management and business units are involved in the process for setting the risk appetite and are responsible for adequately monitoring the chosen 
risk indicators. These needs are assessed by means of the enterprise strategic planning process. The risk indicators are reported on a regular basis to ensure an 
effective alignment of the Bank’s risk profile to its risk appetite; otherwise, appropriate actions could be taken. Additional information on the key credit, market 
and liquidity risk indicators monitored by the Bank’s management is presented on the following pages.

As part of a more extensive process aimed at ensuring that the Bank maintains adequate capital levels commensurate with its business strategy and risk appetite, 
an enterprise-wide stress testing program is in place at the Bank. Stress testing can be defined as a risk management method that assesses the potential 
effects—on the Bank’s financial position, capital and liquidity—of a series of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible events. 
The program supports management’s decision-making process by identifying potential vulnerabilities for the Bank as a whole that are considered in setting 
limits as well as in longer term business planning. The scenarios and stress test results are reviewed by a group of stress testing experts, a stress testing 
oversight group and the Global Risk Committee (GRC) and are approved by the Board. For additional information, see the Stress Testing and Crisis Scenarios 
sections of this MD&A applicable to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.

The Bank’s management continually promotes risk management through internal communications. A balanced approach is advocated, whereby business 
development initiatives are combined with a constant focus on sound and effective risk management. In particular, risk is taken into consideration when 
preparing the segments’ business plans, when analyzing strategic initiatives and when launching new products. The Bank’s risk management is also 
strengthened by incentive compensation programs that are structured to reflect the Bank’s risk appetite. In addition, Internal Audit carries out an evaluation of 
the culture through its mandates. Finally, all employees must complete mandatory annual regulatory compliance training focused on the Bank’s Code of Conduct 
and Ethics and on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) efforts. Risk management training is also offered across all segments of the 
Bank.  
 
Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the existing risk management framework, the Bank has defined clear roles and responsibilities by reinforcing the 
concept of the three lines of defence. The Governance Structure section presented on the following pages defines this concept as well as the roles and 
responsibilities at all levels of the organization.

The Board of Directors (Board)(1) 
The Board examines and approves the Bank’s overall risk philosophy and risk appetite, acknowledges and understands the main risks faced by the Bank, and 
makes sure appropriate systems are in place to effectively manage and control those risks. In addition, the Board ensures that the Bank operates in accordance 
with environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and strategies. It performs its mandate both directly and through its committees, particularly the 
Audit Committee, the Risk Management Committee, the Human Resources Committee, and the Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee. 
The Audit Committee(1) 
The Audit Committee oversees the work of the Bank’s internal auditor and independent auditor; ensures the Bank's financial strength; establishes the Bank’s 
financial reporting framework, analysis processes and internal controls; and reviews any reports of irregularities in accounting, internal controls, and audit.  
The Risk Management Committee (RMC)(1) 
The Risk Management Committee examines the risk appetite framework and recommends it to the Board for approval. It approves the main risk management 
policies and risk tolerance limits. It ensures that appropriate resources, processes and procedures are in place to properly and effectively manage risk on an 
ongoing basis. Finally, it monitors the risk profile and risk trends of the Bank’s activities and ensures alignment with the risk appetite. 
The Human Resources Committee(1) 
The Human Resources Committee examines and approves the Bank’s total compensation policies and programs, taking into consideration the risk management 
framework, and recommends their approval to the Board. It sets annual objectives and key performance indicators for the President and Chief Executive Officer, 
recommends that they be approved by the Board, and evaluates the performance and achievements against these objectives and indicators. It recommends to 
the Board that it approves the compensation of the President and Chief Executive Officer, of the members of the Office of the President, and of the heads of the 
oversight functions. It also periodically reviews and examines the management succession plan. 
The Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee(1) 
The Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee ensures that the Bank maintains sound practices that comply with legislation and best practices, 
particularly in the area of ESG responsibilities. It must ensure that the directors are qualified by evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the Board and 
its members and by planning director succession and the composition of the Board. The Committee ensures that mechanisms are in place to prevent prohibited 
financial transactions between the Bank and related parties.

Risk Management 
The Office of the President and the Bank’s Management 
Composed of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the officers responsible for the Bank’s main functions and business units, the Office of the President 
ensures that risk management is effective and aligned with the Bank’s pursuit of its objectives and strategies. The Bank’s management promotes the integration 
of risk management into its corporate culture and manages the primary risks facing the Bank. 
The Internal Audit Oversight Function 
The Internal Audit Oversight Function is the third line of defence in the risk management framework. It is responsible for providing the Bank’s Board and 
management with objective, independent assurance as well as advice on the effectiveness and efficiency of the main governance, risk management, and internal 
control processes and systems and for making recommendations and providing advice to promote the Bank’s long-term strength. 
The Finance Oversight Function 
The Finance Oversight Function is responsible for optimizing management of financial resources and ensuring sound governance of financial information. It helps 
the business segments and support functions with their financial performance, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and carries out the Bank’s 
reporting to shareholders and the external reporting of the various units, entities and subsidiaries of the Bank. It is responsible for capital management and 
actively participates in the activities of the Asset/Liability Management Committee.
The Risk Management Oversight Function 
The Risk Management Oversight Function is responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring—independently and using an integrated approach—the 
various risks to which the Bank is exposed and for promoting a risk management culture within the Bank. The Risk Management team helps the Board and 
management understand and monitor the main risks. The unit also develops, maintains and communicates the risk appetite framework while overseeing the 
integrity and reliability of risk measures. 
The Compliance Oversight Function 
The Compliance Oversight Function is responsible for implementing a Bank-wide regulatory compliance risk management framework by relying on an 
organizational structure that includes functional links to the main business segments. It also exercises independent oversight and evaluation of the compliance 
of the Bank and its subsidiaries with standards and policies on regulatory compliance risk. 
The Compensation Risk Oversight Working Group 
The working group that monitors compensation-related risks supports the Human Resources Committee in its compensation risk oversight role. It is a three-
member group consisting of the Executive Vice-President, Risk Management; the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance; and the Executive 
Vice-President, Employee Experience. The working group helps to ensure that compensation policies and programs do not unduly encourage senior management 
members, officers, material risk takers or bank employees to take risks beyond the Bank’s risk tolerance thresholds. As part of that role, it ensures that the Bank 
is adhering to the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by OSFI and to the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability 
Board, for which the Canadian implementation and monitoring is conducted by OSFI. The Board’s Risk Management Committee also reviews the reports 
presented by the working group to the Human Resources Committee. 
The Global Risk Committee (GRC) 
The Global Risk Committee defines the parameters of the policies that determine risk tolerance and the overall risk strategy, for the Bank and its subsidiaries as 
a whole, and sets limits as well as tolerance and intervention thresholds enabling the Bank to properly manage the main risks to which it is exposed. The 
committee approves and monitors all large credit facilities. It also recommends for Board approval the Bank’s risk philosophy, risk appetite and risk profile 
management. The Operational Risk Management Committee, the Financial Markets Risk Committee, and the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee 
presented in the governance structure diagram are the primary committees reporting to the Global Risk Committee. The Global Risk Committee also carries out 
its mandate through the Senior Complex Valuation Committee, the Committee on Banks, the Models Oversight Committee and the Product and Activity Review 
Committees. 
The Business Units 
As the first line of defence, the business units manage risks related to their operations within established limits and in accordance with risk management policies 
by identifying, analyzing and understanding the risks to which they are exposed and implementing risk mitigation mechanisms. The management of these units 
must ensure that employees are adhering to current policies and limits.

The risk management policies and related standards and procedures set out responsibilities, define and describe the main activity-related risks, specify the 
requirements that the business units must meet in assessing and managing risk, stipulate the authorization process for risk-taking and set the risk limits to be 
adhered to. These policies cover the main risks in the Bank, are reviewed regularly to ensure they are still relevant given changes in the markets and in the 
business plans of the Bank’s business units, and apply to the entire Bank and its subsidiaries. Other policies, standards, and procedures complement the main 
policies and cover more specific aspects of risk management such as business continuity, the launch of new products, initiatives or activities, or financial 
instrument measurement.  
GGoovveerrnnaannccee  ooff  MMooddeell  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  
The Bank makes increasing use of models to guide enterprise-wide risk management, financial markets strategy, economic and regulatory capital allocation, 
global credit risk management, wealth management and profitability measures. Models have in fact become a standard in risk management. This stresses the 
growing importance of model risk for banks, hence the implementation of a rigorous model risk management process to ensure models can be used appropriately 
and efficiently to manage risks. 
The key components of the Bank’s model risk management governance framework are as follows: the model risk management policies and standards, the model 
vetting group, and the Models Oversight Committee. The policies and standards set the rules and principles applicable to developing and vetting models. The 
scope of models covered is wide, ranging from market risk pricing models and automated credit decision-making models to the business risk capital model, 
including models used for regulatory capital and stressed capital purposes, IFRS 9 models, and financial-crime models. The framework also includes more 
advanced artificial intelligence models. 
One of the cornerstones of the Bank’s policies is the general principle that all models deemed important for the Bank or used for regulatory capital purposes 
require heightened lifecycle monitoring and independent vetting. All models used by the Bank are therefore classified in terms of risk level (low, medium, or 
high). Based on this classification, the Bank applies strict guidelines regarding the requirements for model development and documentation, independent review 
thereof, performance monitoring thereof, and minimum review frequency. The Bank believes that the best defence against “model risk” is the implementation 
of a robust development and validation framework.

Compliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank. Its Senior Vice-President and Chief Compliance Officer has direct access to the RMC and to 
the President and Chief Executive Officer and can communicate directly with officers and directors of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres. The 
Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer regularly meets with the Chair of the RMC (with whom she has a direct 
reporting relationship) in the absence of management, to review matters on the relationship between the Compliance Service and the Bank’s management and 
on access to the information required.
Business unit managers must oversee the implementation of mechanisms for the daily control of regulatory compliance risks arising from the operations under 
their responsibility. Compliance exercises independent oversight in order to assist managers in effectively managing these risks and to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the Bank is compliant with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.

Internal Audit is an independent, objective function within the Bank. Through the Audit Committee, it provides assurance to management and the Board as to 
the Bank’s level of command over its activities, advises on how to improve those activities, and contributes to the creation of added value. It helps the Bank to 
achieve its objectives by applying a systematic, methodical approach for assessing and improving the effectiveness of the design and operation of its main 
governance, risk management and internal control processes and systems and formulates recommendations to promote the Bank’s long-term strength. 
Whenever recommendations are issued, Internal Audit is mandated to independently evaluate the appropriateness of the measures taken by managers to resolve 
issues and then to ensure rigorous follow-up. The Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit reports to the Chair of the Audit Committee. Her independence is ensured 
through an administrative relationship with the President and Chief Executive Officer, and she may, at any time, call an unscheduled Audit Committee meeting.  
Internal Audit has unrestricted access to all business segments, corporate units and subsidiaries of the Bank.

Top and emerging risks are risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial results, reputation, or long-term business model and strategy. 
The Bank’s processes are designed to detect and assess these risks as early as possible so that appropriate mitigating strategies can be applied.  
Managing risk requires a solid understanding of every type of risk found across the Bank. The Bank therefore maintains an inventory of the main risks and the 
emerging risks to which it is exposed. Doing so makes it easier to identify and effectively manage risks. In the normal course of business, the Bank is primarily 
exposed to the following risks. 
Credit  Market  Funding and  Operational  Regulatory  Reputation   Strategic  Environmental

The Bank is also exposed to other significant and emerging risks, as defined below.

Technology, which is now omnipresent in our daily lives, is at the heart of banking services and has become the main 
driver of innovation in the financial sector. While this digital transformation meets the growing needs of customers while 
enhancing the operational efficiency of institutions, it nevertheless comes with information security and cybersecurity 
risks. The personal information and financial data of financial institution customers are prime targets for criminals. These 
criminals, who are increasingly well organized and employing ever more sophisticated schemes, try to use technology to 
steal information. 
Faced with a resurgence of cyberthreats and the sophistication of cybercriminals, the Bank is exposed to the risks 
associated with data breaches, malicious software, unauthorized access, hacking, phishing, identity theft, intellectual 
property theft, asset theft, industrial espionage, and possible denial of service due to activities causing network failures 
and service interruptions.  
Cyberattacks, as with system breaches or interruptions that support the Bank and its customers, could cause client 
attrition; financial loss; inability of clients to do their banking; non-compliance with privacy legislation or any other laws 
in effect; legal disputes; fines; penalties or regulatory action; reputational damage; compliance costs, corrective 
IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn   measures, investigative, or restoration costs; cost hikes to maintain and upgrade technological infrastructures and 
sseeccuurriittyy  aanndd   systems, all of which could affect the Bank’s operating results or financial position.  
ccyybbeerrsseeccuurriittyy  
It is also possible for the Bank to be unable to prevent or implement effective preventive measures against every potential 
cyberthreat, as the tactics used are multiplying, change frequently, come from a wide range of sources and are 
increasingly sophisticated.  
Within this context, the Bank works to ensure the integrity and protection of its systems and information. The Bank 
reaffirms its commitment to continuous improvement in the area of information security, the ultimate goal being to protect 
its customers and maintain their trust. Along with its partners in the financial sector and with the regulatory authorities, 
the Bank is committed to making a sustained effort to mitigate technology risks. Measures specifically directed at 
anticipating this type of threat include the formation of multidisciplinary teams comprising cybersecurity and fraud 
prevention specialists. The Bank is also pursuing initiatives under its own cybersecurity program aimed at adapting its 
protection, surveillance, detection and response capabilities in response to changing threats. A governance and 
accountability structure has also been established to support decision-making based on sound risk management. The 
RMC is regularly informed of cybersecurity trends and developments and of lessons learned from operational incidents 
that have occurred in other large organizations in order to gain a better understanding of potential risks, particularly risks 
related to cybersecurity and the protection of personal information.

The current economic expansion in the United States has become the longest since World War II, and this has many 
observers wondering whether a recession is imminent. Clearly the power struggle between China and the United States 
over trade has given cause for concern. The longer that this climate of uncertainty persists, the greater the likelihood 
that business leaders will delay investment and hiring plans as they wait for more clarity on the new rules of the game. 
Activity in the global manufacturing sector slowed significantly in 2019 but, fortunately, the service sector continued to 
perform well. Some emerging countries are particularly vulnerable to rising protectionism, given the important role 
played by the manufacturing sector in their economies. In addition, in recent years, U.S.-dollar debt levels in certain 
countries have risen sharply, and an appreciation of the U.S. dollar could compromise the creditworthiness of certain 
borrowers. In Europe, geopolitical risks are abound, including the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the 
European Union without an agreement, political uncertainty in Italy, and a potential resurgence of the yellow vest 
movement in France.  
Given the exceptional monetary measures taken by central banks combined with mild economic growth and low inflation, 
long-term interest rates have remained low for a long time in the advanced economies. Such a situation may have 
prompted market participants to adopt excessive risk-taking strategies in search of higher returns, which may have 
adverse effects should the economy falter or interest rates rise. Therefore, the Bank is remaining vigilant and continuing 
to rely on its strong risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate risk and to remain within the risk 
appetite limits. 
The Canadian economy is showing encouraging signs in a gloomy global economic environment. The labour market has 
EEccoonnoommiicc   been resilient despite disappointing economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019. A 
aanndd   strong rebound in the second quarter confirmed that this weakness was only temporary, particularly in the energy sector. 
ggeeooppoolliittiiccaall  
In the wake of the sharp drop in oil prices in 2014-2015, producers have adapted to the new environment, but if oil and 
rriisskk  
gas prices were to fall even further, producers would face obstacles that would affect their repayment capacity and credit 
quality. The fossil fuel-producing provinces continue to idle and their unemployment rates remain high. Sound economic 
and financial conditions in the three largest provinces (Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia) continue, however, to 
support a credit environment favourable to the loan portfolios. Still, Canada remains vulnerable to a deteriorating global 
economic backdrop, which threatens to erode job creation and disposable household income—even more so given high 
debt levels. While the Vancouver and Toronto real estate markets are showing some stability after a slowdown, they 
remain vulnerable to a less favourable economic environment due to high prices. An unexpected jump in inflation also 
represents a risk to the Canadian economy to the extent that it could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of 
Canada to scale back its monetary accommodation. Should this occur, real estate assets, among others, would be 
vulnerable to a price correction.  
The Bank monitors international developments that may affect the Canadian economy. Even though Canada has reached 
a trade agreement with its North American partners, American protectionism continues to pose a risk to Canada. For 
example, the U.S. administration did not hesitate to threaten Mexico with tariffs during the migrant dispute, even though 
a trade agreement had just been reached. In addition, the current Chinese-American conflict may gradually lead to the 
development of two quite separate supply chains. Should this occur, Canadian companies that choose to focus on the 
U.S. market may be denied access to the Chinese market, while those that choose the Chinese market may have more 
difficulty gaining market share in the United States. These uncertainties may significantly destabilize certain sectors, 
and the Bank has responded by continuing to monitor market developments and remaining vigilant in line with its risk 
tolerance policy.

The Bank is reliant on technology, as clients are seeking greater access to products and services on a variety of platforms 
that must support substantial data volumes. The fast pace of technological change combined with both client and 
competitive pressures require significant and sustained investment in technology. Inadequate implementation of 
technological improvements or new products or services could significantly affect the Bank’s ability to serve and retain 
clients.  
Third parties provide essential components of the Bank’s technological infrastructure such as Internet connections and 
RReelliiaannccee  oonn   access to network and other communications services. The Bank also relies on the services of third parties to support

framework wherein information security, financial health, and performance are validated before any agreements are 
reached and throughout the life of the agreements. It also includes business continuity plans, which are tested 
periodically to ensure their effectiveness in times of crisis. Despite these preventive measures and the efforts deployed 
by the Bank’s teams to manage third parties, there remains a possibility that certain risks will materialize. In such cases, 
the Bank would then rely on the contingency and mitigation measures established in collaboration with the third parties. 
The Bank is aware of the significance of third-party-related risks and continues to develop its practices in this regard. 
In recent years, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) approach has not been a major concern for customers 
and investors. Today, perceptions have changed, and many stakeholders now agree that these issues have become a 
current concern and could affect corporate profitability in the near future. The Bank has therefore adopted ESG principles 
and supported a variety of sustainable development initiatives.   
The increased focus on ESG issues has not been prompted by any specific laws or regulations requiring greater 
disclosure but rather by a desire for transparency and a broader understanding of their impact on corporate reputation 
EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttaall,,   and finances. Pressures from customers, investors, environmental groups and, more recently, non-financial bodies have

Considerable change is occurring in terms of commitment to and implementation of such frameworks and guides.   
In addition, the Bank of Canada’s annual Financial System Review addressed issues such as the interrelationships 
between the environment, the economy, and the financial system. This is particularly true in Canada, where resources 
play a vital role in our economy and where the natural environment is a defining feature of our identity.  Although no 
specific requirements have been published, we will continue to closely monitor developments in this area and all their 
implications for the Bank. 
The Bank’s financial performance depends on its ability to develop and market new and innovative products and services, 
adopt and develop new technologies that help differentiate its products and services and generate cost savings, and 
market these new products and services at the right time and at competitive prices. Failure to properly review critical 
changes within the business before and during the implementation and deployment of key technological systems or

In addition, the level of competition in the Bank’s markets has an impact on its performance. Retaining clients hinges on 
several factors, including the prices of products and services, quality of service, and changes to the products and services 
offered.

International Risks 
Through the operations of some of its units (mainly its New York and London offices) and subsidiaries in Canada and abroad (in particular, Credigy Ltd., NBC 
Global Finance Limited, and Advanced Bank of Asia Limited), the Bank is exposed to risks arising from its presence in international markets and foreign 
jurisdictions. While these risks do not affect a significant proportion of the Bank’s portfolios, their impact must not be overlooked, especially those that are of a 
legal or regulatory nature. Such risk can be particularly high when the exposure is in a territory where the enforceability of agreements signed by the Bank is 
uncertain, in countries and regions facing political or socio-economic disturbances, or in countries that may be subject to international sanctions. Generally 
speaking, there are many ways in which the Bank may be exposed to the risks posed by other countries, not the least of which being foreign laws and regulations. 
In all such situations, it is important to consider what is referred to as “country risk.” Country risk affects not only the activities that the Bank carries out abroad 
but also the business that it conducts with non-resident clients as well as the services it provides to clients doing business abroad, such as electronic funds 
transfers, international products and transactions from Canada in foreign currencies.  
As part of its activities, the Bank must adhere to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) regulatory requirements in effect in each 
jurisdiction where it conducts business. It must also comply with the requirements pertaining to current international sanctions in these various jurisdictions. 
Money laundering and terrorist financing is a financial, regulatory and reputation risk. For additional information, see the Regulatory Compliance Risk 
Management section. 
The Bank is exposed to financial risks outside Canada and the United States primarily through its interbank transactions on international financial markets or 
through international trade finance activities. This geographic exposure represents a moderate proportion of the Bank’s total risk. The geographic exposure of 
loans is disclosed in the quarterly Supplementary Financial Information report available on the Bank’s website at nbc.ca. To control country risk, the Bank sets 
credit concentration limits by country and reviews and submits them to the Board for approval upon renewal of the Credit Risk Management Policy. These limits 
are based on a percentage of the Bank’s regulatory capital, in line with the level of risk represented by each country, particularly emerging countries. The risk is 
rated using a classification mechanism similar to the one used for credit default risk. In addition to the country limits, authorization caps and limits are 
established, as a percentage of capital, for the world’s high-risk regions, i.e., essentially all regions except for North America, Western European countries and 
the developed countries of Asia. 
Acquisitions 
The Bank’s ability to successfully complete an acquisition is often conditional on regulatory approval, and the Bank cannot be certain of the timing or conditions 
of regulatory decisions. Acquisitions could affect future results should the Bank experience difficulty integrating the acquired business. If the Bank does 
encounter difficulty integrating an acquired business, maintaining an appropriate governance level over the acquired business, or retaining key officers within 
the acquired business, these factors could prevent the Bank from realizing expected revenue growth, cost savings, market share gains and other projected 
benefits of the acquisition.  
Intellectual Property  
The Bank protects the intellectual property developed by its employees in connection with their duties. However, in some cases, it may have a more limited 
ability to acquire intellectual property rights. Moreover, the intellectual property rights acquired by the Bank provide no guarantees that they will be effective in 
deterring or preventing a third party from misappropriating intellectual property or providing a defense against the misappropriation of intellectual property. 
Moreover, the goods and services developed by the Bank are provided in a competitive market where third parties could hold intellectual property rights prior 
to those held by the Bank. In such circumstances, there is no guarantee that the Bank will successfully provide a defense against an infringement claim, that it 
will be able to modify its goods and services to avoid infringing upon third party rights or that it will obtain a licence with commercially acceptable conditions. 
Ability to Attract and Retain Key Officers 
The Bank’s future performance depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key officers. There is intense competition for the best people in the financial 
services industry, and there is no assurance that the Bank, or any entity it acquires, will be able to continue to attract and retain key officers. 
Judicial and Regulatory Proceedings  
The Bank takes reasonable measures to comply with the laws and regulations in effect in the jurisdictions where it operates. Should these measures prove 
ineffective, the Bank could be subject to judicial or regulatory decisions resulting in fines, damages, or other costs or to restrictions likely to adversely affect its 
operating results or its reputation. The Bank may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Although the Bank establishes provisions for the 
measures it is subject to under accounting requirements, actual losses resulting from such litigation could differ significantly from the recognized amounts, and 
unfavourable outcomes in such cases could have a significant adverse effect on the Bank’s operating results. The resulting reputational damage could also affect 
the Bank’s future business prospects. For additional information, see Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.

Risk Management 
Accounting Policies, Methods and Estimates Used by the Bank 
The accounting policies and methods used by the Bank determine how the Bank reports its financial position and operating results and require management to 
make estimates or rely on assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Any changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant 
impact on the Bank’s operating results and financial position.  
Other Factors 
Other factors that could affect the Bank’s future results include amendments to tax legislation, unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits, 
the timely development and launch of new products and services, the ability to successfully align its organizational structure, resources and processes, the 
ability to activate a business continuity plan within a reasonable time, the potential impact of international conflicts or natural catastrophes on the Bank’s 
activities, and the Bank’s ability to foresee and effectively manage the risks associated with these factors through rigorous risk management. 
CCrreeddiitt  RRiisskk    
Credit risk is the risk of incurring a financial loss if an obligor does not fully honour its contractual commitments to the Bank. Obligors may be debtors, issuers, 
counterparties or guarantors. Credit risk is the most significant risk facing the Bank in the normal course of business. The Bank is exposed to credit risk not only 
through its direct lending activities and transactions but also through commitments to extend credit, letters of guarantee, letters of credit, over-the-counter 
derivatives trading, debt securities, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, deposits with financial institutions, brokerage activities, and 
transactions carrying a settlement risk for the Bank such as irrevocable fund transfers to third parties via electronic payment systems. 
GGoovveerrnnaannccee  
A policy framework centralizes the governance of activities that generate credit risk for the Bank and is supplemented by a series of subordinate internal policies 
and standards. These policies and standards address specific management issues such as credit limits, collateral requirements and risk quantification or issues 
that provide more thorough guidance for given business segments.  
For example, the institutional activities of the Bank and its subsidiaries on financial markets and international commercial transactions are governed by business 
unit directives that set out standards adapted to the specific environment of these activities. This also applies to retail brokerage subsidiaries. In isolated cases, 
a business unit or subsidiary may have its own credit policy, and that policy must always fall within the spirit of the Bank’s policy framework and be reviewed 
and approved by the management of the Risk Management Group. The Risk Management Group defines the scope of the universe of subsidiaries carrying 
significant credit risks and the magnitude of the risks incurred.  
Credit risk is controlled through a rigorous process that comprises the following elements: 
• credit risk rating and assessment;
• economic capital assessment;
• stress testing and crisis scenarios;
• credit granting process; 
• revision and renewal process;
• risk mitigation;
• follow-up of monitored accounts and recovery; 
• counterparty risk assessment;
• settlement risk assessment.
Reporting 
Every quarter, an integrated risk management report is presented to senior management and the RMC. It presents changes in the credit portfolio and highlights 
on the following matters:  
• credit portfolio volume growth by business segment;
• a breakdown of the credit portfolio according to various criteria for which concentration limits have been set; 
• changes in allowances for credit losses; 
• changes in impaired loans; 
• follow-up of monitored accounts.

Before a sound and prudent credit decision can be made, the obligor’s or counterparty’s credit risk must be accurately assessed. This is the first step in 
processing credit applications. Each application is analyzed and assigned one of 19 grades on a scale of 1 to 10 using a credit rating system developed by the 
Bank for all portfolios exposed to credit risk. As each grade corresponds to a debtor’s, counterparty’s or third party’s probability of default, the Bank can estimate 
the credit risk. The credit risk assessment method varies according to portfolio type. There are two main methods for assessing credit risk, i.e., the Advanced 
Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) Approach and the Standardized Approach, as defined by the Basel Accord to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements 
for most of its portfolios. 
 
The main parameters used to measure the credit risk of loans outstanding and undrawn amounts under the AIRB Approach are as follows: 
 
•  probability of default (PD), which is the probability of through-the-cycle 12-month default by the obligor, calibrated on a long-run average PD throughout a 
full economic cycle; 
•  loss given default (LGD), which represents the magnitude of the loss from the obligor’s default that would be expected in an economic downturn and subject 
to certain regulatory floors, expressed as a percentage of exposure at default; 
•  exposure at default (EAD), which is an estimate of the amount drawn and of the expected use of any undrawn portion prior to default, and cannot be lower 
than the current balance.  
 
The methodology as well as the data and the downturn periods used to estimate LGD are described below.

Personal Credit Portfolios 
This category comprises portfolios of residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and loans to certain small businesses. To assess credit risk, AIRB models are 
in place for the main portfolios, particularly mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, budget loans and lines of credit. A risk analysis based on 
loan grouping in pools of homogeneous obligor and product profiles is used for overall management of personal credit portfolios. This personal credit 
assessment approach, which has proven particularly effective for estimating credit defaults and losses, takes a number of factors into account, namely:  
 
•  behaviour scoring; 
•  loan product characteristics; 
•  collateral provided; 
•  the length of time on the Bank’s balance sheet;  
•  loan status (active, delinquent or defaulted).  
 
This mechanism provides adequate risk measurement inasmuch as it effectively differentiates risk levels by pool. Therefore, the results are periodically reviewed 
and, if necessary, adjustments are made to the models. Obligor migrations between pools are among the factors considered in the credit risk assessment.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis   
Risk Management   
 
  
Loan pools are also established based on PD, LGD, and EAD, which are measured based on the characteristics of the obligor and the transaction itself. The credit 
risk of these portfolios is estimated using credit scoring models that determine the obligor’s PD. LGD is estimated based on transaction-specific factors such as 
loan product characteristics (for example, a line of credit versus a term loan), loan-to-value ratio and types of collateral.  
 
Under the Bank’s standards applicable to default-risk rating and facility-risk rating and according to its risk review, renewal and quantification standards, default 
risk ratings must be reviewed annually.  
 
Credit scoring models are also used to grant credit. These models use proven statistical methods that measure applicants’ demand characteristics and history 
based on internal and external historical information to estimate the applicant’s future credit behaviour and assign a probability of default. The underlying data 
include client information such as current and past employment, historical loan data in the Bank’s management systems and information from external sources 
such as credit rating agencies.  
 
The Bank also uses behaviour scoring models to manage and monitor current commitments. The risk assessment is based on statistical analyses of the past 
behaviour of obligors with which the Bank has a long-term relationship in an effort to predict their future behaviour. The underlying information includes the 
obligor’s cash flows and borrowing trends. Information on characteristics that determine behaviour in these models also comes from both internal sources on 
current commitments and external sources. The table below shows the PD categories along with the associated credit qualities of the personal credit portfolio. 
  
Business and Government Credit Portfolios 
This category comprises business (other than some small businesses that are classified in personal credit portfolios), government and financial institution credit 
portfolios. 
 
These credit portfolios are assigned a risk rating based on a detailed individual analysis of the financial and non-financial aspects of the obligor, including the 
obligor’s financial strength, sector of economic activity, competitive ability, access to capital and management quality. The Bank has risk-rating tools and models 
enabling it to specifically assess the risk represented by an obligor in relation to its industry and peers. The models used are adapted to the obligor’s broad 
sector of activity. Models are in place for ten sectors: business/commercial, large business, financial institutions, sovereigns, investment funds, energy, real 
estate, agriculture, insurance, and public-private partnership project financing. 
 
This risk assessment method assigns a default risk rating to an obligor that reflects its credit quality. To each default credit risk rating corresponds a PD (see the 
following table). Using this classification of obligor credit risk, the Bank can differentiate appropriately between the various assessments of an obligor’s capacity 
to meet its contractual obligations. Default risk ratings are assigned according to an assessment of an obligor’s commercial and financial risks based on a 
solvency review. Various risk quantification models, described below, are used to perform this assessment. 
 
The business and government default risk rating scale used by the Bank is similar to the systems used by major external rating agencies. The following table 
presents a grouping of the ratings by major risk category and compares them with the ratings of two major rating agencies.

The Bank also uses individual assessment models by industry to assign a risk rating to the credit facility based on the collateral and guarantees the obligor is 
able to provide and, in some cases, based on other factors. The Bank consequently has a bi-dimensional risk-rating system that, using models and based on 
internal and external historical data, establishes a default risk rating for each obligor. In addition, the models assign, to each credit facility, an LGD risk rating 
that is independent of the default risk rating assigned to the obligor.

The Bank’s default risk ratings and LGD risk ratings as well as the related risk parameters contribute directly to informed credit-granting, renewal and monitoring 
decisions. They are also used to determine and analyze risk-based pricing. In addition, from a credit portfolio management perspective, they are used to establish 
counterparty credit concentration limits and segment concentration limits and to determine the credit risk appetite of these portfolios. Moreover, they represent 
an important component in estimating expected and unexpected losses, measuring minimum required economic capital, and measuring the minimum level of 
capital required, as prescribed by the regulatory authorities. 
 
The credit risk of obligors and of their facilities is assessed with the PD and LGD parameters at least once a year or more often if significant changes (triggers) 
are observed when updating financial information or if another qualitative indicator of a deterioration in the obligor’s solvency or in the collateral associated 
with the obligor’s facilities is noted. A watchlist also exists that enables the Bank to more actively monitor the financial position of obligors whose default-risk 
rating is greater than or equal to 7.0. This process seeks to minimize an obligor’s default risk and allows for proactive credit risk management. 
 
Validation 
The Risk Management Group monitors the effectiveness of the risk-rating systems and associated parameters, which are also reviewed regularly in accordance 
with the Bank’s policies.  
 
Backtesting is performed at regular intervals to validate the effectiveness of the models used to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. For PD in particular, this backtesting 
takes the form of sequentially applied statistical tests designed to assess the following criteria: 
 
•  the model’s discriminatory power; 
•  overrides; 
•  model calibration;  
•  the stability of the model’s output. 
 
The credit risk quantification models are developed and tested by a team of specialists and their performance is monitored by the applicable business units and 
related credit risk management services. Models are validated by a unit that is independent of both the specialists who developed the model and the concerned 
business units. Approvals of new models or changes to existing models are subject to an escalation process established by the model risk management policy. 
Furthermore, new models or changes to existing models that markedly impact regulatory capital must be approved by the Board before being submitted to the 
regulatory agencies, and a summary report of all changes to the models is submitted to the RMC once a year.  
 
The facility and default risk-rating systems, methods and models are also subject to periodic independent validation as often as required given the inherent risk 
of the activity. Models that have a significant impact on regulatory capital must be reviewed regularly, thereby further raising the certainty that these 
quantification mechanisms are working as expected.  
 
The key aspects to be validated are factors allowing accurate risk classification by level, adequate quantification of exposure, use of assessment techniques that 
include external factors such as economic conditions and credit status and, lastly, compliance with internal policies and regulatory provisions. Each year, the 
Risk Management Group presents a summary report on the validations to the RMC. 
 
The Bank’s credit risk assessment and rating systems are overseen by the Models Oversight Committee, the GRC and the RMC, and are an integral part of a 
comprehensive Bank-wide credit risk oversight framework. Along with the above-mentioned elements, the Bank documents and periodically reviews the policies, 
definitions of responsibilities, resource allocation and existing processes. 
  
AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  EEccoonnoommiicc  CCaappiittaall  
The assessment of the Bank’s minimum required economic capital is based on the credit risk assessments of debtors. These two activities are therefore 
interlinked. The different models used to assess the credit risk of a given portfolio type also enable the Bank to determine the default correlation among debtors. 
This information is a critical component in the evaluation of potential losses for all portfolios carrying credit risk. Estimates of potential losses, whether expected 
or not, are based on historical loss experience, portfolio monitoring, market data and statistical modelling. Expected and unexpected losses are factors used in 
assessing the minimum required economic capital for all of the Bank’s credit portfolios. The assessment of economic capital also considers the anticipated 
potential migrations of obligors’ default risk during the remaining term of their credit commitments. The main risk factors that have an impact on economic 
capital are as follows: 
 
•  the obligor’s PD; 
•  EAD;  
•  LGD; 
•  the PD correlation among obligors; 
•  the residual term of credit commitments;  
•  the impact of economic and sector-based cycles on asset quality.

The Bank carries out stress tests to evaluate its sensitivity to crisis situations in certain activity sectors and key portfolios. A global stress test methodology 
covers most business, government, and personal credit portfolios to provide the Bank with an overview of the situation. By simulating specific scenarios, these 
tests enable the Bank to measure the level of regulatory capital needed to absorb potential losses and to determine the impact on its solvency. In addition, these 
tests contribute to portfolio management as they influence the determination of concentration limits by obligor, product or business sector.  
 
Mortgage Loan Underwriting 
To mitigate the impact of an economic slowdown and ensure the long-term quality of its portfolio, the Bank uses sound risk management when granting 
residential mortgages to confirm: (i) the obligor’s intention to meet its financial obligations, (ii) the obligor’s ability to repay its debts and (iii) the quality of the 
collateral. In addition, in accordance with the applicable rules, the Bank takes a prudent approach to client qualification by using, for example, a higher interest 
rate to mitigate the risk of short- or medium-term rate increases. 
 
Nonetheless, the risk of economic slowdown could adversely affect the profitability of the mortgage portfolio. In stress test analyses, the Bank considers a variety 
of scenarios to measure the impact of adverse market conditions. In such circumstances, our analyses show significantly higher credit losses, which would 
decrease profitability and reduce the Bank’s capital ratios. 
 
CCrreeddiitt--GGrraannttiinngg  PPrroocceessss  
Credit-granting decisions are based first and foremost on the results of the risk assessment. Aside from a client’s solvency, credit-granting decisions are also 
influenced by factors such as available collateral, transaction compliance with policies, standards and procedures, and the Bank’s overall risk-adjusted return 
objective. Each credit-granting decision is made by authorities within the risk management teams and management who are independent of the business units 
and are at a reporting level commensurate with the size of the proposed credit transaction and the associated risk. 
 
Decision-making authority is determined in compliance with the delegation of authority set out in the Credit Risk Management Policy. A person in a senior 
position in the organization approves credit facilities that are substantial or carry a higher risk for the Bank. The GRC approves and monitors all substantial credit 
facilities. Credit applications that exceed management’s latitudes are submitted to the Board for approval. The credit-granting process demands a high level of 
accountability from managers, who must proactively manage the credit portfolio.

The Bank periodically reviews credit files. The review process enables the Bank to update information on the quality of the facilities and covers, among other 
things, risk ratings, compliance with credit conditions, and obligor behaviour. The credit risk of all obligors is reviewed at least once per year. After this periodic 
review, for on-demand or unused credit, the Bank decides whether to pursue its business relationship with the obligor and, if so, revises the credit conditions. 
  
RRiisskk  MMiittiiggaattiioonn  
The Bank also controls credit risk using various risk mitigation techniques. In addition to the standard practice of requiring collateral to guarantee repayment of 
the credit it grants, the Bank also uses protection mechanisms such as credit derivative financial instruments, syndication and loan assignments as well as an 
orderly reduction in the amount of credit granted. 
 
The most common method used to mitigate credit risk is to obtain quality collateral from obligors. Obtaining collateral cannot replace a rigorous assessment of 
an obligor’s ability to meet its financial obligations, but, beyond a certain risk threshold, it is an essential complement. Collateral is not required in all cases. It 
depends upon the level of risk presented by the obligor and the type of loan granted. However, if the level of risk to the Bank is considered high, collateral will 
likely be required. The legal validity and enforceability of any collateral obtained and the Bank’s ability to correctly and regularly measure the collateral’s value 
are critical for this mechanism to play its proper role in risk mitigation.  
 
The Bank has established specific requirements in its internal policies with respect to the appropriate legal documentation and assessment for the kinds of 
collateral that business units may require to guarantee the loans granted. The categories of eligible collateral and the lending value of the collateralized assets 
have also been defined by the Bank. For the most part, they include the following asset categories as well as guarantees (whether secured by collateral or 
unsecured) and government and bank guarantees: 
 
•  accounts receivable; 
•  inventories; 
•  machinery and equipment and rolling stock; 
•  residential and commercial real estate, office buildings and industrial facilities;  
•  cash and marketable securities. 
 
Portfolio Diversification and Management 
The Bank is exposed to credit risk, not only through outstanding loans and undrawn amounts of commitments to a particular obligor but also through the sectoral 
distribution of the outstanding loans and undrawn amounts and through the exposure of its various credit portfolios to geographical, concentration and 
settlement risks.

The Bank’s approach to controlling these diverse risks begins with a diversification of exposures. Measures designed to maintain a healthy degree of 
diversification of credit risk in its portfolios are set out in the Bank’s policies, standards and procedures. These instructions are mainly reflected in the application 
of various exposure limits: credit concentration limits by counterparty and credit concentration limits by business sector, country, region, product, and type of 
financial instrument. These limits are determined based on the Bank’s credit risk appetite framework and are reviewed periodically. Compliance with these limits, 
particularly exceptions, is monitored through periodic reports submitted by the Risk Management Group’s officers to the Board. 
 
Continuous analyses are performed in order to anticipate problems with a sector or obligor before they materialize as defaulted payments. 
 
Other Risk Mitigation Methods 
Credit risk mitigation measures for transactions in derivative financial instruments, which are regularly used by the Bank, are described in detail in the 
Counterparty Risk section. 
 
Credit Derivative Financial Instruments and Financial Guarantee Contracts 
The Bank also reduces credit risk by using the protection provided by credit derivative financial instruments such as credit default swaps. When the Bank acquires 
credit protection, it pays a premium on the swap to the counterparty in exchange for the counterparty’s commitment to pay if the underlying entity defaults or 
another event involving the underlying entity and covered by the legal agreement occurs. Since, like obligors, providers of credit protection must receive a default 
risk rating, the Bank’s standards set out all the criteria under which a counterparty may be judged eligible to mitigate the Bank’s credit risk. The Bank may also 
reduce its credit risk by entering into financial guarantee contracts whereby a guarantor indemnifies the Bank for a loss resulting from an obligor failing to make 
a payment when due in accordance with the contractual terms of a debt instrument. 
 
Loan Syndication 
The Bank has developed specific instructions on the appropriate objectives, responsibilities and documentation requirements for loan syndication.

Credit granted and obligors are monitored on an ongoing basis and in a manner commensurate with the related risk. Loan portfolio managers use an array of 
intervention methods to conduct a particularly rigorous follow-up on files that show a high risk of default. When loans continue to deteriorate and there is an 
increase in risk to the point where monitoring has to be increased, a group specialized in managing problem accounts steps in to maximize collection of the 
disbursed amounts and tailor strategies to these accounts. 
 
In these cases, loan portfolio managers prepare and submit, to the credit department, a detailed monitoring report (watchlist) each month to track the status of 
at-risk obligors and the corrective measures undertaken. The management of each department concerned performs follow-ups on the reports, and each quarter 
a credit monitoring committee meets to review the action plans and monitoring reports of obligors that have commitments of $3 million or more. The authority 
to approve allowances for credit losses is attributed using limits delegated on the basis of hierarchical level under the Credit Risk Management Policy. 
 
Information on the recognition of impaired loans and allowances for credit losses is presented in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 
  
Forbearance and Restructuring  
Situations where a business or retail obligor begin showing clear signs of potential insolvency are managed on a case-by-case basis and require the use of 
judgment. The Loan Work Out Policy sets out the principles applicable in such situations to guide loan restructuring decisions and identify situations where 
distressed restructuring applies. A distressed restructuring situation occurs when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the obligor’s financial 
difficulties, grants the obligor a special concession that is contrary to the Bank's policies. Such concessions could include a lower interest rate, waiver of principal 
and extension of the maturity date. 
 
The Bank has established a management framework for commercial and corporate obligors that represent higher-than-normal risk of default. It outlines the roles 
and responsibilities of loan portfolio managers with respect to managing high-risk accounts and the responsibilities of the Work Out units and other participants 
in the process. Lastly, the Credit Risk Management Policy and a management framework are used to determine the authorization limits for distressed 
restructuring situations. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the amount of distressed loan restructurings was not significant.

Counterparty risk is a credit risk that the Bank incurs on various types of transactions involving financial instruments. The most significant risks are those it faces 
when it trades derivative financial instruments with counterparties on the over-the-counter market or when it purchases securities under reverse repurchase 
agreements or sells securities under repurchase agreements. Securities lending transactions and securities brokerage activities involving derivative financial 
instruments are also sources of counterparty risk. Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides a complete description of the credit risk for derivative 
financial instruments by type of traded product.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis   
Risk Management   
 
  
The Risk Management Group has developed models by broad category of financial instrument through which it applies an advanced methodology for calculating 
the Bank’s credit risk exposure and economic capital. The exposures are subject to limits. These two elements are established based on the potential volatility 
of the underlying assets until expiration of the contract.  
 
Counterparty obligations related to the trading of contracts on derivative financial instruments, securities lending transactions and reverse repurchase 
agreements are frequently subject to credit risk mitigation measures. The mitigation techniques are somewhat different from those used for loans and advances 
and depend on the nature of the instrument or the type of contract traded. The most widely used measure is the signing of master agreements: the International 
Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master agreement, the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) and the Global Master Securities Lending 
Agreement (GMSLA). These agreements make it possible, in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of one of the contracting parties, to apply full netting 
of the gross amounts of the market values for each of the transactions covered by the agreement in force at the time of default. The amount of the final settlement 
is therefore the net balance of gains and losses on each transaction, which reduces exposure when a counterparty defaults. The Bank’s policies require that an 
ISDA, GMRA, or GMSLA agreement be signed with most trading counterparties to derivatives, foreign exchange forward contracts, securities lending transactions 
and reverse repurchase agreements. 
 
Another mechanism for reducing credit risk on derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts complements the ISDA master agreement in many cases and 
provides the Bank and its counterparty (or either of the parties, if need be) with the right to request collateral from the counterparty when the net balance of 
gains and losses on each transaction exceeds a threshold defined in the agreement. These agreements, also known as Credit Support Annexes (CSAs), are 
common between financial institutions active in international financial markets since they limit credit risk while providing traders with additional flexibility to 
continue trading with the counterparty. The Bank often uses this type of legal documentation in transactions with financial institutions and governments. For 
business transactions, the Bank prefers to use internal mechanisms set out in the credit agreements. The Bank’s internal policies set the conditions governing 
the implementation of such mitigation methods.   
 
Requiring collateral as part of a securities lending transaction or reverse repurchase agreement is not solely the result of an internal credit decision. In fact, it is 
a mandatory market practice imposed by self-regulating organizations in the financial services sector such as the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization 
of Canada.  
 
The Bank also has policies and guidelines governing its own collateral pledged to counterparties, given the potential impact of such asset transfers on its 
liquidity. In accordance with its Liquidity, Funding & Pledging Policy, the Bank conducts simulations of potential counterparty collateral claims under the CSAs 
in effect in the event of a Bank downgrade or other unlikely occurrences. The simulations are based on various Bank downgrading scenarios or market value 
fluctuations of transactions covered by CSAs. 
 
The Bank has identified circumstances in which it is likely to be exposed to wrong-way risk, which is generally associated with exposure to counterparty risk and 
characterized by higher risk for the Bank if a counterparty’s PD increases (unfavourable positive correlation). A common wrong-way risk arises from the trading 
of derivatives contracts with counterparties where the underlying assets may include equity securities issued by those counterparties. 
  
AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSeettttlleemmeenntt  RRiisskk  
Settlement risk potentially arises from transactions that feature reciprocal delivery of cash or securities between the Bank and a counterparty. Foreign exchange 
contracts are an example of transactions that can generate significant levels of settlement risk. However, the implementation of multilateral settlement systems 
that allow settlement netting among participating institutions has contributed greatly to reducing the risks associated with the settlement of foreign exchange 
transactions among banks. The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to gain access to established clearing houses in order to minimize settlement risk for 
certain financial derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank may have direct access to established clearing houses for settling financial transactions such 
as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. In addition, certain derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or 
indirectly by central counterparties. For additional information, see the table that presents notional amounts in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
There are several other types of transactions that may generate settlement risk, in particular the use of certain electronic fund transfer services. This risk refers 
to the possibility that the Bank may make a payment or settlement on a transaction without receiving the amount owed by the counterparty, and with no 
opportunity to recover the funds delivered (irrevocable settlement). 
 
The ultimate means for completely eliminating such a risk is for the Bank to complete no payments or settlements before receiving the funds due from the 
counterparty. Such an approach cannot, however, be used systematically. For several electronic payment services, the Bank is able to implement mechanisms 
that allow it to make its transfers revocable or to debit the counterparty in the amount of the settlements before it makes its own transfer. On the other hand, the 
nature of transactions in financial instruments makes it impossible for such practices to be widely used. For example, on foreign exchange transactions involving 
a currency other than the U.S. dollar, time zone differentials impose strict payment schedules on the parties. The Bank cannot unduly postpone a settlement 
without facing significant penalties, due to the large size of amounts involved.  
 
The most effective way for the Bank to control settlement risks, both for financial market transactions and irrevocable transfers, is to impose internal risk limits 
based on the counterparty’s ability to pay.

Market risk is the risk of losses arising from movements in market prices. Market risk comes from a number of factors, particularly changes to market variables 
such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and implied volatilities. The Bank is exposed to market risk through its participation in 
trading, investment and asset/liability management activities. Trading activities involve taking positions, particularly on various instruments such as bonds, 
shares, currencies, commodities or derivative financial instruments. The Bank is exposed to non-trading market risk through its asset/liability management and 
investment portfolios. 
  
The trading portfolios include positions in financial instruments and commodities held either with trading intent or to hedge other elements of the trading book. 
Positions held with trading intent are those held for short-term resale and/or with the intent of taking advantage of actual or expected short-term price 
movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. These portfolios target one of the following objectives: market making, liquidating positions for clients or selling 
financial products to clients.  
 
Non-trading portfolios include financial instruments intended to be held to maturity as well as those held for daily cash management or for the purpose of 
maintaining targeted returns or ensuring asset and liability management.  
 
GGoovveerrnnaannccee  
A market risk management policy governs global market risk management across the Bank’s units and subsidiaries that are exposed to this type of risk. It is 
approved by the GRC. The policy sets out the framework and principles for managing market risk; defines risk measures, control and monitoring activities; sets 
limits; and reports on breaches. 
 
The Financial Markets Risk Committee oversees all Financial Markets segment risks that could adversely affect the Bank's results, liquidity, or capital. This 
committee also oversees the Financial Markets segment’s risk framework to ensure that controls are in place to contain risk in accordance with the Bank's risk 
appetite framework.  
  
Market risk limits ensure the link and coherence between the Bank’s market risk appetite targets and the day-to-day market risk management by all parties 
involved, notably senior management, business lines and market risk sector in its independent control function. The Bank's monitoring and reporting process 
consists of comparing market risk exposure to alert levels and market risk limits determined for all limit authorization and approval levels. 
  
AAsssseessssiinngg  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk  
The Risk Management Group uses a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses under more or less severe scenarios, and using both short-
term and long-term time horizons. For short-term horizons, the Bank’s risk measures include Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR), and sensitivity metrics. 
For long-term horizons or sudden significant market moves, including those due to a lack of market liquidity, the risk measures include stress testing across an 
extensive range of scenarios.  
 
VaR and SVaR Models 
VaR is a statistical measure of risk that is used to quantify market risks by product and by risk type as well as aggregate risk by portfolio, for the Bank as a whole. 
VaR is defined as the maximum loss at a specific confidence level over a certain horizon under normal market conditions. The VaR method has the advantage of 
providing a uniform measurement of financial instrument-related market risks based on a single statistical confidence level and time horizon.  
 
For VaR, the Bank uses a historical price distribution to compute the probable loss levels at the 99% confidence level, using a two-year history of daily time series 
of risk factor changes. VaR is the maximum daily loss the Bank could incur, in 99 cases out of 100, in a given portfolio. In other words, the loss could exceed that 
amount in only one out of 100 cases.   
 
The trading VaR is measured by assuming a holding period of one day for ongoing market risk management and a 10-day holding period for regulatory capital 
purposes. VaR is calculated on a daily basis both for major classes of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) and all trading portfolios 
in the Financial Markets segment and the Bank's Global Funding and Treasury Group.  
 
In addition to the one-day trading VaR, the Bank calculates a trading SVaR, which is a statistical measure of risk that replicates the VaR calculation method but 
uses, instead of a two-year history of risk factor changes, a 12-month data period corresponding to a continuous period of significant financial stress that is 
relevant in terms of the Bank’s portfolios.

Risk Management   
 
  
VaR methodology techniques are well suited to measure risks under normal market conditions. VaR metrics are most appropriate as a risk measure for trading 
positions in liquid financial markets. However, there are limitations in measuring risks with this method when extreme and sudden market risk events occur, 
since they are likely to underestimate the Bank’s market risk. VaR methodology limitations include the following: 
 
  past changes in market risk factors may not always produce accurate predictions of the distribution and correlations of future market movements; 
  a VaR with a daily time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; 
  the market risk factor historical database used for VaR calculation may not reflect potential losses that could occur under unusual market conditions (e.g., 
periods of extreme illiquidity) relative to the historical period used for VaR estimates; 
  the use of a 99% VaR confidence level does not reflect the extent of potential losses beyond that percentile. 
 
Given the limitations of VaR, for the Bank it represents only one component in its risk management oversight, which also incorporates, among other measures, 
stress testing, sensitivity analysis, concentration and liquidity limits and analysis.  
 
The Bank also conducts backtesting of the VaR model. It consists of comparing the profits and losses to the statistical VaR measure. Backtesting is essential to 
verifying the VaR model’s capacity to adequately forecast the maximum risk of market losses and thus validate, retroactively, the quality and accuracy of the 
results obtained using the model. If the backtesting results present material discrepancies, the VaR model could be revised in accordance with the Bank’s model 
risk management framework. 
 
CCoonnttrroolllliinngg  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk  
Outstanding VaR exposure is monitored daily in relation to established limits for each type of market risk, portfolio and business unit. The RMC reviews VaR 
results and other risk measure results each quarter, including any breaches of the limits set out in the policy.  
 
The Bank also uses economic capital for market risk as an indicator for risk appetite and limits setting. This indicator measures the amount of capital that is 
required to absorb unexpected losses due to market risk events over a one-year horizon and with a determined confidence level. For additional information on 
economic capital, see the Capital Management section of this MD&A.

A crisis scenario is a risk management technique that consists of estimating potential losses under abnormal market conditions and risk factor movements. This 
technique enhances transparency by exploring a range of serious but plausible events.  
 
These crises scenarios simulate the results that the portfolios would generate if the extreme scenarios in question were to occur. The Bank’s stress testing 
framework, which is to all positions generating market risk currently comprises the following range of different stress test scenarios: 
 
  sharp parallel increases/decreases in interest rates; non-parallel movements (flattening and steepening) and increases/decreases in credit spreads; 
  sharp stock market crash coupled with a significant increase in volatility; increase in stock prices associated with less volatility; increase in the volatility of 
the term structure coupled with a decrease in stock prices; 
  significant increases/decreases in commodity prices coupled with increases/decreases in volatility; short-term and long-term increases/decreases in 
commodity prices; 
  depreciation/appreciation of the U.S. dollar and of other currencies relative to the Canadian dollar.

As part of its core banking activities, such as lending and deposit taking, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the potential negative 
impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Bank’s annual net interest income and economic value of equity. Activities related to hedging, investments and term 
funding are also exposed to structural interest rate risk. The Bank’s main exposure to interest rate risk stems from a variety of sources: 
 
  yield curve risk, which refers to changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve; 
  repricing risk, which arises from timing differences in the maturity and repricing of on- and off-balance-sheet items; 
  options risk, either implicit (e.g., prepayment of mortgage loans) or explicit (e.g., capped mortgages and rate guarantees) in balance sheet products; 
  basis risk that is caused by imperfect correlation between different yield curves. 
 
The Bank’s exposure to structural interest rate risk is assessed and controlled mostly through the impact of stress scenarios and market shocks on the economic 
value of the Bank’s equity and on 12-month net interest income projections. These metrics are based on cash flow projections prepared using a number of 
assumptions. Specifically, the Bank has developed key assumptions on loan prepayment levels, deposit redemptions, and the behaviour of customers that were 
granted rate guarantees. These specific assumptions were developed based on historical analyses and are reviewed frequently. 
 
Funds transfer pricing is a process by which the Bank’s business units are charged or paid according to their use or supply of funding. Through this mechanism, 
all funding activities as well as the interest rate risk and liquidity risk associated with those activities are centralized in the Global Funding and Treasury Group.  
 
Active management of structural interest rate risk can significantly enhance the Bank’s profitability and add to shareholder value. The Bank’s goal is to maximize 
its economic value of equity and annual net interest income considering the Bank’s risk appetite. This has to be accomplished within prescribed risk limits and 
is done primarily by implementing a policy framework approved by the Board, which establishes a risk tolerance threshold, monitoring structures controlled by 
the various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities and segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding 
plan that incorporates the expected growth of assets and liabilities. 
 
Regulatory Context 
On May 30, 2019, OSFI released a revised version of its B-12 guideline, Interest Rate Risk Management. The guideline outlines OSFI’s expectations regarding 
the management of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) in areas such as governance processes, risk measurement, development of stress test 
scenarios as well as key behavioural and modelling assumptions. D-SIBs will have to apply this revised guideline as of January 1, 2020.  
 
Governance 
Management of the Bank’s structural interest rate risk is mandated to the Global Funding and Treasury Group. In this role, the executives and personnel of this 
group are responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks inherent to structural interest rate risk hedging decisions and operations. They act as the 
primary effective challenge function with respect to the execution of these activities. The Office of the President approves and endorses the structural interest 
rate exposure and strategies on the recommendation of the Global Funding and Treasury Group. The Risk Management Group is responsible for assessing 
structural interest rate risk, monitoring activities, and ensuring compliance with the structural interest rate risk policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that 
an appropriate risk management framework is in place and ensures compliance with the risk appetite framework and policy. Structural interest rate risk 
supervision is mainly provided by the Financial Markets Risk Committee. This committee reviews exposure to structural interest rate risk, the use of limits, and 
changes made to assumptions.

Stress Testing and Crisis Scenarios 
Stress tests are performed on a regular basis to assess the impact of various scenarios on annual net interest income and on the economic value of equity in 
order to guide the management of structural interest rate risk. Crisis scenarios are performed where the yield curve level, slope and shape are shocked. Yield 
curve basis and volatility scenarios are also performed. All risk factors mentioned above are covered by specific scenarios and have Board-approved or GRC-
approved risk limits.  
 
Dynamic simulation is also used to project the Bank’s future net interest income, future economic value and future structural interest rate risk exposure. These 
simulations project cash flows of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet products over a given investment horizon. Given their dynamic nature, they encompass 
assumptions pertaining to changes in volume, client term preference, prepayments of deposits and loans, and the yield curve.  
 
The following tables present the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates on the 
economic value of equity and on the net interest income of the non-trading portfolios for the next 12 months, assuming no further hedging is undertaken.

The Bank has created securities portfolios in liquid and less liquid securities for strategic, long-term investment and liquidity management purposes. These 
investments carry market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and concentration risk. 
 
The investment governance sets out the guiding principles and general management standards that must be followed by all those who manage portfolios of 
these securities included in the portfolios of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this investment governance, business units that are active in managing these 
types of portfolios must adopt internal investment policies that set, among other things, targets and limits for the allocation of assets in the portfolios concerned 
and internal approval mechanisms. The primary objective is to reduce concentration risk by industry, issuer, country, type of financial instrument and credit 
quality.  
 
Overall limits in value and in proportion to the Bank’s equity are set on the outstanding amount of liquid preferred shares, liquid equity securities excluding 
preferred shares, and instruments classified as illiquid securities in the securities portfolios. The overall exposure to common shares with respect to an individual 
issuer and the total outstanding amount invested in private equity funds, for investment banking services, are also subject to limits. Restrictions are also set on 
investments defined as special. Lastly, the Bank has a specific strategic investment policy, approved by the Board, which defines strategic investments as 
purchases of business assets or acquisitions of significant interests in an entity for purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship.

The Bank’s structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. This risk, 
predominantly in U.S. dollars, is measured by assessing the impact of currency fluctuations on net interest income and shareholders’ equity. The Bank uses 
financial instruments (derivative and non-derivative) to hedge some of this risk. An adverse change in foreign exchange rates can also impact the Bank’s capital 
ratios due to the amount of RWA denominated in a foreign currency. When the Canadian dollar depreciates relative to other currencies, unrealized translation 
gains on the Bank’s net investments in foreign operations, net of related hedges, are reported in other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. In addition, 
the Canadian-dollar equivalent of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and regulatory capital deductions increases. The reverse is true when the Canadian dollar 
appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. The structural foreign exchange risk exposure is managed to ensure that the potential impacts on the capital ratios and 
net income are within tolerable limits set by risk policies.

Liquidity and funding risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to honour daily cash and financial obligations without resorting to costly and untimely measures. 
Liquidity and funding risk arises when sources of funds become insufficient to meet scheduled payments under the Bank’s commitments. Liquidity risk stems 
from mismatched cash flows related to assets and liabilities as well as the characteristics of certain products such as credit commitments and non-fixed-term 
deposits.  
 
The Bank’s primary objective as a financial institution is to manage liquidity such that it supports the Bank’s business strategy and allows it to honour its 
commitments when they come due, even in extreme conditions. This is done primarily by implementing a policy framework approved by the Board, which 
establishes a risk appetite, monitoring structures controlled by various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities and 
segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding plan that incorporates the expected growth of assets and liabilities.  
 
Regulatory Environment 
The Bank works closely with national and international regulators to implement regulatory liquidity standards. The Bank adapts its processes and policies to 
reflect the Bank’s liquidity risk appetite towards these new requirements. 
 
The Liquidity Adequacy Requirements are reviewed annually to reflect domestic and international regulatory changes. They constitute OSFI's proposed liquidity 
framework and include six chapters:  
 
  overview; 
  liquidity coverage ratio (LCR); 
  net stable funding ratio (NSFR);  
  net cumulative cash flow (NCCF);  
  liquidity monitoring tools; 
  intraday liquidity monitoring tools.   
 
The LCR is used to ensure that banks can overcome severe short-term stress, while the NSFR is a structural ratio over a one-year horizon. The NCCF metric is 
defined as a monitoring tool that calculates a survival period. It is based on the assumptions of a stress scenario prescribed by OSFI that aims to represent a 
combined systemic and bank-specific crisis.  
 
The Bank publishes the LCR on a quarterly basis. It is currently monitoring the NSFR ratio and will be compliant therewith as of the effective date of January 1, 
2021, with OSFI having published the final version of the Net Stable Funding Ratio Disclosure Requirements guideline on April 11, 2019, which sets out NSFR 
ratio disclosure requirements for D-SIBs. These requirements will be applicable as of January 1, 2020, but since OSFI has introduced an additional year to 
implement the disclosure framework, they will take effect on January 1, 2021. On April 11, 2019, OSFI also issued a new version of its Liquidity Adequacy 
Requirements guideline, which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. This version differs from the previous one and seeks to ensure that liquidity risk 
measuring and monitoring standards reflect current sound practices.  
 
On May 23, 2019, OSFI updated the covered bond limit calculation. Effective August 1, 2019, total assets pledged by a deposit-taking institution for covered 
bonds must not, at any time, represent more than 5.5% of the issuer’s on-balance-sheet assets. 
 
On July 18, 2019, OSFI published proposed changes to guideline B-6 – Liquidity Principles for public consultation. The current version was last updated in 2012, 
and the proposed changes aim to ensure that the guideline remains current, relevant, and appropriate to the scale and complexity of institutions. OSFI is targeting 
an implementation date of January 1, 2020.

The Global Funding and Treasury Group is responsible for managing liquidity and funding risk. Although the day-to-day and strategic management of risks 
associated with liquidity, funding and pledging activities is assumed by the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Risk Management Group is responsible for 
assessing liquidity risk and overseeing compliance with the resulting policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that an appropriate risk management 
framework is in place and ensures compliance with the risk appetite framework. This structure provides an independent oversight and effective challenge for 
the liquidity, funding and pledging decisions, strategy, and exposure.   
 
The Bank’s Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance policy requires review and approval by the RMC, based on recommendations from the GRC. The Bank 
has established two levels of limits. The first level of limits encompasses the Bank’s overall liquidity position and is Board approved, while the second level of 
limits is more focused on specific elements of liquidity risk and is approved by the GRC. The Board not only approves the supervision of day-to-day risk 
management and governance but also backup plans in anticipation of emergency and liquidity crisis situations. If a limit has to be revised, the Risk Management 
Group with the support of the Global Funding and Treasury Group, submits the proposed revision to the GRC. If the latter approves the request, it is presented to 
the Board for approval only if a level-one limit is concerned. 
 
Oversight of liquidity risk is entrusted mainly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee, whose members include representatives of the Financial Markets segment, 
the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Risk Management Group, and Internal Audit.

Through the Financial Markets Risk Committee, the Risk Management Group regularly reports changes in liquidity, funding and pledging indicators and 
compliance with regulatory, Board and GRC approved limits. If control reports indicate non-compliance with the limits and, generally, deterioration of liquidity 
indicators, the Global Funding and Treasury Group takes remedial action. According to the escalation process, problematic situations are reported to 
management and to the GRC and the RMC. An executive report on the Bank’s liquidity and funding risk management, which describes the Bank’s liquidity position 
and informs the Board of non-compliance with the limits and other rules observed during the reference period as well as remedial action taken, is submitted 
quarterly to the RMC.

The Bank performs liquidity management, funding and pledging operations not only from its head office and regional offices in Canada, but also through certain 
foreign centres. Although the volume of such operations abroad represents a sizable portion of global liquidity management, the Bank’s liquidity management 
is centralized. By organizing liquidity management, funding and pledging activities within the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Bank can better coordinate 
enterprise-wide funding and risk monitoring activities. All internal funding transactions between Bank entities are controlled by the Global Funding and Treasury 
Group. 
 
This centralized structure streamlines the allocation and control of liquidity management, funding and pledging limits. Nonetheless, the Liquidity, Funding and 
Pledging Governance policy contains special provisions for the financial centres that are most active in terms of institutional funding and sets limits and 
monitoring thresholds for secured and unsecured short-term funding, both in absolute value and materiality.  
 
The Bank’s funds transfer pricing system prices liquidity by allocating the cost or income to the various business segments. Liquidity costs are allocated to 
liquidity-intensive activities, mainly long-term loans, and commitments to extend credit and less liquid securities as well as strategic investments. The liquidity 
compensation is credited to the suppliers of funds, primarily funding in the form of stable deposits from the Bank’s distribution network.  
 
Short-term day-to-day funding decisions are based on a daily cumulative net cash position, which is controlled using liquidity ratio limits. Among these ratios 
and metrics, the Bank pays particular attention to the funds obtained on the wholesale market and to cumulative cash flows over various time horizons. 
 
Moreover, the Bank’s collateral pledging activities are monitored in relation to the different limits set by the Bank and are subject to monthly stress tests using 
simulations. In particular, the Bank uses various scenarios to estimate the potential amounts of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a 
downgrade to the Bank’s credit rating.  
 
Liquidity risk can be assessed in many different ways using different liquidity indicators. One of the key monitoring tools of liquidity risk is the Bank’s survival 
period based on contractual maturity and behavioural assumptions applied to balance sheet items as well as off-balance-sheet commitments.  
 
Stress Testing and Crisis Scenarios 
Using various simulations, survival period measures the number of months it would take to completely utilize the Bank’s liquid assets if the Bank were to lose 
deposits prematurely or if funds from wholesale markets were not renewed at maturity. It is measured monthly using three scenarios, which were developed to 
assess sensitivity to a Bank-specific and/or systemic crisis. Deposit loss simulations are carried out based on their degree of stability, while the value of certain 
assets is encumbered by an amount reflecting their readiness for liquidation in a crisis. Appropriate scenarios and limits are included in the Bank's liquidity, 
funding and pledging governance policy. 
 
The Bank maintains an up-to-date, comprehensive financial contingency and crisis recovery plan that describes the measures to be taken in the event of a critical 
liquidity situation. This plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Board as part of business continuity and recovery planning. For additional information, 
see the Regulatory Compliance Risk Management section of this MD&A. 
 
Liquidity Risk Appetite 
The Bank monitors and manages its risk appetite through liquidity limits, ratios and stress tests. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite is based on the following 
principles: 
 
  ensure the Bank has a sufficient amount of unencumbered liquid assets to cover its financial requirements, in both normal and stressed conditions; 
  ensure the Bank keeps a liquidity buffer above the minimum regulatory requirement; 
  ensure the Bank maintains diversified and stable sources of funding. 
 
Liquid Assets 
To protect depositors and creditors from unexpected crisis situations, the Bank holds a portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets that can be readily liquidated to 
meet financial obligations. The majority of unencumbered liquid assets are held in Canadian or U.S. dollars. Moreover, all assets that can be quickly monetized 
are considered liquid assets. The Bank’s liquidity reserves do not factor in the availability of the central bank’s emergency liquidity facilities. The following tables 
provide information on the Bank’s encumbered and unencumbered assets.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  
The LCR was introduced primarily to ensure banks maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand periods of severe short-term stress. OSFI has been requiring Canadian 
banks to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. An LCR above 100% ensures that banks are holding sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover net cash 
outflows given a severe, 30-day liquidity crisis. The assumptions underlying the LCR scenario were established by the BCBS and OSFI. 
 
The following table provides average LCR data calculated using the daily figures in the quarter. For the quarter ended October 31, 2019, the Bank’s average LCR 
was 146%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement and demonstrating the Bank’s solid liquidity position.

(1)  OSFI prescribed a table format in order to standardize disclosure throughout the banking industry. 
(2)  Unweighted values are calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows). 
(3)  Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates. 
(4)  Total adjusted values are calculated after the application of both haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and any applicable caps. 
(5)  The data in this table has been calculated using averages of the daily figures in the quarter. 
 
As at October 31, 2019, Level 1 liquid assets represented 79% of the Bank’s HQLA, which includes cash, central bank deposits, and bonds issued or guaranteed 
by the Canadian government and Canadian provincial governments. 
 
Cash outflows arise from the application of OSFI-prescribed assumptions on deposits, debt, secured funding, commitments and additional collateral 
requirements. The cash outflows are partly offset by cash inflows, which come mainly from secured loans and performing loans. The Bank expects some quarter-
over-quarter variation between reported LCRs, and such variation may not be indicative of a trend. The variation between the quarter ended October 31, 2019 
and the previous quarter was a result of normal business activities. The Bank’s liquid asset buffer is well in excess of its total net cash outflows.  
 
The LCR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures presented in the tables on the previous pages or those used for internal 
liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework was prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank’s internal liquidity metrics use assumptions that are 
calibrated according to its business model and experience.

Intraday Liquidity 
The Bank manages its intraday liquidity in such a way that the amount of available liquidity exceeds its maximum intraday liquidity requirements. The Bank 
monitors its intraday liquidity on an hourly basis and the evolution is presented monthly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee.  
 
FFuunnddiinngg  RRiisskk  
Funding risk is defined as the risk to the Bank’s ongoing ability to raise sufficient funds to finance actual or proposed business activities on an unsecured or 
secured basis at an acceptable price. The Bank maintains a good balance of its funding through appropriate diversification of its unsecured funding vehicles, 
securitization programs and secured funding. The Bank also diversifies its funding by currency, geography and maturity. The funding management priority is to 
achieve an optimal balance between deposits, securitization, secured funding and unsecured funding. This brings optimal stability to the funding and reduces 
vulnerability to unpredictable events.  
 
Funding and liquidity levels remained sound and robust over the year and the Bank does not foresee any event, commitment or demand that might have a 
significant impact on its funding and liquidity risk position. For additional information, see the table entitled Residual Contractual Maturities of Balance Sheet 
Items and Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.  
 
Credit Ratings 
The credit ratings assigned by ratings agencies represent their assessment of the Bank’s credit quality based on qualitative and quantitative information provided 
to them. Credit ratings may be revised at any time based on various factors, including macro-economic factors, methodologies used by ratings agencies, or the 
current and projected financial condition of the Bank. Credit ratings are one of the main factors that influence the Bank’s ability to access financial markets at a 
reasonable cost. A downgrade in the Bank’s credit ratings could adversely affect the cost, size and term of future funding and could also result in increased 
requirement to pledge collateral or decreased capacity to engage in certain collateralized business activities at a reasonable cost, including hedging and 
derivatives transactions.  
 
Funding and liquidity levels remained sound and robust, and the Bank continues to enjoy excellent access to the market for its funding needs. The Bank received 
favourable credit ratings from all the agencies, reflecting the high quality of its debt instruments, and the Bank's objective is to maintain these high ratings. On 
July 29, 2019, DBRS Limited (DBRS) changed the trend on all the Bank’s ratings and its related entities from "Stable" to "Positive" to reflect improvements in its 
assessment of the Bank's funding and liquidity levels. For Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, the outlook remains unchanged at "Stable."  The following table presents

Funding Strategy 
The main objective of the funding strategy is to support the Bank's organic growth while also enabling it to survive potentially severe and prolonged crises and 
to meet its regulatory obligations and financial targets. 
 
The Bank’s funding framework is summarized as follows: 
 
  pursue a diversified deposit strategy to fund core banking activities through stable deposits coming from the networks of each of the Bank’s major business 
segments;  
  incorporate the regulatory framework into day-to-day liquidity management and into the long-term funding plan by leveraging a strong risk management 
culture and centralized expertise; 
  maintain active access to various markets to ensure a diversification of institutional funding in terms of source, geographic location, currency, instrument 
and maturity, whether or not funding is secured.  
 
The funding strategy is implemented in accordance with the overall objectives of strengthening the Bank's franchise among market participants and 
consolidating its excellent reputation. The Bank continuously monitors and analyzes the possibilities for accessing less expensive and more flexible funding. 
The deposit strategy remains a priority for the Bank, which continues to prefer deposits to institutional funding. 
 
The Bank actively monitors and controls liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within and across entities, business segments, and currencies. The process 
involves evaluating the liquidity position of individual business segments in addition to that of the Bank as a whole as well as the liquidity risk from raising 
unsecured and secured funding in foreign currencies. The funding strategy is implemented through the funding plan and deposit strategy, which are monitored, 
updated to reflect actual results and regularly evaluated.

Diversified Funding Sources 
The primary purpose of diversification by source, geographic location, currency, instrument, maturity and depositor is to mitigate liquidity and funding risk by 
ensuring that the Bank maintains alternative sources of funds that strengthen its capacity to withstand a variety of severe yet plausible institution-specific and 
market-wide shocks. To meet this objective, the Bank: 
 
  takes funding diversification into account in the business planning process; 
  maintains a variety of funding programs to access different markets; 
  sets limits on funding concentration; 
  maintains strong relationships with fund providers; 
  is active in various funding markets of all tenors and for various instruments; 
  identifies and monitors the main factors that affect the ability to raise funds. 
 
The Bank is active in the following funding and securitization platforms: 
 
  Canadian dollar Senior Unsecured Debt; 
  U.S. dollar Senior Unsecured Debt programs; 
  Canadian Medium-Term Note Shelf;  
  U.S. dollar Commercial Paper programs; 
  U.S. dollar Certificates of Deposit; 
  Euro Medium-Term Note program; 
  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation securitization programs; 
  Canadian Credit Card Trust II;  
  Legislative Covered Bond program.

Risk Management   
 
  
OOppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  
 
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from an inadequacy or a failure ascribable to human resources, equipment, processes, technology or external events. 
Operational risk exists for every Bank activity. Theft, fraud, cyberattacks, unauthorized transactions, system errors, human error, amendments to or 
misinterpretation of laws and regulations, litigation or disputes with clients, inappropriate sales practice behaviour or property damage are just a few examples 
of events likely to cause financial loss, harm the Bank’s reputation or lead to punitive damages or regulatory penalties or sanctions. 
 
Although operational risk cannot be eliminated entirely, it can be managed in a thorough and transparent manner to keep it at an acceptable level. The Bank’s 
operational risk management framework is built on the concept of three lines of defence and provides a clear allocation of responsibilities to all levels of the 
organization, as mentioned below.   
  
OOppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk  
The operational risk management framework is described in the Operational Risk Management Policy, which is derived from the Risk Management Policy. The 
operational risk management framework is aligned with the Bank's risk appetite and is made up of policies, standards, and procedures specific to each 
operational risk, which fall under the responsibility of specialized groups. 
 
The segments use several operational risk management tools and methods to identify, assess, and monitor their operational risks and control measures. With 
these tools and methods, the segments can: 
 
  recognize and understand the inherent and residual risks to which their activities and operations are exposed; 
  identify how to mitigate the identified risks and monitor them to keep them at an acceptable level;  
  proactively and continuously manage risks.

Collection and Analysis of Data on Operational Losses Incurred by the Bank 
The Operational Risk Unit applies a process, across the Bank and its subsidiaries, for collecting and compiling data on internal operational losses. This data is 
entered into a centralized database and includes the amount of each loss, the type of risk involved, a description of the event that caused the loss, and the date 
of the loss, making it possible to better understand the fundamental causes of this type of loss and develop mitigation strategies. During fiscal years 2019 and 
2018, there were no material losses resulting from an operational risk event. 
 
Analysis and Lessons Learned From Operational Events Observed in Other Large Businesses  
By collecting and analyzing media-reported information about significant operational events, in particular events related to information security and theft of 
personal information experienced by other financial institutions, the Bank can assess the effectiveness of its own operational risk management practices and 
reinforce them, if necessary.  
 
Operational Risk Self-Assessment Program 
The operational risk self-assessment program gives each business unit and corporate unit the means to proactively identify and assess new or major operational 
risks to which they are exposed, evaluate the effectiveness of mitigating controls, and develop action plans to keep such risks at acceptable levels. 
 
Key Risk Indicators 
The business units and corporate units define key indicators associated with their main operational risks. The key indicators are used to monitor operational risk 
profiles and are related to critical thresholds that, once reached, result in action by management. Using key risk indicators, the business units can track risks 
and proactively detect any adverse change in risk exposure.  
  
Scenario Analysis 
Scenario analysis, which is part of a Bank-wide stress testing program, is an important and useful tool for assessing the potential impacts arising from major 
operational events. It helps the Bank define its risk appetite, set its exposure limits, and engage in strategic planning. More specifically, it helps senior 
management to better understand the risks facing the Bank and to make appropriate management decisions to mitigate potential operational risks. 
 
Insurance Program 
In order to protect itself against any material losses related to its exposure to unforeseeable operational risks, the Bank also has adequate insurance, the nature 
and amount of which meet its coverage requirements. 
  
OOppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  RReeppoorrttss  aanndd  DDiisscclloossuurreess  
Operational events for which the financial impact exceeds the tolerance thresholds or that have a significant regulatory or reputation impact are submitted to 
the decision-making levels concerned. Management is obligated to report on its management process and to remain alert to current and future issues. Reports 
on the Bank’s risk profile, highlights, and emerging risks are periodically submitted, on a timely basis, to the Operational Risk Management Committee, the GRC 
and the RMC. This reporting enhances the transparency and proactive management of the main operational risk factors.

Regulatory compliance risk is the risk of the Bank or its employees failing to comply with the regulatory requirements in effect where the Bank does business, 
both in Canada and internationally. Regulatory compliance risk is present in all of the daily operations of each Bank segment. A situation of regulatory non-
compliance can adversely affect the Bank’s reputation and result in penalties, fines and sanctions or increased oversight by regulators. 
 
OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonnaall  SSttrruuccttuurree  ooff  CCoommpplliiaannccee  
Compliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank. The Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer 
serves as both chief compliance officer (CCO) and chief anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing officer (CAMLATFO). She is responsible for 
implementing and updating the Bank’s compliance program and the AML/ATF program across all Bank segments. Having a reporting relationship with the Chair 
of the RMC, the CCO and CAMLATFO meets with him on at least once every quarter. With him, she goes over matters on the relationship between the Compliance 
Service and the Bank’s management and on access to the information required. The CCO and CAMLATFO can also communicate directly with officers and directors 
of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres.  
  
RReegguullaattoorryy  CCoommpplliiaannccee  FFrraammeewwoorrkk  
The Bank operates in a highly regulated industry. To ensure sound management of regulatory compliance, the Bank favours proactive approaches and 
incorporates regulatory requirements into its day-to-day operations.   
 
Regulatory compliance risk management ensures that events stemming from regulatory non-compliance are proactively identified and understood and that 
mitigating strategies are implemented. Such proactive management also provides reasonable assurance that the Bank is in compliance, in all material respects, 
with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.  
 
The implementation of a regulatory compliance risk management framework across the Bank is entrusted to the Compliance Service, which has the following 
mandate: 
 
  make sure that policies and standards that ensure compliance with the regulations are in effect, including regulations related to AML/ATF, to international 
sanctions, and to corruption; 
  develop compliance and AML/ATF training programs for Bank employees, officers, and directors;  
  exercise independent oversight and monitor the programs, policies, and procedures implemented by the Bank, its subsidiaries, and foreign centres to ensure 
that the control mechanisms are sufficient, respected, and effective; 
  report relevant compliance and AML/ATF matters to the Bank’s Board and inform it of any changes in the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk management 
framework.  
  
The Bank holds itself to high regulatory compliance risk management standards in order to earn the trust of its clients, its shareholders, the market and the 
general public.  
  
Described below are the main regulatory developments that have been monitored over the past year. 
 
Consumer Protection 
Last year saw several regulatory changes. Notably, several amendments to the Quebec Consumer Protection Act came into force, and the industry adopted a 
voluntary code of conduct to protect seniors. In addition, Bill C-86 was adopted by the Government of Canada and will substantially amend the Bank Act (Canada). 
The purpose of these regulatory changes is to ensure consumer protection by fostering transparency and informed decision-making. Furthermore, the Bank 
constantly monitors the consumer protection landscape such that it can change its business practices if necessary. The Bank also makes sure its practices are 
aligned with industry practices by taking part in a variety of events that bring together players from the financial services ecosystem.  
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) Activities  
On July 10, 2019, the Government of Canada published amendments to the regulations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing 
Act (2019), which will come into force in three stages. Amendments regarding identification methods may be applied once the Financial Transactions and Reports 
Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) publishes its guideline on the topic, and the other amendments will come into force in June 2020 and June 2021. Regarding 
the five-year review of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, Canadian banks are still awaiting the introduction of the bill.    
 
Privacy and Data Protection 
Due to changes in technologies and in society at large, privacy and data protection is a topical issue in Canada. In Europe, the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) has been in force since May 2018, and several companies have received substantial penalties for contravening this regulation. In the United 
States, California has also adopted a stringent privacy protection act, which will come into force in January 2020. Changes in legislation related to the protection 
of personal information could accelerate in several jurisdictions, including Canada. This acceleration could be reflected in the granting of greater powers to the 
regulators responsible for privacy protection, such as the power to impose penalties. We are monitoring the relevant legislative developments.

Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) 
Changes in the Government of Canada’s deposit insurance framework have been announced concerning information on co-owned accounts and accounts held 
in trust as well as on the insurability of certain deposits. As of April 30, 2020, coverage will be extended to insurable deposits in foreign currencies and to term 
deposits with maturities exceeding five years. In addition, as of April 30, 2021, separate coverage will be granted for Registered Education Savings Plans and 
Registered Disability Savings Plans. New requirements will also be established for the coverage of deposits in trust, particularly nominee-brokered deposits. 
 
Recovery and Resolution Planning  
As part of the regulatory measures used to manage systemic risks, D-SIBs are required to have in place recovery and resolution plans. A recovery plan is 
essentially a road map that guides the recovery of a bank in the event of severe financial stress; conversely, a resolution plan guides its orderly wind-down in 
the event of failure when recovery is no longer an option. The Bank improves and periodically updates its recovery and resolution plans to prepare for these high-
risk, but low-probability events. These plans are presented to its domestic regulatory authorities. In addition, the Bank and other D-SIBs continue to work with 
the CDIC to develop a comprehensive settlement plan that would ensure orderly winding down of the Bank’s operations.  
 
Section 871(m) – Dividend Equivalent Payments 
Section 871(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code aims to ensure that non-U.S. persons pay tax on payments that can be considered dividends on U.S. shares, 
when these payments are made on certain derivative instruments. The derivative instruments for which the underlyings are U.S. shares or “non-qualified indices” 
concluded as of January 1, 2017 are subject to the withholding and reporting requirements. The effective date for certain components of this regulation has been 
deferred from January 1, 2019 to January 1, 2021. Some of the obligations of a qualified derivatives dealer, established under subsection 871(m) of the IRC and 
the qualified intermediary agreement have also been deferred to January 1, 2021.  
 
Good Practice in the Foreign Exchange Market 
The FX Global Code is a voluntary code of good practice that applies to all participants in the wholesale foreign exchange market in all of the world’s financial 
centres. The code is the result of nearly two years of collaborative effort among central banks, including the Bank of Canada, and market participants from the 
world’s leading financial centres. The code defines the good practices to be followed by market participants to guarantee a robust, fair and transparent foreign 
exchange market. It covers such areas as ethics, governance, execution of orders (confirmation and settlement), information sharing, and risk management. The 
Bank completed implementation of the code of good practice and published a declaration of compliance with the FX Global Code on its website. 
 
Reform of Benchmark Interest Rates 
The reform of benchmark interest rates is a global initiative coordinated and led by central banks and public authorities around the world, including in Canada. 
The objective is to improve benchmarks by ensuring that they satisfy robust international standards. The initiative will introduce other benchmarks as potential 
successors to benchmark interest rates such as the Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR), which are the benchmark rates used by the major international banks for 
short-term loans on the interbank market. These rates, particularly LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are widely used as benchmark rates around the world 
for derivative financial instruments, bonds and other floating-rate instruments. The gradual elimination of the IBOR rates will have an impact on over-the-counter 
derivative transactions, and the Bank expects that a standardized solution for the industry will be adopted, probably in the form of an ISDA protocol. For some 
other types of contracts, contractual amendments are anticipated by the end of 2021, when some of the current rates are expected to be eliminated. 
 
RReeppuuttaattiioonn  RRiisskk  
 
Reputation risk is the risk that the Bank’s operations or practices will be judged negatively by the public, whether that judgment is with or without basis, thereby 
adversely affecting the perception, image or trademarks of the Bank, potentially resulting in costly litigation or loss of income. Reputation risk generally arises 
from a deficiency in managing another risk. The Bank’s reputation may, for example, be adversely affected by non-compliance with laws and regulations or by 
process failures. All risks must therefore be managed effectively in order to protect the Bank’s reputation. 
 
The Bank seeks to ensure that its employees are constantly aware of the potential repercussions of their actions on the Bank’s reputation and image. In addition 
to the previously discussed operational risk management initiatives, a variety of mechanisms are in place to support sound reputation risk management, 
including codes of professional conduct applicable to all employees, policies regarding ethics and corporate governance and appropriate training programs.   
 
The Bank also has a reputation risk policy, approved by the RMC of the Board, that covers all of the Bank’s practices and transactions, including those of the 
third parties with which it establishes business relationships. The policy sets the reputation risk management principles and rules. The policy is complemented 
by the special provisions of the new products and activities policy, which determines the approvals required by the various committees that assess risk whenever 
new products or activities are introduced within the business units. These provisions are intended, among other things, to provide oversight for the management 
of reputation risk, which may be material for such products or activities. The new products and activities policy requires that any new product or activity for which 
reputation risk is determined to be high be submitted to the GRC for approval. The activities of the Compliance Service, Legal Affairs Department, Public Relations 
Department and Investor Relations Department complete the reputation risk management framework.

Strategic risk is the risk of a loss arising from inappropriate strategic orientations, improper execution or ineffective response to economic, financial, or regulatory 
changes. The corporate strategic plan is developed by the Office of the President, in alignment with the Bank’s overall risk appetite, and approved by the Board. 
Once approved, the initiatives of the strategic plan are monitored regularly to ensure that they are progressing. If not, strategies could be reviewed or adjusted 
if deemed appropriate.  
 
In addition, the Bank has a specific Board-approved policy for strategic investments, which are defined as purchases of business assets or acquisitions of 
significant interests in an entity for the purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship. As such, acquisition projects and other strategic 
investments are analyzed through a due diligence process to ensure that these investments are aligned with the corporate strategic plan and the Bank’s risk 
appetite.

Environmental risk is the risk of an environmental issue leading to a loss in financial or operating value or harming the Bank’s reputation or having an impact on 
its stakeholders. Consequently, physical risks resulting from the impacts of increases in the number and intensity of extreme weather events, as well as transition 
risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy, require particular attention to reduce the Bank’s exposure to these negative externalities and, at the same 
time, seize new growth opportunities. 
 
The Bank, aware that it has a mobilizing role to play in environmental matters, announced its support for the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and will disclose, in addition to its performance reports, the information recommended by the task force.  
 
The TCFD has structured its recommendations around four pillars that represent an organization’s operating fundamentals: governance, strategy, risk 
management, and metrics and targets. These four major classes of recommendations are intended to provide a framework for the publication of climate-related 
financial information such that institutional investors can make informed choices about their exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities.

Oversight by the Board of Directors (Board) 
The Board identifies environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, including the impacts that climate change could have on the organization as a whole, 
and monitors the evolution of those issues.  
 
The Risk Management Committee, Audit Committee, and Conduct Review and Corporate Governance Committee are responsible for periodically examining the 
efforts made by the Bank to ensure that it is operating in accordance with high standards of corporate responsibility, including in environmental issues. This 
year, their respective mandates were expanded in this regard. Each year, the Board also reviews the Bank’s Social Responsibility Report, which notably provides 
details about its contribution to environmental protection.  
 
To further clarify the Bank’s commitment to exercising effective governance with regard to mechanisms to oversee risks and opportunities related specifically to 
the climate, the Risk Management Committee has a specific responsibility to ensure that the risk management framework takes ESG risks into account such that 
they are appropriately identified and monitored and integrated into the existing risk management processes. 
  
Management’s Role 
The Bank oversees climate-related risks through the risk management framework and various executive committees. The Enterprise-Wide Risk Management 
Committee (co-chaired by the Executive Vice-President, Risk Management and the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance) is regularly 
informed of developments and issues to facilitate monitoring and discussion such that issues can be effectively resolved when necessary.  
  
SSttrraatteeggyy  
The Bank has committed, through its mission, to make a positive impact on its stakeholders. It works to ensure that its commitments are reflected throughout 
its practices, including the transition to a low-carbon economy.  
 
An identification of environment-related risks and opportunities has helped the Bank to evolve and incorporate climate matters into its internal decision-making. 
There are many opportunities to limit environmental risks—including climate-related risks—and their impacts on the community. With this in mind, the Bank 
plans on offering more solutions whereby clients can increase their presence in low-carbon activities such as renewable energies and responsible investment. 
For example, a program that allows for the issuance of sustainability bonds will enable various organizations, including the Bank itself, to issue debt securities 
to finance projects that meet certain environmental and social criteria. The Bank also provides financial support to environmental organizations whose mission 
is to promote sustainable development and protect biodiversity and natural environments.

Risk Management   
 
  
Over the past year, the Bank has completed a classification of the physical risks and transition-related risks based on each of the industries that make up its 
credit portfolios. In addition, in response to the TCFD’s recommendations, the Bank assessed the proportion of its carbon-related exposures to better understand 
the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on its credit portfolios. The results of these assessments will allow the Bank to start by examining its 
investment and asset growth strategy in more detail. They will also help guide the Bank’s climate scenario analyses of these industries in the years to come. The 
Bank will communicate the results of these analyses in an open and transparent manner. The Bank continues to work with its peers to find solutions for more 
accurate and consistent analyses and assessments of climate-related risks and opportunities. It is also a member of several strategic working groups, helping it 
to stay abreast of developments related to ESG risks, particularly climate risks.

Risk Identification, Assessment and Management  
The Bank recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks. To this end, it proactively monitors all risks as well as its 
segments’ risk exposures in relation to its risk appetite and established limits. Top and emerging risks are risks that could have a material adverse effect on the 
Bank’s financial results, reputation, or long-term business model and strategy. These risks include credit, market, liquidity, operational, and ESG risks as well 
as climate-related risks. In addition, rapidly changing economic, regulatory, technological and business environments may have an impact on certain activities 
or on the Bank as a whole. 
 
Based on the TCFD's recommendations, the Bank has identified two types of relevant climate-related risks to include in its monitoring activities: physical risks 
and transition-related risks. It defines physical risks as the potential impacts on its physical assets and financial assets arising from more frequent and more 
intense extreme weather events, food insecurity, and energy and resource supply problems related to climate change. The Bank defines transition-related risks 
as the impacts arising from the move toward a low-emission economy. Such impacts include technological changes or public policy directions that could lead to 
a revaluation of the company's assets and result in new costs or new opportunities. The Bank’s definition of transition-related risk also includes market risk and 
reputational risk.  
 
The Bank ensures that it has processes in place to proactively identify and measure these risks so that it can implement appropriate mitigation strategies. To 
this end, the Bank has implemented an environmental policy that applies to activities and decisions across the Bank as well as in all its business segments. This 
policy clearly sets out the established principles for identifying and limiting environmental risk as well as the impacts on the community and its business 
segments.  
  
Incorporation of Risk 
Given that environmental risk is associated with credit risk and operational risk, the Bank recognizes the importance of incorporating several additional control 
measures into its existing risk management processes.  To this end, risks are regularly reported to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee.   
 
The Bank's current approach to controlling risks includes regularly identifying and prioritizing the impacts of physical risks and transitional risks. This applies 
to all industries affected by the Bank's assets. In the interests of proactively ensuring the strategic positioning of its entire portfolio, the Bank has expressed its 
desire to support the energy transition toward a lower-carbon economy. Through its credit adjudication process, it seeks to develop and implement a process 
for assessing and quantifying the impacts of climate change on its strategy and results.

Measures Used to Assess Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities 
To date, the Bank has implemented several measures to manage climate-related risks and opportunities related to its investment, funding, and operational 
strategies. Among other things, the Bank calculates its own annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it performs a calculation and analysis of the proportion 
of its carbon-related investments that serves as a guide to discussions about strategic alignment and risk appetite.   
  
GHG Emissions  
The Bank has carried out a voluntary annual inventory of its GHG emissions since 2008. It reports the information to the Carbon Disclosure Project, which 
compiles several types of climate data.  
  
Objectives for Managing Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities 
The Bank is committed to reducing its environmental footprint by implementing, on a voluntary basis, various eco-responsible measures aimed at calculating 
and reducing its GHG emissions. This includes significant improvements made to the energy efficiency of its facilities over the past 15 years. The Bank has 
implemented an innovative system for managing the energy consumption of 300 branches that uses a web-based interface. As a result, the Bank can monitor its 
facilities in real time with a view to managing its energy consumption more effectively. 
  
OOuuttllooookk  aanndd  NNeexxtt  SStteeppss  
For the coming year, the Bank will focus its efforts on: 
 
  growing the proportion of its renewable-energy-related funding assets at a faster pace than those related to fossil fuels; 
  offering to support customers in their energy transitions; 
  developing indicators for effectively monitoring its sustainable development performance; 
  strengthening its partnerships with the industry's main change agents in order to meet its commitments.

A summary of the significant accounting policies used by the Bank is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report. Some 
of these accounting policies are considered critical given their importance to the presentation of the Bank’s financial position and operating results and require 
subjective and complex judgments and estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain. Any change in these judgments and estimates could have a significant 
impact on the Bank’s consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting estimates are as follows. 
 
CCllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss  
 
At initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be 
classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank 
determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these 
financial assets. 
 
For the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The 
interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, 
and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset 
are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
When classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a 
same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are 
generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that 
it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the 
relevant evidence available at the date of determination. 
 
A financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect” business model when the Bank’s primary objective is to hold these financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows from them and not to sell them. When the Bank’s objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial 
assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect and sell” business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank’s objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily 
measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a “hold to collect” business model or a “hold to collect and sell” business model. 
  
FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss  
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price). 
 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, based on bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities, provide the best evidence of fair 
value. A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible 
at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis. 
 
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes 
the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. 
Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects 
market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value. 
 
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. 
If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based 
on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is 
deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized 
balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks 
associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt 
or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.

In certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair 
value but that are not included in the measurement technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or risk related to the 
valuation model and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when 
it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient 
volume of transactions in a given market. The measurement adjustments also include the funding valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial 
instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. 
 
IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. The 
fair value hierarchy has the following levels: 
 
Level 1 
Inputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. 
These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities 
actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 
 
Level 2 
Valuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the 
asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or 
corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative 
financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active 
market, liabilities related to transferred receivables as well as certain other liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
Valuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial 
instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may 
also be partly based on observable market inputs. Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of investments in hedge funds, certain 
derivative financial instruments, equity and debt securities of private companies, certain loans, and certain deposits (structured deposit notes).  
 
Establishing fair value is an accounting estimate and has an impact on Securities at fair value through profit or loss, certain Loans, Securities at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, Obligations related to securities sold short, Derivative financial instruments, financial instruments designated at fair value through 
profit or loss, and financial instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This estimate also 
has an impact on Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income of the Financial Markets segment and of the Other heading. Lastly, this estimate 
has an impact on Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. For additional information on the fair value 
determination of financial instruments, see Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
IImmppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  
 
At the end of each reporting period, the Bank applies a three-stage impairment approach to measure the expected credit losses (ECL) on all debt instruments 
measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and on loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at 
fair value. ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. The ECL model is forward looking. 
Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future 
events and economic conditions. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimates, determining movements between the three stages, and applying 
forward-looking information. Any changes in assumptions and estimates, as well as the use of different, but equally reasonable, estimates and assumptions, 
could have an impact on the allowances for credit losses and the provisions for credit losses for the year. All business segments are affected by this accounting 
estimate. For additional information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

The ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the 
credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, 
and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses 
that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of 
the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to 
Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a 
financial asset have occurred, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime 
expected losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in 
Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3. 
    
AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSiiggnniiffiiccaanntt  IInnccrreeaassee  iinn  CCrreeddiitt  RRiisskk    
In determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking 
information to assess deterioration in credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased 
significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected 
life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All 
financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. 
The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment. 
 
MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  
ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and 
reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The 
estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. The cash shortfall is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
owed to the Bank and all the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.  
 
The measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument’s probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at 
default (EAD). Forward-looking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) are 
incorporated into the risk parameters. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by 
evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, 
an upside scenario and a downside scenario. Probability weights are attributed to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly 
and are subject to management review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known 
or expected risk factors and information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process. 
 
ECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a 
corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Allowances for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are not measured at fair value are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

On initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank determines whether the asset is credit-impaired. For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase 
or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative 
changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition. 
 
DDeeffiinniittiioonn  ooff  DDeeffaauulltt  
The definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used 
for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more 
events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a 
settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due. 
  
WWrriittee--OOffffss  
A financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be 
non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances 
owing are not likely to be recovered.  
 
IImmppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  
 
Premises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or 
intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are 
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired. 
 
An asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual 
asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs will be determined. Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or a group of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify 
CGUs. 
 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected 
future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected 
future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant 
impact on income. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and 
an impairment loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Management exercises judgment when determining whether there is objective evidence that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives 
may be impaired. It also uses judgment in determining to which CGU or group of CGUs an asset or goodwill is to be allocated. Moreover, for impairment 
assessment purposes, management must make estimates and assumptions regarding the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, CGUs or a group of CGUs. 
For additional information on the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU, see Note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
Any changes to these estimates and assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amount of a non-financial asset and, consequently, on impairment 
testing results. These accounting estimates have an impact on Premises and equipment, Intangible assets and Goodwill reported on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. The aggregate impairment loss, if any, is recognized as a non-interest expense for the corresponding segment and presented in the Other  item.

calculations incorporate management’s best estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care

Remeasurements of these plans result in actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding the 
net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net asset or liability of the plans. Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive

The Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process includes estimating the actual amount of 
income taxes payable and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of the items reported for 
accounting and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, presented in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date 
of the future event is revised based on current information. The Bank periodically evaluates deferred tax assets to assess recoverability. In the Bank’s opinion, 
based on the information at its disposal, it is probable that all deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration.

The Bank has a 24.9% equity interest in Maple Financial Group Inc. (Maple), a privately owned Canadian company that operated through direct and indirect 
wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
  
Maple Bank GmbH (Maple GmbH), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Maple, has been the subject of an investigation into alleged tax irregularities by German 
prosecutors since September 2015 and, to the Bank’s knowledge, that investigation is ongoing. The Bank understands that the investigation is focusing on 
selected trading activities by Maple GmbH and some of its former employees, primarily during taxation years 2006 to 2010. The German authorities have alleged 
that these trading activities, often referred to as “cum/ex trading,” violated German tax laws. Neither the Bank nor its employees were involved in these trading 
activities and, to the Bank’s knowledge, are not the subject of this investigation. At that time, the Bank announced that if it were determined that portions of the 
dividends it received from Maple could be reasonably attributed to tax fraud by Maple GmbH, arrangements would be made to repay those amounts to the 
relevant authority. 
 
On February 6, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple GmbH preventing it 
from carrying out its normal business activities. In August 2016, Maple filed for bankruptcy under applicable Canadian laws, and a trustee was appointed to 
administer the company. Similar proceedings were initiated for each of Maple’s other material subsidiaries in their home jurisdictions. In light of the situation, 
the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity interest in Maple in an amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income taxes) during the first quarter of 
2016. The $164 million write-off of the equity interest in this associate was recognized in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement 
of Income for the year ended October 31, 2016 and was reported in the Financial Markets segment. 
 
While there has not yet been a determination of tax fraud on the part of Maple GmbH or its employees, in the insolvency proceedings of Maple GmbH the German 
finance office issued a declaration about the result of the tax audit at Maple GmbH and about the relevant tax consequences of the cum/ex trading and concluded 
a final tax claim of the tax authorities against the insolvency administrator. This claim was approved by the Maple GmbH creditor assembly.   
 
The Bank has been in contact with the German prosecutors, who have confirmed that, in their view based upon the evidence they have considered since the 
occurrence of the insolvency, the Bank was not involved in any respect with the alleged tax fraud undertaken by Maple GmbH nor was it negligent in failing to 
identify that alleged fraud. Further to discussions between the Bank and the German prosecutors concerning the amounts deemed attributable to the alleged 
tax fraud, the Bank paid 7.7 million euros to the German tax authorities on November 19, 2019. 
 
The Bank has been engaging in discussions with the bankruptcy and insolvency administrators of relevant Maple entities regarding potential claims they may 
assert against Maple’s former shareholders in relation to the insolvency of Maple and its subsidiaries. The Bank does not see a legal basis for any such liability 
but is nevertheless continuing discussions at this time. If any payments are required, they are not expected to be material to the Bank’s financial position.

In the normal course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating, among other matters, to loan portfolios, investment 
portfolios and supplier agreements, including court proceedings, investigations or claims of a regulatory nature, class actions or other legal remedies of varied 
natures.  
 
More specifically, the Bank is involved as a defendant in class actions instituted by consumers contesting, inter alia, certain transaction fees or who wish to avail 
themselves of certain legislative provisions relating to consumer protection. The recent developments in the main legal proceedings involving the Bank are as 
follows: 
 
WWaattssoonn  
In 2011, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa Corporation Canada (Visa) and MasterCard International Incorporated 
(MasterCard) (the Networks) as well as National Bank and a number of other Canadian financial institutions. A similar action was also initiated in Quebec, Ontario, 
Alberta and Saskatchewan. In each of the actions, the Networks and financial institutions are alleged to have been involved in a price-fixing system to maintain 
and increase the fees paid by merchants on transactions executed using the credit cards of the Networks. In so doing, they would notably be in breach of the 
Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. In 2017, a settlement was reached with the plaintiffs; in 2018 
it was approved by the trial courts in each of the five jurisdictions where the action was initiated. The rulings approving the settlement are now the subject of 
appeal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions.

On January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating 
application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-
sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer 
Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages. 
 
It is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based 
on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a 
material impact on the Bank’s consolidated results of operation for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank’s consolidated 
financial position.  
  
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a 
past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks 
and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money.  
 
The recognition of a litigation provision requires the Bank’s management to assess the probability of loss and estimate any potential monetary impact. The Bank 
examines each litigation provision individually by considering the development of each case, its past experience in similar transactions and the opinion of its 
legal counsel. Each new piece of information can alter the Bank’s assessment as to the probability and estimated amount of the loss and the extent to which it 
adjusts the recorded provision. Moreover, the actual settlement cost of these litigations can be significantly higher or lower than the amounts recognized.

In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into arrangements and transactions with structured entities. Structured entities are entities designed so that 
voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the 
relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity is consolidated when the Bank concludes, after evaluating the 
substance of the relationship and its right or exposure to variable returns, that it controls that entity. Management must exercise judgment in determining 
whether the Bank controls an entity. Additional information is provided in the Securitization and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements section of this MD&A and in 
Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

The IASB issues revisions and amendments to a number of standards, some of which have already had an impact on the Bank and others that could have an 
impact in the future. The Bank is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the following standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. A 
summary of these amendments and the effective dates applicable to the Bank are presented below.  
   
EEffffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  ––  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22001199  
IFRS 16 – Leases 
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases. The new standard replaces the previous lease accounting standard, IAS 17 – Leases, and related 
interpretations. Under IAS 17, lessees and lessors were required to classify their leases as either finance leases or operating leases and to account for these two 
types of leases differently. IFRS 16 provides a single accounting model for lessees, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset as well as a liability that 
reflects the present value of future lease payments. Lessees will also recognize depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease 
liability in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As for lessors, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting in IAS 17, with the distinction 
between finance and operating leases being retained.  
 
The Bank has elected to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective basis by adjusting the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2019, the date of 
initial application, with no restatement of comparative periods. The most significant impact to the Bank will be related to real estate leases, which are currently 
classified as operating leases.  
 
On transition, the Bank will apply, on a lease-by-lease basis, certain practical expedients. More specifically, it will measure the right-of-use assets at an amount 
equal to the lease liability, it will rely on the Bank’s assessment about whether leases are onerous as at October 31, 2019 as an alternative to performing an 
impairment test as at November 1, 2019, and it will exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use assets as at November 1, 2019. 
Furthermore, on transition and thereafter, the Bank will exclude leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, will exclude short-term leases and, for real 
estate leases, will elect not to separate non-lease components from lease components.  
 
As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s best estimate of the impact of adopting IFRS 16 is an increase in total assets of approximately $653 million representing 
leased premises, an increase in total liabilities of approximately $653 million primarily representing lease liabilities, and a decrease of approximately 9 basis 
points in the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio as at November 1, 2019. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments 
In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23, which addresses how to reflect tax treatment uncertainty in accounting for income taxes. This interpretation 
will not have an impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2019. 
 
EEffffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  ––  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22002200  
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 
On March 29, 2018, the IASB published Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to replace its 2010 conceptual framework. For the IASB, the revised 
conceptual framework has been in effect since its publication date. Early application is permitted. 
 
Reform to Benchmark Interest Rates (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) 
In September 2019, in response to uncertainty arising from the phasing-out of benchmark interest rates such as interbank offered rates (IBORs), the IASB issued 
amendments to its new and former financial instrument standards, IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement as well as to the related standard on disclosures, IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures.  
 
The amendments modify certain hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 39 to provide relief from the potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the 
IBOR reform. In addition, the amendments to IFRS 7 require additional disclosure about hedging relationships directly affected by this uncertainty. When the 
Bank adopted IFRS 9 on November 1, 2017, it made an accounting policy choice to continue applying the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements.  
 
For the Bank, the effective date of these amendments is November 1, 2020. However, early adoption is permitted. 
 
EEffffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  ––  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22002211  
IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, a new standard that replaces IFRS 4, the current insurance contract accounting standard. IFRS 17 
introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. At its meeting on November 14, 2018, the IASB 
tentatively decided to defer the IFRS 17 effective date to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

The consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada (the Bank) have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), 
which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI), the financial statements are to be 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS represent 
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
Management maintains the accounting and internal control systems needed to discharge its responsibility, which is to provide reasonable assurance that the 
financial accounts are accurate and complete and that the Bank’s assets are adequately safeguarded. Controls that are currently in place include quality 
standards on staff hiring and training; the implementation of organizational structures with clear divisions of responsibility and accountability for performance; 
the Code of Professional Conduct; and the communication of operating policies and procedures.  
 
As Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer, we have overseen the evaluation of the design and operation of the Bank’s internal controls over financial 
reporting in accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosures in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings released by the Canadian Securities 
Administrators. Based on the evaluation work performed, we have concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting were effective as at October 31, 
2019 and that they provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is reliable and that the Bank’s consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
 
The Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving the financial information contained in the Annual Report. Acting through the Audit 
Committee, the Board also oversees the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and ensures that accounting and control systems are maintained. 
Composed of directors who are neither officers nor employees of the Bank, the Audit Committee is responsible, through Internal Audit, for performing an 
independent and objective review of the Bank’s internal control effectiveness, i.e., governance processes, risk management processes and control measures. 
Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviews the consolidated financial statements and recommends their approval to the Board. 
 
The control systems are further supported by the presence of the Compliance Service, which exercises independent oversight and evaluation in order to assist 
managers in effectively managing regulatory compliance risk and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with regulatory requirements.  
 
Both the Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit and the Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer have a direct 
functional link to the Chair of the Audit Committee and to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee. They both also have direct access to the President and 
Chief Executive Officer. 
 
In accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), OSFI is mandated to protect the rights and interests of the depositors. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into 
the business and affairs of the Bank, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being satisfied and that the Bank is in 
sound financial condition. 
 
The independent auditor, Deloitte LLP, whose report follows, was appointed by the shareholders on the recommendation of the Board. The auditor has full and 
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss audit and financial reporting matters.

To the Shareholders of National Bank of Canada, 
  
OOppiinniioonn 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of National Bank of Canada  (the Bank), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at October 31, 
2019 and 2018, and the consolidated statements of income,  the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in 
equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of 
significant accounting policies (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). 
 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at October 31, 2019 and 2018, 
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS). 
 
BBaassiiss  ffoorr  OOppiinniioonn  
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards (Canadian GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:  
 
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis;

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In 
connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  
 
We obtained Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor’s report. If, based on the work we have performed on 
this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor’s report. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to a going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report (cont.) 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.  
  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a 
material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. 
  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the note disclosures, and whether the financial statements 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion 
on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. 
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, 
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards. 
 
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Chantal Leclerc.

National Bank of Canada (the Bank) is a financial institution incorporated and domiciled in Canada and whose shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Its head office is located at 600 De La Gauchetière Street West in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Bank is a chartered bank under Schedule 1 of the Bank Act 
(Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). 
 
National Bank of Canada offers financial services to individuals, businesses, institutional clients and governments throughout Canada as well as specialized 
services at the international level. It operates four business segments, namely, the Personal and Commercial segment, the Wealth Management segment, the 
Financial Markets segment, and the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. Its full line of services includes banking and investing solutions 
for individuals and businesses, corporate banking and investment banking services, securities brokerage, insurance, and wealth management. 
 
On December 3, 2019, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the publication of the Bank’s audited annual consolidated financial statements 
(the consolidated financial statements) for the year ended October 31, 2019. 
 
BBaassiiss  ooff  PPrreesseennttaattiioonn  
 
The Bank’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as 
otherwise specified by OSFI, the financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting 
requirements are exceptions to IFRS. 
 
The accounting policies covered in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section have been applied consistently to all periods presented and include 
the changes described hereafter in the Accounting Policy Changes section, which have been applied since November 1, 2018 following adoption of IFRS 15 – 
Revenue From Contracts With Customers (IFRS 15). As permitted by IFRS 15, the Bank did not restate comparative consolidated financial statements. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency.

Effective November 1, 2018, the Bank adopted IFRS 15, which replaces the previous revenue recognition standards and interpretations. Excluded from the scope 
of IFRS 15 are revenues related to lease contracts, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. Fees earned, which are an integral component of the effective 
interest rate of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost, are within the scope of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and are therefore outside the 
scope of IFRS 15. Most of the Bank’s revenues, including net interest income, are not impacted by the adoption of this standard.  
 
IFRS 15 provides a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The new revenue recognition model is 
based on a control approach that differs from the risks and rewards approach applied under previous IFRS. The revenue streams that fall within the scope of IFRS 
15 are fee and commission income, and the applicable significant accounting policies are described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section. 
However, the adoption of IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact on the Bank’s revenue recognition accounting policies.  
 
The core principle of IFRS 15 is to recognize revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a promised service is transferred to 
a customer and in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the service. Revenue may therefore be 
recognized at a point in time, upon completion of the service, or over time as services are provided. 
 
The Bank has elected to apply IFRS 15 using the modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment 
to the opening balance of Retained earnings without restating comparative figures. Adoption of IFRS 15 resulted in a $4 million decrease to opening Retained 
earnings as at November 1, 2018.

In preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management must exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reporting date carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, net income, and related information. Furthermore, certain accounting policies require complex 
judgments and estimates because they apply to matters that are inherently uncertain, in particular accounting policies applicable to the following: the fair value 
determination of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, the impairment of non-financial assets, pension plans and other post-employment 
benefits, income taxes, provisions, the consolidation of structured entities, and the classification of debt instruments. Descriptions of these judgments and 
estimates are provided in each of the notes related thereto in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could therefore differ from these estimates, 
in which case the impacts are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of future fiscal periods. The accounting policies described in this note provide 
greater detail about the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on judgment.

Subsidiaries 
These consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries, after elimination of 
intercompany transactions and balances. Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Bank. A structured entity is an entity created 
to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, 
such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.  
 
Management must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank must consolidate an entity. The Bank controls an entity only if the following three 
conditions are met: 
 
  it has decision-making authority regarding the entity’s relevant activities;  
  it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and 
  it has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the returns. 
 
When determining decision-making authority, the Bank considers many factors, including the existence and effect of actual and potential voting rights held by 
the Bank that can be exercised as well as the holding of instruments that are convertible into voting shares. In addition, the Bank must determine whether, as 
an investor with decision-making rights, it acts as a principal or agent.  
 
Based on these principles, an assessment of control is performed at the inception of a relationship between any entity and the Bank. When performing this 
assessment, the Bank considers all facts and circumstances, and it must reassess whether it still controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there are changes to one or more of the three conditions of control. 
 
The Bank consolidates the entities it controls from the date on which control is obtained and ceases to consolidate them from the date control ceases. The Bank 
uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from a third party on the date control is obtained.

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) 
 
Non-Controlling Interests 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity interests held by third parties in the Bank’s subsidiaries and are presented in total Equity, 
separately from Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. The non-controlling interests’ proportionate shares of the net income and other comprehensive 
income of the Bank’s subsidiaries are presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, respectively. 
 
With respect to units issued to third parties by mutual funds and certain other funds that are consolidated, they are presented at fair value in Other liabilities on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lastly, changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognized as equity transactions. 
The difference between the adjustment in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized 
directly in Equity attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. 
 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
The Bank exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. The 
Bank has joint control when there’s a contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, and joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 
Investments in associates, i.e., entities over which the Bank exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures, i.e., entities over which the Bank 
has rights to the net assets and exercises joint control, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded 
at cost and, following acquisition, the Bank’s shares in the net income and in the other comprehensive income are recognized, respectively, in Non-interest 
income in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The carrying 
value of the investment is adjusted by an equivalent amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reduced by distributions received.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank’s functional and presentation currency. Each foreign operation of 
the Bank determines its own functional currency, and the items reported in the financial statements of each foreign operation are measured using that currency. 
 
Monetary items and non-monetary items measured at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at exchange 
rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at historical 
rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are 
recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income, except for equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive 
income, for which unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income. 
  
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional currency at the exchange 
rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, whereas the revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated into the Bank’s functional 
currency at the average exchange rates for the period. Any goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a foreign operation that does not have the same functional 
currency as the parent company, and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition, are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Unrealized translation 
gains and losses relating to foreign operations, along with the impact of hedges and income taxes on the related results, are presented in Other comprehensive 
income. On disposal of a foreign operation, any accumulated translation gains and losses, along with the related hedges, recorded in the Accumulated other 
comprehensive income item of this foreign operation, are reclassified to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

At initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be 
classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank 
determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these 
financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or as at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
For the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The 
interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, 
and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset 
are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.

When classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a 
same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are 
generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that 
it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the 
relevant evidence available at the date of determination. 
 
A financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect” business model when the Bank’s primary objective is to hold these financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows from them and not to sell them. When the Bank’s objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial 
assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a “hold to collect and sell” business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and 
selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank’s objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily 
measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a “hold to collect” business model or a “hold to collect and sell” business model. 
 
Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
A financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if certain conditions are met. The Bank may apply this 
option if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that 
would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases and if the fair values are reliable. 
Financial assets thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income. Interest income arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Net interest income in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
A financial liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized. Financial liabilities thus designated are 
recognized at fair value, and any changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Other comprehensive income unless 
these changes offset the amounts recognized in Net income. Fair value changes not attributable to the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in Non-interest 
income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income will not be subsequently reclassified to Net income. 
Interest expense arising from these financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in the Net interest income item of the 
Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following cases: 
 
  If, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities on different bases, and if the fair values are reliable. 
  If a group of financial assets and financial liabilities to which an instrument belongs is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with the Bank’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information is provided on that basis to senior management. 
Consequently, the Bank may use this option if it has implemented a documented risk management strategy to manage a group of financial instruments 
together on the fair value basis, if it can demonstrate that significant financial risks are eliminated or significantly reduced, and if the fair values are reliable. 
  For hybrid financial instruments with one or more embedded derivatives that would significantly modify the cash flows of the financial instruments and that 
would otherwise be bifurcated and accounted for separately. 
 
Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
At initial recognition, an investment in an equity instrument that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration recognized in a business combination 
may be irrevocably designated as being at fair value through other comprehensive income. In accordance with this designation, any change in fair value is 
recognized in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification to net income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include: (i) debt securities for which the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, 
on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a “hold to collect and 
sell” business model and (ii) equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains and 
losses to net income. 
 
The Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through other comprehensive income on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. 
Interest income and dividend income are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Debt Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Debt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of 
expected credit losses and income taxes, and provided that they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in Other 
comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest income – 
Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized over 
the expected life of the instrument to interest income using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Equity Securities Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income 
Equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are presented, net of 
income taxes, in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of realized gains and losses to net income. Transaction costs incurred upon 
the purchase of such equity securities are not reclassified to net income upon the sale of the securities. 
 
Securities Measured at Amortized Cost 
Securities measured at amortized cost include debt securities for which the contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a “hold to collect” business model. 
 
The Bank recognizes these securities transactions at fair value on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. After initial recognition, debt securities 
in this category are recorded at amortized cost. Interest income is recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Premiums, discounts 
and related transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the instrument to interest income using the effective interest rate method. Securities 
measured at amortized cost are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Securities not classified or designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or at amortized cost are classified as measured at fair 
value through profit or loss. 
 
Securities measured at fair value through profit or loss include (i) securities held for trading, (ii) securities designated at fair value through profit or loss, (iii) all 
equity securities other than those designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassifications of gains and 
losses to net income, and (iv) debt securities for which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and any interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. 
 
The Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through profit or loss on the settlement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value 
between the trade date and the settlement date are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized at fair value. Interest income, any transaction costs, as well as realized and unrealized gains or 
losses on securities held for trading are recognized in Non-interest income – Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Dividend income 
is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income on securities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded 
in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on these securities are recognized in Non-interest income 
– Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Realized and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities at fair value through profit or loss, other than those held for trading, as well as debt securities for 
which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are recognized in Non-interest income 
– Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The dividend and interest income on these financial assets are 
recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Obligations Related to Securities Sold  
Under Repurchase Agreements, and Securities Borrowed and Loaned  
The Bank recognizes these transactions at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, except when they are designated at fair value through profit 
or loss and are recorded at fair value. These transactions are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Securities sold under repurchase agreements remain on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase 
agreements are treated as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions.

The Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part 
of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral pledged or received in 
the form of cash is recognized in financial assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the collateral is pledged or received in the form of cash, the interest income and expense are recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.  
 
Loans 
Loans Measured at Amortized Cost 
Loans classified as measured at amortized cost include loans originated or purchased by the Bank that are not classified as measured at fair value through profit 
or loss or designated at fair value through profit or loss. These loans are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., 
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All loans originated by the Bank are recognized when cash is 
advanced to a borrower. Purchased loans are recognized when the cash consideration is paid by the Bank. 
 
All loans are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable costs and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate 
method, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. For purchased performing loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan is amortized to 
interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. For purchased credit-impaired loans, the acquisition date 
fair value adjustment on each loan consists of management’s estimate of the shortfall of principal and interest cash flows that the Bank expects to collect and 
of the time value of money. The time value of money component of the fair value adjustment is amortized to interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
using the effective interest rate method. Loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Loans Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
Loans classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, loans designated at fair value through profit or loss, and loans for which the contractual cash 
flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 
interest income on loans at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Changes in the fair value of loans classified as at fair value through profit or loss and loans designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in Non-
interest income – Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. With respect to loans whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income – Other in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income. 
 
Reclassification of Financial Assets 
A financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument or a financial asset that, at initial recognition, was designated as measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, is reclassified only in rare situations, i.e., when there is a change in the business model used to manage the financial asset. The reclassification is 
applied prospectively from the reclassification date. 
 
EEssttaabblliisshhiinngg  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price).   
 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, based on bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities, provide the best evidence of fair 
value. A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible 
at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.  
 
When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes 
the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. 
Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects 
market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value. 
 
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. 
If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based 
on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is 
deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized 
balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks 
associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt 
or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.

In certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair 
value but that are not included in the measurement technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are 
not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or risk related to the 
valuation model, and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when 
it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient 
volume of transactions in a given market.  
 
As permitted when certain criteria are met, the Bank has elected to determine fair value based on net exposure to credit risk or market risk for certain portfolios 
of financial instruments, mainly derivative financial instruments. 
  
IImmppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss    
At the end of each reporting period, the Bank applies a three-stage impairment approach to measure the expected credit losses (ECL) on all debt instruments 
measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and on loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at 
fair value. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, 
current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions. 
 
Determining the Stage 
The ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the 
credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, 
and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses 
that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of 
the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to 
Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a 
financial asset have occurred, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime 
expected losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in 
Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3. 
 
Assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk 
In determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking 
information to assess deterioration in credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased 
significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected 
life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial 
recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All 
financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. 
The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment. 
 
Measurement of Expected Credit Losses 
ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and 
reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The 
estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. The cash shortfall is the difference between all contractual cash flows 
owed to the Bank and all cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.  
 
The measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument’s PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD). Forward-
looking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and GDP are incorporated into the risk parameters. The 
estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The 
Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario and a downside scenario. 
Probability weights are attributed to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and are subject to management review. The 
Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and information were 
not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process.

ECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments measured 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a 
corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Allowances for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures that are not measured at fair value are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. 
 
Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired Financial Assets 
On initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank determines whether the asset is credit-impaired. For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase 
or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative 
changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition. 
 
Definition of Default 
The definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used 
for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more 
events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a 
settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due. 
 
Write-offs 
A financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be 
non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances 
owing are not likely to be recovered.  
 
DDeerreeccooggnniittiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  aanndd  SSeeccuurriittiizzaattiioonn  
A financial asset is considered for derecognition when the Bank has transferred contractual rights to receive the cash flows or assumed an obligation to transfer 
these cash flows to a third party. The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when it considers that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
have been transferred or when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset expire. When the Bank considers that it has retained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset and, if applicable, recognizes a financial liability on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If, due to a derivative financial instrument, the transfer of a financial asset does not result in derecognition, the derivative 
financial instrument is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
When the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial asset 
it no longer controls. Any rights and obligations retained following the asset transfer are recognized separately as an asset or liability. If the Bank retains control 
of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset, i.e., to the extent to which it is exposed to 
changes in the value of the transferred asset. 
 
In order to diversify its funding sources, the Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the Mortgage-
Backed Securities Program under the National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. Under the first program, the Bank issues 
NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgages and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT). As part of these 
transactions, the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership of the mortgage loans sold. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans 
securitized under the CMB program continue to be recognized in the Loans item of the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and the liabilities for the 
considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Moreover, insured 
mortgage loans securitized and retained by the Bank continue to be recognized in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

This financial liability represents the Bank’s obligation to deliver the securities it sold but did not own at the time of sale. Obligations related to securities sold

In the normal course of business, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments to meet the needs of its clients, to generate trading activity revenues, and to 
manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk and other market risks. 
 
All derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are 
included in assets, and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value are included in liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where there are 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative financial instruments is reported either as an asset or as a liability. 
 
Embedded Derivative Financial Instruments 
An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host, the effect being that some of the cash flows of the combined 
instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by 
the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, 
credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to one of the parties to the contract.  
 
A derivative embedded in a financial liability is separated from the host contract and treated as a separate derivative if, and only if, the following three conditions 
are met: the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, the embedded derivative is a 
separate instrument that meets the definition of a derivative financial instrument, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Embedded derivatives that are separately accounted for are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and subsequent changes in fair value are 
recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In general, all embedded derivatives are presented on a combined basis with the 
host contract. However, certain embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract are presented in Derivative financial instruments on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
Held-for-Trading Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses (including interest income and expense) are 
recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 
Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Policy 
The purpose of a hedging transaction is to modify the Bank’s exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash 
flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting ensures that offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period or periods. 
 
Documenting and Assessing Effectiveness 
The Bank designates and formally documents each hedging relationship, at its inception, by detailing the risk management objective and the hedging strategy. 
The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability, or cash flows being hedged, the related hedging instrument, the nature of the specific risk exposure or 
exposures being hedged, the intended term of the hedging relationship, and the method for assessing the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the hedging 
relationship. At the inception of the hedging relationship, and for every financial reporting period for which the hedge has been designated, the Bank ensures 
that the hedging relationship is highly effective and consistent with its originally documented risk management objective and strategy. When a hedging 
relationship meets the hedge accounting requirements, it is designated as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a foreign exchange hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation. 
 
Fair Value Hedges 
For fair value hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of a hedged item. The carrying amount of the hedged item is 
adjusted based on the effective portion of the gains or losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as 
well as the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The resulting ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income.

The Bank prospectively discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting or if the Bank revokes the designation. When the designation is revoked, the hedged item is no longer adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, and 
the amounts previously recorded as cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are amortized 
using the effective interest rate method and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. If the hedged 
item is sold or terminated before maturity, the cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk 
are immediately recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Cash Flow Hedges 
For cash flow hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge variable cash flows attributable to the hedged risk related to a 
financial asset or liability (or to a group of financial assets or liabilities). The effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in 
Other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
The amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income of the period or periods 
during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging 
relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank cancels that designation, then the amounts previously recognized in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect 
the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations  
Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge foreign exchange risk related to investments made in foreign operations whose functional 
currency is not the Canadian dollar. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive income and 
the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon the total or partial sale of a net investment in a foreign operation, 
amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified, in whole or in part, to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income.

Premises and equipment, except for land and the head office building under construction, are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated 
impairment losses. Land and the head office building under construction are recorded at cost less any impairment losses. 
 
Premises and equipment and the significant components of a building that have different useful lives or that provide economic benefits at a different pace are 
systematically amortized over their useful lives. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis. The amortization expense is recorded 
in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Bank uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the 
acquisition-date fair value, and the transaction costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Bank acquires control of a business, all of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, including intangible assets, are recorded at fair value. The interests previously held in the acquiree are also 
measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration and all previously held interests over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets of the acquiree. If the fair value of the identifiable net assets exceeds the purchase consideration and all previously held interests, the difference is 
immediately recognized as a gain on a bargain purchase.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Bank’s ownership interest and can be initially measured 
at either fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The measurement basis is selected on a case-
by-case basis. Following an acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the value assigned to those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling 
interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the acquisition.

Intangible Assets With Finite Useful Lives   
Software and certain other intangible assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets 
are systematically amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which vary between four and ten years. The amortization expense is recorded in Non-
interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Intangible Assets With Indefinite Useful Lives  
The Bank’s intangible assets with indefinite useful lives come from the acquisition of subsidiaries or groups of assets and consist of management contracts and 
a trademark. They are recognized at the acquisition-date fair value. The management contracts are for the management of open-ended funds. At the end of each 
reporting period, the Bank reviews the useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment. 
Intangible assets are deemed to have an indefinite useful life following an examination of all relevant factors, in particular: (a) the contracts do not have 
contractual maturities; (b) the stability of the business segment to which the intangible assets belong; (c) the Bank’s capacity to control the future economic 
benefits of the intangible assets; and (d) the continued economic benefits generated by the intangible assets. 
 
IImmppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  
Premises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or 
intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are 
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.  
 
An asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual 
asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the 
asset belongs will be determined. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs. 
 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected 
future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected 
future cash flows, discount rates, and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant 
impact on income. 
 
Corporate assets, such as the head office building and computer equipment, do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
generated by other assets or groups of assets. Therefore, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management 
has decided to dispose of the asset. However, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU 
or group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and that recoverable amount is compared with the carrying amount of this CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or group of CGUs. For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting 
from a business combination must be allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each CGU or 
group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must represent the lowest level for which the goodwill is monitored internally at the Bank and must not be larger 
than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU or group of CGUs involves management’s judgment. If an impairment loss is to be recognized, 
the Bank does so by first reducing the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs and then reducing the carrying amounts of the other 
assets of the CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGUs. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss 
is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill 
must be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment was 
recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased, given that the impairment loss was reversed, but shall not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for this asset in previous years.

A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time in return for a payment or series of 
payments. A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. Title may or 
may not eventually be transferred. An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease. The Bank primarily enters into operating leases. 
 
When the Bank is the lessee under an operating lease, the rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in Non-interest expenses in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income. When the Bank is the lessor, the lease assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported in premises 
and equipment, and the rental income is recognized net of related expenses in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a 
past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be 
reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks 
and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. Provisions are 
presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Interest income and expense, except for the interest income on securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in Net interest income 
and calculated using the effective interest rate method.  
 
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through the expected life of the financial asset or financial 
liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank 
estimates expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation 
includes all fees and points paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all 
other premiums or discounts. Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for 
purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets and financial assets that were not impaired upon their purchase or origination but became impaired 
thereafter. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Bank applies the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the 
financial asset from initial recognition. The credit-adjusted effective interest rate reflects expected credit losses. As for loans that have subsequently become 
credit-impaired, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount (net of allowances for credit losses) rather than 
to the carrying amount. 
 
Loan origination fees, including commitment, restructuring, and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan. They are 
deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Direct costs for 
originating a loan are netted against the loan origination fees. If it is likely that a commitment will result in a loan, commitment fees receive the same accounting 
treatment, i.e., they are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of 
the loan. Otherwise, they are recorded in Non-interest income over the term of the commitment.  
 
Loan syndication fees are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved 
in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is 
recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Certain mortgage loan prepayment fees are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income when earned.

Fee and commission income is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a promised service is transferred to a customer 
and in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the service. The revenue may therefore be 
recognized at a point in time, upon completion of the service, or over time as services are provided.  
 
The Bank must also determine whether its performance obligation is to provide the service itself or to arrange for another party to provide the service (in other 
words, whether the Bank is acting as a principal or agent). A principal may itself satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified good or service or it 
may engage another party to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its behalf. A principal also has the primary responsibility for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the good or service to the customer and has discretion in establishing the price for the service. If the Bank is acting as a principal, revenue is 
recognized on a gross basis in an amount corresponding to the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled. If the Bank is acting as an agent, then 
revenue is recognized net of the service fees and other costs incurred in relation to the commission and fees earned.

Underwriting and Advisory Fees 
Underwriting and advisory fees include underwriting fees, financial advisory fees, and loan syndication fees. These fees are mainly earned in the Financial 
Markets segment and are recognized at a point in time as revenue upon successful completion of the engagement. Financial advisory fees are fees earned for 
assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Loan syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent 
or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging, and administering a loan syndication and are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan 
retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and 
amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. 
 
Securities Brokerage Commissions 
Securities brokerage commissions are earned in the Wealth Management segment and are recognized at a point in time when the transaction is executed.  
 
Mutual Fund and Trust Service Revenues 
Mutual fund and trust service revenues include management and administration fees. These fees are earned in the Wealth Management segment. Management 
fees are primarily calculated on assets under management and are recorded over the period the services are performed. Administration fees are generally based 
on assets under administration or management and are recorded over the period the services are performed.   
 
Card Revenues 
Card revenues are earned in the Personal and Commercial segment and include card fees such as annual and transactional fees as well as interchange fees. 
Interchange fees are recognized when a card transaction is settled. Card fees are recognized on the transaction date except for annual fees, which are recorded 
evenly throughout the year. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to interchange fees. 
 
Credit Fees and Deposit and Payment Service Charges 
Credit fees and deposit and payment service charges are earned in the Personal and Commercial, Financial Markets, and U.S. Specialty Finance and International 
segments. Credit fees are generally recognized in income over the period the services are provided. Deposit and payment service charges include fees related to 
account maintenance activities and transaction-based service charges. Fees related to account maintenance activities are recognized over the period the services 
are provided, whereas transaction-based service charges are recognized at a point in time when the transaction is completed.

Insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, are arrangements under which one party accepts significant insurance risk by agreeing to compensate the 
policyholder if a specified uncertain future event was to occur. Gross premiums, net of premiums transferred under reinsurance contracts, are recognized when 
they become due. Royalties received from reinsurers are recognized when earned. Claims are recognized when received and an amount is estimated as they are 
being processed. All these amounts are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Upon recognition of a premium, a reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized, respectively, in Other assets and in Other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of the reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized on a net basis in 
Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Income taxes include current taxes and deferred taxes and are recorded in net income except for income taxes generated by items recognized in Other

Current tax is the amount of income tax payable on the taxable income for a period. It is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates prevailing 
on the reporting date, and any adjustments recognized in the period for the current tax of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net 
balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability.

Deferred tax is established based on temporary differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, in accordance with enacted 
or substantively enacted income tax laws and rates that will apply on the date the differences will reverse. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences 
related to the following: 
 
  the initial accounting of goodwill; 
  the initial accounting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting income nor taxable income;   
  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; 
  investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and 
that there will not be taxable income to which the temporary difference can be recognized.  
 
Deferred tax assets are tax benefits in the form of deductions that the Bank may claim to reduce its taxable income in future years. At the end of each reporting 
period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is revised, and it is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be 
available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when 
the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets and liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities that intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities based on their net amount. 
 
The Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process includes estimating the actual amount of 
current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of items reported for accounting and 
for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied 
in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current 
information.  
 
The Bank is subject to the jurisdictions of various tax authorities. In the normal course of its business, the Bank is involved in a number of transactions for which 
the tax impacts are uncertain. As a result, the Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the tax risk stemming from tax 
matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. The amounts of these provisions reflect the best 
possible estimates of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. The provisions are estimated at the end of 
each reporting period. However, it is possible that, at a future date, a provision might need to be adjusted following an audit by the tax authorities. When the 
final assessment differs from the initially provisioned amounts, the difference will impact the income taxes of the period in which the assessment was made.

A financial guarantee contract is a contract or indemnification agreement that could require the Bank to make specified payments (in cash, financial instruments, 
other assets, Bank shares, or provisions of services) to reimburse a beneficiary in the event of a loss resulting from a debtor defaulting on the original or amended 
terms of a debt instrument. 
  
To reflect the fair value of the obligation assumed at the inception of a financial guarantee, a liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet. After initial recognition, the Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the allowance for credit losses determined using the ECL 
model and of the initially recognized amount less, where applicable, the cumulative amount of income recognized. This revenue is recognized in Credit fees in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. Other post-employment benefit plans include 
post-employment medical, dental, and life insurance coverage. While pension plans are funded, the other plans are not. 
 
Plan expenses and obligations are actuarially determined based on the projected benefit method prorated on service. The calculations use management’s best 
estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and retirement 
age.  
 
The net asset or net liability of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the 
present value of the future benefits earned by employees in respect of current- and prior-period service and the fair value of plan assets. The net asset or net 
liability is included in either the Other assets or Other liabilities item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The expense related to pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans consists of the following items: current service cost, net interest on the net plan 
asset or liability, administration costs, and past service cost, if any, recognized when a plan is amended. This expense is recognized in Compensation and 
employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The net amount of interest income and expense is determined by applying a discount rate to the 
net plan asset or liability amount. 
 
Remeasurements resulting from pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans represent actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit 
obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net asset or liability of the plans. 
Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income; these cumulative gains 
and losses are reclassified to Retained earnings.

The Bank has several share-based compensation plans: the Stock Option Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan, the Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plan, the 
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan, the Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of National Bank Financial, and the Employee 
Share Ownership Plan. 
 
Compensation expense is recognized over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the award. This period is generally the same as 
the vesting period, except where the required service period begins before the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees 
eligible to retire on the award date is immediately recognized on the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees who will become 
eligible to retire during the vesting period is recognized over the period from the award date to the date the employee becomes eligible to retire. For all of these 
plans, as of the first year of recognition, the expense includes cancellation and forfeiture estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as necessary. The 
Bank uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with some of these plans. The compensation expense for these plans, net of related 
hedges, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
Under the Stock Option Plan, the Bank uses the fair value method to account for stock options awarded. The options vest at 25% per year, and each tranche is 
treated as though it was a separate award. The fair value of each of the tranches is measured on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and this fair 
value is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits and Contributed surplus. When the options are exercised, the Contributed surplus amount is credited 
to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds received from the employees when these options are exercised are also credited 
to Equity – Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
SARs are recorded at fair value when awarded and their fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until they are exercised. The cost is recognized 
in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligation that 
results from the change in fair value at each period is recognized in net income gradually over the vesting period, and periodically thereafter, until the SARs are 
exercised.  When a SAR is exercised, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the increase in the stock price since the date of the award. 
 
The obligation that results from the award of a DSU, RSU, PSU and DCP unit is recognized in net income, and the corresponding amount is included in Other 
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the DSU, RSU and DCP plans, the change in the obligation attributable to variations in the share price and 
dividends paid on common shares for these plans is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period 
in which the variations occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the value of the common shares on that date. For the PSU Plan, 
the change in the obligation attributable to changes in the stock price, adjusted upward or downward depending on the relative result of the performance criteria, 
and the change in the obligation attributable to dividends paid on the shares awarded under the plan, are recognized in Compensation and employee benefits 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the period in which the changes occur. On the redemption date, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the value 
of the common shares on that date, adjusted upward or downward according to the performance criteria.  
 
The Bank’s contributions to the employee share ownership plan are expensed as incurred.

The IASB issues revisions and amendments to a number of standards, some of which have already had an impact on the Bank and others that could have an 
impact in the future. The Bank is currently assessing the impact that adoption of the following standards will have on its consolidated financial statements. A 
summary of these amendments and the effective dates applicable to the Bank are presented below.  
   
EEffffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  ––  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22001199  
IFRS 16 – Leases 
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases. The new standard replaces the previous lease accounting standard, IAS 17 – Leases, and related 
interpretations. Under IAS 17, lessees and lessors were required to classify their leases as either finance leases or operating leases and to account for these two 
types of leases differently. IFRS 16 provides a single accounting model for lessees, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset as well as a liability that 
reflects the present value of future lease payments. Lessees will also recognize depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease 
liability in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As for lessors, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting in IAS 17, with the distinction 
between finance and operating leases being retained.  
 
The Bank has elected to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective basis by adjusting the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2019, the date of 
initial application, with no restatement of comparative periods. The most significant impact to the Bank will be related to real estate leases, which are currently 
classified as operating leases.  
 
On transition, the Bank will apply, on a lease-by-lease basis, certain practical expedients. More specifically, it will measure the right-of-use assets at an amount 
equal to the lease liability, it will rely on the Bank’s assessment about whether leases are onerous as at October 31, 2019 as an alternative to performing an 
impairment test as at November 1, 2019, and it will exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use assets as at November 1, 2019. 
Furthermore, on transition and thereafter, the Bank will exclude leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, will exclude short-term leases and, for real 
estate leases, will elect not to separate non-lease components from lease components.  
 
As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s best estimate of the impact of adopting IFRS 16 is an increase in total assets of approximately $653 million representing 
leased premises, an increase in total liabilities of approximately $653 million primarily representing lease liabilities, and a decrease of approximately 9 basis 
points in the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio as at November 1, 2019. 
 
IFRIC Interpretation 23 – Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments 
In June 2017, the IASB issued IFRIC Interpretation 23, which addresses how to reflect tax treatment uncertainty in accounting for income taxes. This interpretation 
will not have an impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as at November 1, 2019. 
 
EEffffeeccttiivvee  DDaattee  ––  NNoovveemmbbeerr  11,,  22002200  
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 
On March 29, 2018, the IASB published Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to replace its 2010 conceptual framework. For the IASB, the revised 
conceptual framework has been in effect since its publication date. Early application is permitted. 
 
Reform to Benchmark Interest Rates (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7) 
In September 2019, in response to uncertainty arising from the phasing-out of benchmark interest rates such as interbank offered rates (IBORs), the IASB issued 
amendments to its new and former financial instrument standards, IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement as well as to the related standard on disclosures, IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures.  
 
The amendments modify certain hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 39 to provide relief from the potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the 
IBOR reform. In addition, the amendments to IFRS 7 require additional disclosure about hedging relationships directly affected by this uncertainty. When the

IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts, a new standard that replaces IFRS 4, the current insurance contract accounting standard. IFRS 17 
introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. At its meeting on November 14, 2018, the IASB 
tentatively decided to defer the IFRS 17 effective date to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.

Establishing Fair Value 
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction 
in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price). 
 
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets provide the best evidence of fair value. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank applies other 
valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and that minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Such valuation techniques include 
the following: using information available from recent market transactions, referring to the current fair value of a comparable financial instrument, applying 
discounted cash flow analysis, applying option pricing models, or relying on any other valuation technique that is commonly used by market participants and 
has proven to yield reliable estimates. Judgment is required when applying many of the valuation techniques. The Bank’s valuation was based on its assessment 
of the conditions prevailing as at October 31, 2019 and may change in the future. Furthermore, there may be valuation uncertainty resulting from the choice of 
valuation model used.

Note 3  ––  Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont.)    
  
VVaalluuaattiioonn  GGoovveerrnnaannccee  
Fair value is established in accordance with a rigorous control framework. The Bank has policies and procedures that govern the process for determining fair 
value. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All valuation models are validated, and controls have been 
implemented to ensure that they are applied.  
 
The fair value of existing or new products is determined and validated by functions independent of the risk-taking team. Complex fair value matters are reviewed 
by valuation committees made up of experts from various specialized functions. 
 
For financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Bank has documented the classification policies to determine the hierarchy, and 
there are controls in place to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, reliably, and consistently. Valuation methods and the underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
 
VVaalluuaattiioonn  MMeetthhooddss  aanndd  AAssssuummppttiioonnss  
Financial Instruments Whose Fair Value Equals Carrying Value 
The carrying value of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: 
 
  cash and deposits with financial institutions; 
  securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed; 
  obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned; 
  customers’ liability under acceptances; 
  acceptances; 
  certain items of other assets and other liabilities. 
 
Securities and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short 
These financial instruments, except for securities at amortized cost, are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Their fair value is based on 
quoted prices in active markets, i.e., bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities. If there are no quoted prices in an active market, 
fair value is estimated using prices for securities that, in substance, are identical. If such prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation 
techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices, the contractual prices of the underlying 
instruments, the time value of money, credit risk, interest rate yield curves and currency rates. 
 
When one or more significant inputs are not observable in the markets, fair value is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider 
the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the specific characteristics of the financial asset or liability, and other relevant factors. 
 
Securities Issued or Guaranteed by Governments 
Securities issued or guaranteed by governments include government debt securities of the governments of Canada (federal, provincial and municipal) as well as 
debt securities of the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury), of other U.S. agencies and of other foreign governments. The fair value of these securities is based on 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. For those classified in Level 2, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets are used to 
determine fair value. In the absence of an observable market, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating 
assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. 
 
Equity Securities and Other Debt Securities 
The fair value of equity securities is determined primarily by using quoted prices in active markets. For equity securities and other debt securities classified in 
Level 2, a valuation technique based on quoted prices of identical and similar instruments in an active market is used to determine fair value. In the absence of 
observable inputs, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR 
and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. For those classified in Level 3, fair value can be determined based on the net asset value, which represents 
the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from investment or fund managers or the general partners of the limited partnerships. Fair value 
can also be determined using internal valuation techniques adjusted for risk factors related to the financial instruments and for economic conditions.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For exchange-traded derivative financial instruments, fair value is 
based on the quoted price in an active market, i.e., bid prices for financial assets or offered prices for financial liabilities.  
 
For over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments, fair value is determined using well established valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions 
based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices and the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, 
interest rate yield curves, credit curves, currency rates as well as price and rate volatility factors. In establishing the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments, the Bank also incorporates the following factors: 
 
Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) 
The CVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. For each counterparty, the CVA is based 
on the expected positive exposure and probabilities of default through time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as current and 
potential future market values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The default probabilities are inferred using 
credit default swap (CDS) spreads. When unavailable, relevant proxies are used. While the general methodology currently assumes independence between 
expected positive exposures and probabilities of default, adjustments are applied to certain types of transactions where there is a direct link between the 
exposure at default and the default probabilities. 
 
Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) 
The DVA reflects the Bank’s own credit risk in the valuation of derivative financial instruments. The DVA is based on the expected negative exposure and 
probabilities of default of the Bank over time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as current and potential future market values, 
master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The market-implied spreads of the Bank are used in the calculation of the DVA.  
 
Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) 
The FVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market-implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for 
uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. The expected exposures are determined using methodologies consistent with the CVA and DVA framework. 
The funding level used to determine the FVA is based on the average funding level of relevant market participants. 
 
When the valuation techniques incorporate one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the markets, the fair value of OTC derivative financial 
instruments is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, 
the specific characteristics of the financial asset or financial liability and other relevant factors. 
 
Loans 
The fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows, adjusted for several factors, including 
prepayment options, current market interest rates for similar loans, and other relevant variables where applicable. The fair value of variable-rate mortgage loans 
is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of other fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates charged for similar 
new loans. The fair value of other variable-rate loans is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
Deposits 
The fair value of fixed-term deposits is determined primarily by discounting expected future contractual cash flows and considering several factors such as 
redemption options and market interest rates currently offered for financial instruments with similar conditions. For certain term funding instruments, fair value 
is determined using market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of demand deposits and notice deposits is deemed to equal carrying value. 
 
The fair value of structured deposit notes is established using valuation models that maximize the use of observable inputs when available, such as benchmark 
indices, and also incorporates the DVA, which reflects the Bank’s own credit risk. In calculating DVA, the market implied spreads of the Bank are used to infer its 
probabilities of default. Lastly, when fair value is determined using option pricing models, the valuation techniques are similar to those described for derivative 
financial instruments. 
 
Liabilities Related to Transferred Receivables 
These liabilities arise from sale transactions to Canada Housing Trust (CHT) of securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities under the 
Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. These transactions do not qualify for derecognition. They are recorded as guaranteed borrowings, which results in the 
recording of liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these liabilities is established using valuation techniques based on observable market 
inputs such as Canada Mortgage Bond prices.

Other Liabilities and Subordinated Debt 
The fair value of these financial liabilities is based on quoted market prices in an active market. If there is no active market, fair value is determined by discounting 
contractual cash flows using the current market interest rates offered for similar financial instruments that have the same term to maturity.

IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. This 
fair value hierarchy requires observable market inputs to be used whenever such inputs exist. According to the hierarchy, the highest level of inputs are 
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and the lowest level of inputs are unobservable inputs. If inputs from different levels of the 
hierarchy are used, the financial instrument is classified in the same level as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair 
value hierarchy has the following levels: 
 
Level 1 
Inputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. 
These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities 
actively traded in over-the-counter markets.  
 
Level 2 
Valuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the 
asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or 
corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative 
financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active 
market, liabilities related to transferred receivables and certain other liabilities. 
 
Level 3 
Valuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial 
instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may 
also be partly based on observable market inputs. 
 
Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of the following: 
 
  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss: investments in hedge funds for which there are certain restrictions on unit or security 
redemptions, equity securities and debt securities of private companies, as well as certain derivative financial instruments whose fair value is established 
using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs; 
  securities at fair value through other comprehensive income: equity and debt securities of private companies; 
  certain loans and certain deposits (structured deposit notes) whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant 
unobservable market inputs. 
 
TTrraannssffeerrss  BBeettwweeeenn  tthhee  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  HHiieerraarrcchhyy  LLeevveellss  
Transfers of financial instruments between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers to (or from) Level 3 are deemed to have taken place at the beginning of the quarter in 
which the transfer occurred. Significant transfers can occur between the fair value hierarchy levels due to new information on inputs used to determine fair value 
and the observable nature of those inputs.  
 
During fiscal 2019, $50 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $1 million in obligations related to securities sold short were 
transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 resulting from changing market conditions ($324 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $33 
million in obligations related to securities sold short in fiscal 2018). In addition, during fiscal 2019, $20 million in securities classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss and $2 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (for fiscal 2018, $37 million in securities 
classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $3 million in obligations related to securities sold short). 
 
During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, financial instruments were transferred to (or from) Level 3 due to changes in the availability of observable market inputs 
resulting from changing market conditions.

Net Asset Value 
Net asset value is the estimated value of a security based on valuations received from the investment or fund managers, the administrators of the conduits or 
the general partners of the limited partnerships. The net asset value of a fund is the total fair value of assets less liabilities. 
 
EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) Multiple and Price Equivalent 
Private equity valuation inputs include earnings multiples, which are determined based on comparable companies, and a higher multiple will translate into a 
higher fair value. Price equivalent is a percentage of the market price based on the liquidity of the security. 
 
Discount Rate 
When discounted cash flow methods are used, the discount rate is the input used to bring future cash flows to their present value. A higher discount rate will 
translate into a lower fair value. 
 
Long-Term Volatility 
Volatility is a measure of the expected future variability of market prices. Volatility is generally observable in the market through options prices. However, the 
long-term volatility of options with a longer maturity might not be observable. An increase (decrease) in long-term volatility is generally associated with an 
increase (decrease) in long-term correlation. Higher long-term volatility may increase or decrease an instrument’s fair value depending on its terms. 
 
Market Correlation 
Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two different variables. A positive correlation means that the variables tend to move in the same 
direction; a negative correlation means that the variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to measure financial instruments whose future 
returns depend on several variables. Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument’s fair value depending on the terms of its 
contractual payout.

The Bank performs sensitivity analyses for the fair value measurements of financial instruments classified in Level 3, substituting unobservable inputs with one 
or more reasonably possible alternative assumptions.  
 
For equity securities and other debt securities, the Bank varies significant unobservable inputs such as net asset values, EV/EBITDA multiples, or price 
equivalents and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $121 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at 
October 31, 2019 (a $70 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2018).  
 
For the loans, the Bank varies unobservable inputs such as a liquidity premium and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $54 million 
increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2019 ($43 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2018). 
 
For derivative financial instruments and embedded derivatives related to structured deposit notes, the Bank varies long-term volatility and market correlation 
inputs and establishes a reasonable fair value range. As at October 31, 2019, for derivative financial instruments, the net fair value could result in a $1 million 
increase or decrease ($5 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2018), whereas for structured deposit notes, the fair value could have resulted in a 
$1 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2018. 
 
For all Level 3 financial instruments, the reasonable fair value ranges could result in an 8% increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2019 (a 5 % 
increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2018).

The Bank may hedge the fair value of financial instruments classified in the various levels through offsetting hedge positions. Gains and losses for financial 
instruments classified in Level 3 presented in the following tables do not reflect the inverse gains and losses on financial instruments used for economic hedging 
purposes that may have been classified in Level 1 or 2 by the Bank. In addition, the Bank may hedge the fair value of financial instruments classified in Level 3 
using other financial instruments classified in Level 3. The effect of these hedges is not included in the net amount presented in the following tables. The gains 
and losses presented hereafter may comprise changes in fair value based on observable and unobservable inputs.

The Bank chose to designate certain financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss according to the criteria presented in Note 1 to these consolidated 
financial statements. Consistent with its risk management strategy and in accordance with the fair value option, which permits the designation if it eliminates 
or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets and liabilities or recognizing 
the gains and losses thereon on different bases, the Bank designated at fair value through profit or loss certain securities, certain securities purchased under 
reverse repurchase agreements, and certain liabilities related to transferred receivables. The fair value of liabilities related to transferred receivables does not 
include credit risk, as the holders of these liabilities are not exposed to the Bank’s credit risk. The Bank also designated certain deposits that include embedded 
derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
To determine a change in fair value arising from a change in the credit risk of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank calculates, at the 
beginning of the period, the present value of the instrument’s contractual cash flows using the following rates: first, using an observed discount rate for similar 
securities that reflects the Bank’s credit spread and, then, using a rate that excludes the Bank’s credit spread. The difference obtained between the two values 
is then compared to the difference obtained using the same rates at the end of the period. 
 
Information about the financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the following tables.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.  
 
Generally, over-the-counter financial derivatives subject to master netting arrangements of the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. or other 
similar agreements do not meet the netting criteria on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because the right of set-off is legally enforceable only in the event of 
default, insolvency or bankruptcy. 
 
Generally, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed as well as obligations related to securities sold under repurchase 
agreements and securities loaned, subject to master agreements, do not meet the netting criteria since they confer a right of set-off that is enforceable only in 
the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.  
 
However, the above-mentioned transactions may be subject to contractual netting agreements concluded with clearing houses. If the netting criteria are met, 
these transactions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, as part of these transactions, the Bank may give or receive cash or other financial 
instruments used as collateral. 
 
The following tables present information on financial assets and financial liabilities that are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because they meet the 
netting criteria and on those that are not netted and are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.

Expected credit losses are determined using a three-stage impairment approach that is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial 
recognition. 
 
Stage 1 
Financial assets that have experienced no significant increase in credit risk between initial recognition and the reporting date and for which 12-month expected 
credit losses are recorded at the reporting date are classified in Stage 1. 
 
Stage 2 
Financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk between initial recognition and the reporting date, and for which lifetime expected 
credit losses are recorded at the reporting date, are classified in Stage 2. 
 
Stage 3 
Financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, for which one or more events have had a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of these financial assets at the reporting date, and for which lifetime expected credit losses are recorded, are classified in Stage 3. 
 
POCI 
Financial assets that are credit-impaired when purchased or originated (POCI) are classified in the POCI category. 
 
IImmppaaiirrmmeenntt  GGoovveerrnnaannccee  
A rigorous control framework is applied to the determination of expected credit losses. The Bank has policies and procedures that govern impairments arising 
from credit risk. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management group. All models used to calculate expected credit losses 
are validated, and controls are in place to ensure they are applied.  
 
These models are validated by groups that are independent of the team that prepares the calculations. Complex questions on measurement methodologies and 
assumptions are reviewed by a group of experts from various functions. Furthermore, the inputs and assumptions used to determine expected credit losses are 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
 
MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  ((EECCLL))  
Expected credit losses are estimated using three main variables: (1) probability of default (PD), (2) loss given default (LGD) and (3) exposure at default (EAD). For 
accounting purposes, 12-month PD and lifetime PD are the probabilities of a default occurring over the next 12 months or over the life of a financial instrument, 
respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and on future economic conditions that have, or will have, an impact on credit risk. LGD 
reflects the losses expected should default occur and considers such factors as the mitigating effects of collateral, the realizable value thereof, and the time 
value of money. EAD is the expected balance owing at default and considers such factors as repayments of principal and interest between the balance sheet date 
and the time of default as well as any amounts expected to be drawn on a committed facility. Twelve-month expected credit losses are estimated by multiplying 
12-month PD by LGD and by EAD. Lifetime expected credit losses are estimated using the lifetime PD. 
 
For most financial instruments, expected credit losses are measured on an individual basis. Financial instruments that have credit losses measured on a collective 
basis are grouped according to similar credit risk characteristics such as type of instrument, geographic location, comparable risk level, and business sector or 
industry.

The Bank’s approach to calculating expected credit losses consists essentially of leveraging existing regulatory models and then adjusting their parameters for 
IFRS 9 purposes. These models have the advantage of having been thoroughly tested and validated. In addition, using the same base models, regardless of the 
purpose, provides consistency across risk assessments. These models use inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques that require a high degree of 
management judgment. The main factors that contribute to changes in ECL that are subject to significant judgment include the following:  
 
  calibration of regulatory parameters in order to obtain point-in-time and forward-looking parameters; 
  forecasts of macroeconomic variables for multiple scenarios and the probability weighting of the scenarios; 
  determination of the significant increases in credit risk (SICR) of a loan.

Main Parameters  
PD Estimates 
Since the objective of the regulatory calibration of PD is to align historical data to the long-run default rate, adjustments are required to obtain a point-in-time, 
forward-looking PD, as required by IFRS 9. The Bank performs the following: (1) A point-in-time calibration, where the PD of the portfolio is aligned with the 
appropriate default rate. The resulting PD estimate generally equals the prior-year default rate. The prior-year default rate is selected for the calibration performed 
at this stage, as it often reflects one of the most accurate and appropriate estimates of the current-year default rate; (2) Forward-looking adjustments are 
incorporated through, among other measures, a calibration factor based on forecasts produced by the stress testing team's analyses. The team considers three 
macroeconomic scenarios, and, for each scenario, produces a forward-looking assessment covering the three upcoming years. 
 
LGD Estimates 
The LGD estimation method consists of using, for each of the three macroeconomic scenarios, expected LGD based on the LGD values observed using backtesting, 
the economic LGD estimated and used to calculate economic capital, and lastly, the estimated downturn LGD used to calculate regulatory capital. 
 
EAD Estimates 
For term loans, the Bank uses expected EAD, which is the outstanding balance anticipated at each point in time. Expected EAD decreases over time according to 
contractual repayments and to prepayments. For revolving loans, the EAD percentage is based on the percentage estimated by the corresponding regulatory 
model and, thereafter, is converted to dollars according to the authorized balance.  
 
Expected Life 
For most financial instruments, the expected life used when measuring expected credit losses is the remaining contractual life. For revolving financial instruments 
where there is no contractual maturity, such as credit cards or lines of credit, the expected life is based on the behavioural life of clients who have defaulted or 
closed their account. 
 
Incorporation of Forward-Looking Information  
The Bank’s Economy and Strategy Group is responsible for developing three macroeconomic scenarios and for recommending probability weights for each 
scenario. Macroeconomic scenarios are not developed for specific portfolios, as the Economy and Strategy Group provides a set of variables for each of the 
defined scenarios for the next three years. The PDs are also adjusted to incorporate economic assumptions (interest rates, unemployment rates, GDP forecasts, 
oil prices, housing price indices, etc.) that can be statistically tied to PD changes that will have an impact beyond the next 12 months. These statistical 
relationships are determined using the processes developed for stress testing. In addition, the group considers other relevant factors that may not be adequately 
reflected in the information used to calculate the PDs (including late payments and whether the financial asset is subject to additional monitoring within the 
watchlist process for business and government loan portfolios).  
 
Determination of a Significant Increase in the Credit Risk of a Financial Instrument 
At each reporting period, the Bank determines whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by examining the change in the risk of 
default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. First, the Bank compares the point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD at the 
reporting date with the expected point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD established at initial recognition. Based on this comparison, the Bank 
determines whether the loan has deteriorated when compared to the initial conditions. Because the comparison includes an adjustment based on origination-
date forward-looking information and reporting-date forward-looking information, the deterioration may be caused by the following factors: (i) deterioration of 
the economic outlook used in the forward-looking assessment; (ii) deterioration of the borrower’s conditions (payment defaults, worsening financial ratios, etc.); 
or (iii) a combination of both factors. The quantitative criteria used to determine a significant increase in credit risk are a series of relative and absolute 
thresholds, and a backstop is also applied. All financial instruments that are over 30 days past due but below 90 days past due are migrated to Stage 2, even if 
the other criteria do not indicate a significant increase in credit risk.

(4)  Main stock index in Canada. 
(5)  The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price index is commonly used as a benchmark. 
 
The main macroeconomic factors used for the personal credit portfolio are unemployment rate and housing price index growth, based on the economy of Canada 
or Quebec. The main macroeconomic factors used for the business and government credit portfolio are unemployment rate, BBB spread, S&P/TSX growth, and 
WTI oil price. 
 
An increase in unemployment rate or BBB spread will generally correlate with higher allowances for credit losses, whereas an increase in the other 
macroeconomic factors (GDP growth, S&P/TSX growth, housing price index growth, and WTI oil price) will generally correlate with lower allowances for credit 
losses.

In the normal course of its business, the Bank enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets such as securities or loans directly to third parties, 
in particular structured entities. According to the terms of some of those transactions, the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards related to those 
financial assets. The risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk and other price risks, whereas the rewards include income 
streams associated with the financial assets. As such, those financial assets are not derecognized and the transactions are treated as collateralized or secured 
borrowings. The nature of those transactions is described below.

When securities are sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned under securities lending agreements, the Bank transfers financial assets to third 
parties in accordance with the standard terms for such transactions. These third parties may have an unlimited right to resell or repledge the financial assets 
received. If cash collateral is received, the Bank records the cash along with an obligation to return the cash, which is included in Obligations related to securities 
sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are received as collateral, the Bank does not 
record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program, the Bank sells securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities to Canada Housing 
Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of insured mortgage bonds. Third-party CMB investors have legal recourse only to the transferred 
assets. The cash received for these transferred assets is treated as a secured borrowing, and a corresponding liability is recorded in Liabilities related to 
transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
The following table provides additional information about the nature of the transferred financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition and the associated 
liabilities.

(1)  The amount related to the securities loaned is the maximum amount of Bank securities that can be lent. For the obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, the amount 
includes the Bank’s own financial assets as well as those of third parties. 
(2)  Associated liabilities include obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements before the offsetting impact of $3,166 million as at October 31, 2019 ($287 million as at 
October 31, 2018) and liabilities related to transferred receivables. Liabilities related to securities loaned are not included, as the Bank can lend its own financial assets and those of third 
parties. The carrying value and fair value of liabilities related to securities loaned were $9,753 million as at October 31, 2019 ($7,550 million as at October 31, 2018).

(1)  During fiscal 2018, the Bank had disposed of its entire interest in an unlisted joint venture. 
(2)  The fair value of investments in associates based on quoted prices in active markets was $544 million as at October 31, 2019 ($611 million as at October 31, 2018). 
(3)  The Bank exercises significant influence over TMX Group Limited mainly through its equity interest, debt financing, and presence on TMX Group Limited’s board of directors. As at October 31, 
2019, the Bank’s ownership interest in TMX Group Limited was 8.5%. 
(4)  On May 9, 2019, through one of its subsidiaries, the Bank disposed of 10,680,000 Class A subordinate voting shares of Fiera Capital Corporation (Fiera Capital) at a per-share price of 
$12.00 for gross proceeds of $128 million. Before the transaction, the Bank’s investment in Fiera Capital stood at 18% and was accounted for using the equity method. After the transaction, 
the Bank’s ownership percentage was 7%. A gain on disposal of Fiera Capital shares of $79 million, including a $31 million gain on remeasurement at fair value of the retained interest was 
recognized in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2019 and reported in the Other heading of segment results. After 
the transaction, the Bank designated the 7% retained interest as a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s ownership 
interest in Fiera Capital was 5.0%.  
(5)  On June 30, 2019, the Bank concluded that it had lost significant influence over NSIA Participations (NSIA), an associate entity in the Ivory Coast, and therefore ceased using the equity method 
to account for this investment. The Bank designated its investment in NSIA as a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in an amount of $128 million. 
Following the fair value measurement, a $33 million loss was recorded in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income and reported in the Other heading of 
segment results. As at October 31, 2019, the Bank’s ownership interest in NSIA was 22.1%. 
 
As at October 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no significant restrictions limiting the ability of associates and joint ventures to transfer funds to the Bank in the 
form of dividends or to repay any loans or advances. Furthermore, the Bank has not made any specific commitment or contracted any contingent liability with 
respect to associates or joint ventures.

(2)  On July 30, 2019, the Bank completed the sale of its head office land and building located at 600 De La Gauchetière Street West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for gross proceeds of $187 million. 
At the same time, the Bank entered into a four-year operating lease with the purchaser. This sale-leaseback transaction resulted in a gain of $50 million, which was recognized in the Non-
Interest Income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income and reported in the Other heading of segment results. 
(3)  During the year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank decided to stop using certain computer equipment. Consequently, an amount of $13 million in impairment losses related to this equipment 
was recognized in the Non-interest expenses – Technology item of the Consolidated Statement of Income and reported in the Other heading of segment results.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill resulting from a business combination must be allocated, as of the acquisition date, to a CGU or a group of CGUs 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances 
indicate that the recoverable value of the CGU or group of CGUs may have fallen below its carrying amount. 
 
Goodwill was tested for impairment during the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, and no impairment loss was recognized. 
 
The recoverable value of a CGU or group of CGUs is based on the value in use that is calculated based on discounted pre-tax cash flows. Future pre-tax cash flows 
are estimated based on a five-year period, which is the reference period used for the most recent financial forecasts approved by management. Cash flows 
beyond that period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate. 
 
The discount rate used for each CGU or group of CGUs is calculated using the cost of debt financing and the cost related to the Bank’s equity. This rate corresponds 
to the Bank’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risk specific to the CGU. The long-term growth rate used in calculating discounted cash flow 
estimates is based on the forecasted growth rate plus a risk premium. The rate is constant over the entire five-year period for which the cash flows were 
determined. Growth rates are determined, among other factors, based on past growth rates, economic trends, inflation, competition and the impact of the Bank’s 
strategic initiatives. As at October 31, 2019, for each CGU or CGU group, the discount rate used was 12.9% (12.8% as at October 31, 2018) and the long-term 
growth rate was between 2% and 5%, depending on the CGU, as at October 31, 2019 and 2018. 
 
Estimating a CGU’s value in use requires significant judgment regarding the inputs used in applying the discounted cash flow method. The Bank conducts 
sensitivity analyses by varying the after-tax discount rate upward by 1% and the terminal growth rates down by 1%. Such sensitivity analyses demonstrate that 
a reasonable change in assumptions would not result in a CGU’s carrying value exceeding its value in use.

NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership 
In December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond 
Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold uninsured 
residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. During the year ended October 31, 2019, an amount of 
1.0 billion euros in covered bonds matured, and the Bank issued covered bonds in amounts of US$1.3 billion and 750 million euros (US$750 million in covered 
bonds matured, and the Bank issued covered bonds in an amount of 1.5 billion euros during the year ended October 31, 2018). The covered bonds 
totalled $9.5 billion as at October 31, 2019 ($8.3 billion as at October 31, 2018). For additional information, see Note 27 to these consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
The Bank has limited access to the assets owned by this structured entity according to the terms of the agreements that apply to this transaction. The assets 
owned by this entity totalled $16.5 billion as at October 31, 2019 ($13.2 billion as at October 31, 2018), of which $16.2 billion ($12.9 billion as at 
October 31, 2018) is presented in Residential mortgage loans on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2)  With the prior approval of OSFI, the Bank may, at its option, redeem these notes as of February 1, 2023, in whole or in part, at their nominal value plus accrued and unpaid interest. These 
notes contain non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions and qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III. In the case of a trigger event as defined by OSFI, 
each note will be automatically and immediately converted, on a full and permanent basis, without the consent of the holder, into a specified number of common shares of the Bank as 
determined using an automatic conversion formula with a multiplier of 1.5 and a conversion price based on the greater of: (i) a floor price of $5.00; (ii) the current market price of common 
shares, which represents the volume weighted average price of common shares for the ten trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares 
are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank’s Board. The number of shares issued is determined by 
dividing the par value of the note (plus accrued and unpaid interest on such note) by the conversion price and then applying the multiplier. 
(3)  Debentures denominated in foreign currency totalling US$7 million as at October 31, 2019 (2018: US$7 million) and bearing interest at a rate of 1/8% above six-month LIBOR. 
(4)  The unamortized costs related to the issuance of the subordinated debt represent the initial cost, net of accumulated amortization, calculated using the effective interest rate method.

Derivative financial instruments are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying interest rate, exchange rate, equity price, commodity price, 
credit spread or index. 
 
The main types of derivative financial instruments used are presented below. 
 
FFoorrwwaarrddss  aanndd  FFuuttuurreess  
Forwards and futures are contractual obligations to buy or deliver a specified amount of currency, interest rate, commodity, or financial instrument on a specified 
future date at a specified price. Forwards are tailor-made agreements transacted in the over-the-counter market. Futures are traded on organized exchanges and 
are subject to cash margining calculated daily by clearing houses. 
 
SSwwaappss  
Swaps are over-the-counter contracts in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows. The Bank uses the following types of swap contracts: 
 
  Cross-currency swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed-rate interest payments and principal payments in different currencies. 
  Interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate interest payments based on the notional principal value in the 
same currency. 
  Commodity swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange fixed and floating rate payments based on the notional principal value of a commodity. 
  Equity swaps are transactions in which counterparties agree to exchange the return on one equity or group of equities for a payment based on a benchmark 
interest rate. 
  Credit default swaps are transactions in which one of the parties agrees to pay returns to the other party so that the latter can make a payment if a credit 
event occurs. 
 
OOppttiioonnss    
Options are agreements between two parties in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell, either at a specified 
date or dates or at any time prior to a predetermined expiry date, a specific amount of currency, commodity, or financial instrument at an agreed-upon price upon 
the sale of the option. The writer receives a premium for the sale of this instrument.

CCrreeddiitt  RRiisskk      
Credit risk on derivative financial instruments is the risk of financial loss that the Bank will have to assume if a counterparty fails to honour its contractual 
obligations. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is subject to the same credit approval, credit limit and credit monitoring standards as those 
applied to the Bank’s other credit transactions. Consequently, the Bank evaluates the creditworthiness of counterparties and manages the size of the portfolios 
as well as the diversification and maturity profiles of these financial instruments. 
 
The Bank limits the credit risk of over-the-counter contracts by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and entering into contracts that provide for the exchange 
of collateral between parties where the fair value of the outstanding transactions exceeds an agreed threshold. The Bank also negotiates master netting 
agreements that provide for the simultaneous close-out and settling of all transactions with a given counterparty in the event of default, insolvency, or 
bankruptcy. However, overall exposure to credit risk, reduced through master netting agreements, may change substantially after the balance sheet date because 
it is affected by all transactions subject to a contract as well as by changes in the market rates of the underlying instruments. 
 
The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to have access to established clearing houses in order to minimize the settlement risk arising from financial derivative 
transactions. In some cases, the Bank has direct access to clearing houses for settling derivative financial instruments. In addition, certain derivative financial 
instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties. 
 
In the case of exchange-traded contracts, exposure to credit risk is limited because these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established 
exchanges, each of which is associated with a well-capitalized clearing house that assumes the obligations of both counterparties and guarantees their 
performance obligations. All exchange-traded contracts are subject to initial margins and daily settlement. 
 
TTeerrmmss  UUsseedd  
Replacement Cost 
Replacement cost is the Bank’s maximum credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This amount is 
the positive fair value of all derivative financial instruments, before all master netting agreements and collateral held. 
 
Credit Risk Equivalent 
The credit risk equivalent amount is the total replacement cost plus an amount representing the potential future credit risk exposure, as outlined in OSFI’s Capital 
Adequacy Requirements Guideline. 
 
Risk-Weighted Amount 
The risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the OSFI guidance to the credit risk equivalent.

(1)  The benchmark interest rate reform is a global initiative led and coordinated by central banks and governments around the world, including those in Canada. In July 2017, the UK Financial 
Conduct Committee (FCA) stated that, after 2021, it will no longer compel banks to submit rates used for the calculation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The Bank has formed a 
team that is conducting a Bank-wide impact analysis. It is currently inventorying all of the Bank’s contractual arrangements linked to LIBOR, assessing the Bank’s exposures to LIBOR 
instruments and identifying impacts on the Bank’s products, systems and processes with the intention of minimizing the impacts through appropriate mitigating actions. The Bank is also 
actively involved in industry working groups and will continue to monitor industry progress.  
(2)  As at October 31, 2019, the Bank also designated $958 million in foreign currency deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as net investment hedging instruments ($1,035 million in foreign 
currency deposits denominated in U.S. dollars and euros as net investment hedging instruments as at October 31, 2018).

Fair value hedge transactions consist of using derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps and options) to hedge changes in the fair value of a financial 
asset or financial liability caused by interest rate fluctuations. Changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments 
offset changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to portfolios of securities measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, fixed-rate deposits, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and subordinated debt. 
 
In addition, when a fixed-rate asset or liability is denominated in a foreign currency, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the associated 
foreign exchange risk. The Bank may designate a cross-currency swap to exchange the fixed-rate foreign currency for the functional currency at a floating rate in 
a single hedging relationship addressing both interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange 
risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk 
and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to foreign currency fixed-rate deposits. 
 
Regression analysis is used to test hedge effectiveness and determine the hedge ratio. For fair value hedges, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness 
is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned. 
 
The following tables show amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the fair value hedges.

Cash flow hedge transactions consist of using interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows caused by floating-rate assets or liabilities. 
In addition, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk caused by assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish 
between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy 
mainly to its loan, personal credit line, acceptance, and deposit portfolios.  
 
The Bank also uses total return swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows related to the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan. Some of these swaps are 
designated as part of a cash flow hedge against a portion of the unrecognized obligation of the RSU Plan. In cash flow hedges, the derivative financial instruments 
used as hedging instruments reduce the variability of the future cash flows related to the hedged items. 
 
Regression analysis is used to assess hedge effectiveness and to determine the hedge ratio. For cash flow hedges, the main source of potential hedge 
ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned. 
 
The following tables show the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the cash flow hedges.

The Bank’s structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. The Bank 
measures this risk by assessing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and hedges it using derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (cross-
currency swaps and deposits). In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), the financial instruments used offset the foreign 
exchange gains and losses on the investments. When non-derivative financial instruments are designated as foreign exchange risk hedges, only the changes in 
fair value that are attributable to foreign exchange risk are taken into account when assessing and calculating the effectiveness of the hedge.  
 
Assessing the effectiveness of net investment hedges consists of comparing changes in the carrying value of the deposits or the fair value of the derivative 
attributable to exchange rate fluctuations with changes in the net investment in a foreign operation attributable to exchange rate fluctuations. Inasmuch as the 
notional amount of the hedging instruments and the hedged net investments are aligned, no ineffectiveness is expected. 
 
The following tables present the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the net investment hedges.

(1)  Redeemable in cash at the Bank’s option, in whole or in part, subject to the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) and to OSFI approval. Redemption prices are increased by all the declared 
and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares to the date fixed for redemption. 
(2)  Convertible at the option of the holders of first preferred shares, subject to certain conditions. 
(3)  The dividends are non-cumulative and payable quarterly, except for Series 23, for which the dividends are payable semi-annually. 
(4)  Upon the occurrence of a trigger event as defined by OSFI, each outstanding preferred share will be automatically and immediately converted, on a full and permanent basis, without the 
consent of the holder, into a number of common shares of the Bank determined pursuant to an automatic conversion formula. This conversion will be calculated by dividing the value of the 
preferred shares, i.e., $25.00 per share, plus all declared and unpaid dividends as at the date of the trigger event, by the value of the common shares. The value of the common shares will 
be the greater of a $5.00 floor price or the current market price of the common shares. Current market price means the volume weighted average trading price of common shares for the ten 
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the price 
will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank’s Board. 
(5)  Redeemable on the date fixed for redemption and on the same date every five years thereafter. 
(6)  Convertible on the date fixed for conversion and on the same date every five years thereafter, subject to certain conditions. 
(7)  The dividend amount is set for the five-year period commencing on May 16, 2019 and ending on the date fixed for redemption. Thereafter, these shares carry a non-cumulative quarterly fixed 
dividend in an amount per share determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the sum of the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield on the applicable fixed-rate calculation date 
by $25.00, plus the reset premium. 
(8)  The dividend amount is set for the initial period ending on the date fixed for redemption. Thereafter, these shares carry a non-cumulative quarterly fixed dividend in an amount per share 
determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the sum of the 5-year Government of Canada bond yield on the applicable fixed-rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset premium. 
(9)  For additional information, see Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements.  
(10)  As of the date fixed for redemption, and every five years thereafter, the redemption price will be $25.00 per share.  
(11)  The dividend period begins as of the date fixed for redemption. The amount of the floating quarterly non-cumulative dividend is determined by multiplying the rate of interest equal to the 
sum of the 90-day Government of Canada treasury bill yield on the floating rate calculation date by $25.00, plus the reset premium. 
(12)  As of the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price will be $25.50 per share. Thereafter, on the same date every five years, the redemption price will be $25.00 per share.

On June 10, 2019, the Bank began a normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 6,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 1.80% 
of its outstanding common shares) over the 12-month period ending no later than June 9, 2020. On June 6, 2018, the Bank had begun a normal course issuer 
bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 8,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 2.36% of its outstanding common shares) over the 12-month 
period ended June 5, 2019. Any repurchase through the Toronto Stock Exchange will be done at market prices. The common shares may also be repurchased 
through other means authorized by the Toronto Stock Exchange and applicable regulations, including private agreements or share repurchase programs under 
issuer bid exemption orders issued by the securities regulators. A private purchase made under an exemption order issued by a securities regulator will be done 
at a discount to the prevailing market price. The amounts that are paid above the average book value of the common shares are charged to Retained earnings. 
During the year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank repurchased 4,547,200 common shares for $281 million, which reduced Common share capital by $40 million 
and Retained earnings by $241 million. During the year ended October 31, 2018, the Bank had repurchased 7,500,000 common shares for $467 million, which

As part of the acquisition of Wellington West Holdings Inc. in 2011, the Bank had issued common shares held in escrow. In December 2016, a total of 799,563 
of these shares were released to shareholders, and 108,341 shares were cancelled, mainly upon the settlement of certain indemnifications guaranteed by those 
shares. During the year ended October 31, 2019, a total of 870 of these shares were released to shareholders, and 1,517 shares were cancelled (during the year 
ended October 31, 2018, a total of 3,778 of these shares were released, and 1,206 shares were cancelled). As at October 31, 2019, the number of common 
shares held in escrow was 21,510 (23,897 as at October 31, 2018). The Bank expects that the remaining shares in escrow will be settled by the end of calendar

The Bank is prohibited from declaring dividends on its common or preferred shares if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Bank would, by so 
doing, be in contravention of the regulations of the Bank Act (Canada) or OSFI’s capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. In addition, the ability to pay common 
share dividends is restricted by the terms of the outstanding preferred shares pursuant to which the Bank may not pay dividends on its common shares without 
the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares, unless all preferred share dividends have been declared and paid or set aside for payment. 
Moreover, if NBC Asset Trust were unable to pay the full amount of distributions on the trust units, the Bank would withhold from declaring dividends on any of 
its preferred and common shares during a determined period. For additional information, see Notes 19 and 27 to these consolidated financial statements.

The Bank has a dividend reinvestment plan for common and preferred shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional. Under the terms and conditions of the 
plan, participants acquire shares through the reinvestment of cash dividends paid on the shares they hold or through optional cash payments. Common shares 
subscribed by participants are purchased on their behalf in the secondary market through the Bank’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, 
at a price equal to the average purchase price of the common shares during the ten business days immediately following the dividend payment date.

Through structured entity NBC Asset Trust (the Trust), a closed-end trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario, the Bank issued transferable non-
voting trust units called “Trust Capital Securities” or “NBC CapS II.” These securities are not redeemable or exchangeable for Bank preferred shares at the option 
of the holder. The gross proceeds from the issuance were used by the Trust to finance the acquisition of mortgage loans from the Bank. For additional information, 
see Note 27 to these consolidated financial statements. 
 
The main terms and characteristics of the NBC CapS II trust units outstanding as at October 31, 2019 are presented below. 
  
Semi-annual 
distribution 
Number  Issuance date  Annual yield  Distribution dates  by NBC CapS II(1) 
June 30, 
Series 2  350,000  June 30, 2008  7.447 %  December 31  $37.235(2) 
 
(1)  For each unit with a face value of $1,000. 
(2)  For each distribution date after June 30, 2020, the distribution will be paid at a rate equal to one-half the sum of the 180-day bankers’ acceptance rate in effect plus 4.09%. 
 
Distribution 
No cash distributions will be payable by the Trust on NBC CapS II if the Bank fails to declare regular dividends on its preferred shares or, if no preferred shares 
are then outstanding, on its outstanding common shares. In this case, the net distributable funds of the Trust will be paid to the Bank as the sole holder of the 
special trust securities, representing the residual interest in the Trust. Should the Trust fail to pay the semi-annual distributions in full on the NBC CapS II, the 
Bank will withhold from declaring dividends on any of its preferred and common shares during a determined period. 
 
Automatic Exchange 
Each NBC CapS II – Series 2 can be exchanged automatically, without the consent of the holders, for 40 Series 23 First Preferred Shares of the Bank upon the 
occurrence of one of the following events: (i) proceedings are commenced for the winding-up of the Bank; (ii) OSFI takes control of the Bank; (iii) the Bank posts 
a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 5% or a Total capital ratio of less than 8%; or (iv) OSFI has directed the Bank to increase its capital or to provide additional 
liquidity and the Bank elects such automatic exchange or the Bank fails to comply with such direction to the satisfaction of OSFI. On an automatic exchange, the 
Bank will hold all outstanding trust capital securities of the Trust. 
 
Redemption at the Option of the Trust 
On any distribution date, the Trust may, subject to prior written notice and OSFI approval, redeem, at its option, the NBC CapS II – Series 2, in whole but not in 
part, without the consent of the holders.  
 
Purchase for Cancellation 
The Trust may, with OSFI approval, purchase NBC CapS II – Series 2, in whole or in part, on the open market or by tender or private contract at any price. The NBC 
CapS II purchased by the Trust, if any, will be cancelled and will not be reissued. 
 
Regulatory Capital 
The NBC CapS II – Series 2 qualify as innovative capital instruments and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do not satisfy 
the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be phased out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022.

Capital management has a dual role of ensuring a competitive return to the Bank’s shareholders while maintaining a solid capital foundation that covers the 
risks inherent to the Bank’s business, supports its business segments and protects its clients.

process. This process is a key tool in establishing the Bank’s capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments. 
  
CCaappiittaall  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  
Capital ratios are obtained by dividing regulatory capital by risk-weighted assets and are expressed as a percentage. Risk-weighted assets are calculated in 
accordance with the rules established by OSFI for on- and off-balance-sheet risks. Credit, market and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets 
calculation for regulatory purposes. The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, intangible assets and other capital deductions. The Additional Tier 
1 instruments comprise eligible non-cumulative preferred shares and the eligible amount of innovative instruments. The sum of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital 
forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of the eligible portion of subordinated debt and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory 
capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
 
The Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 capital 
ratio of at least 11.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 13.5%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, a 1% surcharge applicable 
solely to D-SIBs, and a 2.0% domestic stability buffer. The domestic stability buffer, which can vary from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively 
of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement will not be subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but will have to 
provide a remediation plan to OSFI. The banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II standardized 
approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 75% of the capital requirements as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to risk-
weighted assets. OSFI requires Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is 
calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative 
exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total 
exposure.  
 
During the years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI’s regulatory capital requirements.

The Bank’s Stock Option Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this plan, options are awarded annually and 
provide participants with the right to purchase common shares at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange on the day preceding the award. The options vest evenly over a four-year period and expire ten years from the award date or, in certain circumstances 
set out in the plan, within specified time limits. The Stock Option Plan contains provisions for retiring employees that allow the participant’s rights to continue 
vesting in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement. The maximum number of common shares that may be issued under the Stock Option Plan 
was 20,377,278 as at October 31, 2019 (22,894,802 as at October 31, 2018). The number of common shares reserved for a participant may not exceed 5% of 
the total number of Bank shares issued and outstanding.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily representative of how options will be exercised in the future. Expected volatility 
is extrapolated from the implied volatility of the Bank’s share price and observable market inputs, which are not necessarily representative of actual results. The 
expected dividend yield represents the annualized dividend divided by the Bank’s share price at the award date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the 
Canadian dollar swap curve at the award date. The exercise price is equal to the Bank’s share price at the award date. No other market parameter has been 
included in the fair value measurement of the options. 
 
The compensation expense recorded for this plan for the year ended October 31, 2019 was $11 million ($12 million for the year ended October 31, 2018).

The DSU Plans are for officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries as well as directors. These plans allow the Bank to tie a portion of 
the value of the compensation of participants to the future value of the Bank’s common shares. A DSU is a right that has a value equal to the closing price of a 
common share of the Bank on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the award. DSUs generally vest evenly over four years. Additional DSUs are 
credited to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to the dividends declared on Bank common shares and vest evenly over the same period as the 
reference DSUs. DSUs may only be cashed when participants retire or leave the Bank or, for directors, when their term ends. The DSU Plans contain provisions 
for retiring employees whereby participants may continue vesting units in accordance with the stated terms of the grant agreement.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank awarded 51,839 DSUs at a weighted average price of $60.33 (44,713 DSUs at a weighted average price of

The RSU Plan is for certain officers and other designated persons of the Bank and its subsidiaries. The objective of this plan is to ensure that the compensation 
of certain officers and other designated persons is competitive and to foster retention. An RSU represents a right that has a value equal to the average closing 
price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December. RSUs 
generally vest evenly over three years, although some RSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the third year following the date of the award, the 
date on which all RSUs expire. Additional RSUs are credited to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to the dividends declared on the Bank common 
shares and vest evenly over the same period as the reference RSUs. The RSU Plan contains provisions for retiring employees whereby participants may continue

The PSU Plan is for officers and other designated persons of the Bank. The objective of this plan is to tie a portion of the value of the compensation of these

price of the Bank’s common share, as published by the Toronto Stock Exchange, over the ten trading days preceding the sixth business day in December, adjusted 
upward or downward according to performance criteria, which is based on the Bank’s total shareholder return (TSR) growth index over three years compared to 
the average TSR growth index of the comparator group composed of Canadian banks over three years. PSUs vest on the sixth business day of December of the 
third year following the date of the award, the date on which all PSUs expire. Additional PSUs are credited to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to 
the dividends declared on the Bank’s common shares and vest evenly over the same period as the reference PSUs. The PSU Plan contains provisions for retiring 
employees whereby participants may continue vesting units in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.

This plan is exclusively for key employees of NBF Wealth Management. The purpose of this plan is to foster the retention of key employees and promote the 
growth in income and the continuous improvement in profitability at Wealth Management. Under this plan, participants can defer a portion of their annual 
compensation, and NBF may pay a contribution to key employees when certain financial objectives are met. Amounts awarded by NBF and the compensation 
deferred by participants are invested in, among others, Bank common share units. These share units represent a right, the value of which corresponds to the 
closing price of the Bank’s common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the award date. Additional units are paid to the accounts of participants in an 
amount equal to the dividends declared on Bank common shares. Share units representing the amounts awarded by NBF vest evenly over four years. When a 
participant retires, or in certain cases when the participant’s employment is terminated, the participant receives a cash amount representing the value of the 
vested share units.  
 
During the year ended October 31, 2019, NBF awarded 147,927 share units at a weighted average price of $59.94 (132,544 share units at a weighted average

Under the Bank’s Employee Share Ownership Plan, employees who meet the eligibility criteria can contribute up to 8% of their annual gross salary by way of 
payroll deductions. The Bank matches 25% of the employee contribution up to a maximum of $1,500 per annum. Bank contributions vest to the employee after 
one year of uninterrupted participation in the plan. Subsequent contributions vest immediately. The Bank’s contributions, amounting to $12 million for the year 
ended October 31, 2019 ($9 million for the year ended October 31, 2018), were charged to Compensation and employee benefits when paid. As at October 31, 
2019, a total of 5,813,172 common shares were held for this plan (5,718,242 common shares as at October 31, 2018). 
 
Plan shares are purchased on the open market and are considered to be outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Dividends paid on the Bank’s common 
shares held for the Employee Share Ownership Plan are used to purchase other common shares on the open market.

The Bank offers defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans to eligible employees. The pension plans provide benefits based on 
years of plan participation and average earnings at retirement. The other post-employment benefit plans include post-retirement medical, dental and life 
insurance coverage. The pension plans are funded whereas the other plans are not funded. The fair value of plan assets and the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation are measured as at October 31. 
 
The Bank’s most significant pension plan is the Employee Pension Plan of the National Bank of Canada; it is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency 
and subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the Income Tax Act. 
 
The defined benefit plans expose the Bank to specific risks such as investment performance, changes to the discount rate used to calculate the obligation, the 
longevity of plan members and future inflation. While management believes that the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation process are reasonable, there 
remains a degree of risk and uncertainty that may cause future results to differ significantly from these assumptions, which could give rise to gains or losses. 
 
According to the Bank’s governance rules, the policies and risk management related to the defined benefit plans are overseen at different levels by the pension 
committees, the Bank’s management and the Board’s Human Resources Committee. The defined benefit plans are examined on an ongoing basis in order to 
monitor the funding and investment policies, the plans’ financial status and the Bank’s funding requirements. 
 
The Bank’s funding policy for the defined benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by pension regulators.  
 
For funded plans, the Bank determines whether an economic benefit exists in the form of potential reductions in future contributions and in the form of refunds 
from the plan surplus, where permitted by applicable regulations and plan provisions.

The Bank’s investment strategy for plan assets considers several factors, including the time horizon of pension plan obligations and investment risk. For each 
plan, an allocation range per asset class is defined using a mix of equity and debt securities to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets and minimize 
asset/liability mismatching. 
 
The pension plan assets may include investment securities issued by the Bank. As at October 31, 2019 and 2018, the pension plan assets do not include any 
securities issued by the Bank. 
 
For fiscal 2019, the Bank and its related entities received $3 million ($5 million in fiscal 2018) in fees from the pension plans for related management, 
administration and custodial services.

Discount Rate 
The discount rate assumption is based on an interest rate curve that represents the yields on corporate AA bonds. Short-term maturities are obtained using a 
curve based on observed data from corporate AA bonds. Long-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data and extrapolated data. 
 
To measure the pension plan and other post-employment plan obligation, the vested benefits that the Bank expects to pay in each future period are discounted 
to the measurement date using the spot rate associated with each of the respective periods based on the yield curve derived using the above methodology. The 
sum of discounted benefit amounts represents the defined benefit obligation. An average discount rate that replicates this obligation is then computed.  
 
To better reflect current service cost, a separate discount rate was determined to account for the timing of future benefit payments associated with the additional 
year of service to be earned by the plan’s active participants. Since these benefits are, on average, being paid at a later date than the benefits already earned by 
participants as a whole (i.e., longer duration), this method results in the use of a generally higher discount rate for calculating current service cost than that used 
to measure obligations where the yield curve is positively sloped. The methodology used to determine this discount rate is the same as the one used to establish 
the discount rate for measuring the obligation. 
 
Other Assumptions 
For measurement purposes, the estimated annual growth rate for health care costs was 5.17% as at October 31, 2019 (5.23% as at October 31, 2018). Based 
on the assumption retained, this rate is expected to decrease gradually to 3.50% in 2038 and remain steady thereafter.  
 
Mortality assumptions are a determining factor when measuring the defined benefit obligation. Determining the expected benefit payout period is based on best 
estimate assumptions regarding mortality. Mortality tables are reviewed at least once a year, and the assumptions made are in accordance with accepted 
actuarial practice. New results regarding the plans are reviewed and used in calculating best estimates of future mortality.

According to forecasts, which are based on information available on October 31, 2019, the Bank believes that it is probable that the results of future operations 
will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize all the deferred tax assets before they expire. 
  
As at October 31, 2019, the total amount of temporary differences, unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset has 
been recognized was $508 million ($369 million as at October 31, 2018). 
 
As at October 31, 2019, the total amount of temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures for which no deferred

In June 2019, the Bank was reassessed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for additional income tax and interest of approximately $150 million (including 
estimated provincial tax and interest) in respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during 2014.   
 
In prior fiscal years, the Bank was reassessed for additional income tax and interest of approximately $220 million (including provincial tax and interest) in 
respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank during the 2013 and 2012 taxation years. 
 
The transactions to which the above-mentioned reassessments relate are similar to those prospectively addressed by income tax legislation enacted as a result 
of the 2015 Canadian federal budget. 
 
The CRA may issue reassessments to the Bank for taxation years subsequent to 2014 in regard to activities similar to those that were the subject of the 
above-mentioned reassessments. The Bank remains confident that its tax position was appropriate and intends to vigorously defend its position. As a result, no 
amount has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2019.

In the normal course of business, the Bank issues letters of guarantee. These letters of guarantee represent irrevocable commitments that the Bank will make 
payments in the event that a client cannot meet its financial obligations to third parties. The Bank’s policy for requiring collateral security with respect to letters 
of guarantee is similar to that for loans. Generally, the term of these letters of guarantee is less than two years.

Facilities to Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing asset-backed commercial paper. 
The Bank provides backstop liquidity facilities to these multi-seller conduits. As at October 31, 2019, the notional amount of the global-style backstop liquidity 
facilities totalled $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion as at October 31, 2018), representing the total amount of the commercial paper outstanding.  
 
These backstop liquidity facilities can be drawn if the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market, even if there is no general market disruption. 
These facilities have terms of less than one year and can be periodically renewed. The terms and conditions of these backstop liquidity facilities do not require 
the Bank to advance money to the conduits if the conduits are insolvent or involved in bankruptcy proceedings or to fund non-performing assets beyond the 
amount of the available credit enhancements. The backstop liquidity facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn to date.

The Bank also provides credit enhancement facilities to these multi-seller conduits. These facilities have terms of less than one year and are automatically 
renewable unless the Bank sends a non-renewal notice. As at October 31, 2019 and 2018, the committed notional value for these facilities was $30 million. To 
date, the credit enhancement facilities provided by the Bank have not been drawn. 
 
The maximum risk of loss for the Bank cannot exceed the total amount of commercial paper outstanding, i.e., $2.6 billion as at October 31, 2019 ($2.6 billion 
as at October 31, 2018). As at October 31, 2019, the Bank held $13 million ($7 million as at October 31, 2018) of this commercial paper and, consequently, the 
maximum potential amount of future payments was $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion as at October 31, 2018). 
 
CDCC Overnight Liquidity Facility 
Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC) acts as a central clearing counterparty for multiple financial instrument transactions in Canada. Certain fixed-
income clearing members of CDCC have provided an equally shared committed and uncommitted global overnight liquidity facility for the purpose of supporting 
CDCC in its clearing activities of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements or sold under repurchase agreements. The objective of this facility 
is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event of a clearing member’s default. As a fixed-income clearing member providing support to CDCC, the Bank provides 
a liquidity facility. As at October 31, 2019, the notional amount of the overnight uncommitted liquidity facility amounted to $3.0 billion ($2.3 billion as at October 
31, 2018). As at October 31, 2019 and 2018, no amount had been drawn.

Under securities lending agreements the Bank has entered into with certain clients who have entrusted it with the safekeeping of their securities, the Bank lends 
the securities to third parties and indemnifies its clients in the event of loss. In order to protect itself against any contingent loss, the Bank obtains, as security 
from the borrower, a cash amount or extremely liquid marketable securities with a fair value greater than that of the securities loaned. No amount has been 
recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to potential indemnities resulting from securities lending agreements.

In the normal course of business, including securitization transactions and discontinuances of businesses and operations, the Bank enters into numerous 
contractual agreements under which it undertakes to compensate the counterparty for costs incurred as a result of litigation, changes in laws and regulations 
(including tax legislation), claims with respect to past performance, incorrect representations or the non-performance of certain restrictive covenants. The Bank 
also undertakes to indemnify any person acting as a director or officer or performing a similar function within the Bank or one of its subsidiaries or another entity, 
at the request of the Bank, for all expenses incurred by that person in proceedings or investigations to which he or she is party in that capacity. Moreover, as a 
member of a securities transfer network and pursuant to the membership agreement and the regulations governing the operation of the network, the Bank 
granted collateral in favour of the Bank of Canada to guarantee any obligation of the Bank towards the Bank of Canada that could result from the Bank’s 
participation in the securities transfer network. The durations of the indemnification agreements vary according to circumstance; as at October 31, 2019 and 
2018, given the nature of the agreements, the Bank is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential liability it could be required to pay to 
counterparties. No amount has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to these agreements.

The Bank has a 24.9% equity interest in Maple Financial Group Inc. (Maple), a privately owned Canadian company that operated through direct and indirect 
wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
  
Maple Bank GmbH (Maple GmbH), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Maple, has been the subject of an investigation into alleged tax irregularities by German 
prosecutors since September 2015 and, to the Bank’s knowledge, that investigation is ongoing. The Bank understands that the investigation is focusing on 
selected trading activities by Maple GmbH and some of its former employees, primarily during taxation years 2006 to 2010. The German authorities have alleged 
that these trading activities, often referred to as “cum/ex trading,” violated German tax laws. Neither the Bank nor its employees were involved in these trading 
activities and, to the Bank’s knowledge, are not the subject of this investigation. At that time, the Bank announced that if it were determined that portions of the 
dividends it received from Maple could be reasonably attributed to tax fraud by Maple GmbH, arrangements would be made to repay those amounts to the 
relevant authority. 
 
On February 6, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple GmbH preventing it 
from carrying out its normal business activities. In August 2016, Maple filed for bankruptcy under applicable Canadian laws, and a trustee was appointed to 
administer the company. Similar proceedings were initiated for each of Maple’s other material subsidiaries in their home jurisdictions. In light of the situation, 
the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity interest in Maple in an amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income taxes) during the first quarter of 
2016. The $164 million write-off of the equity interest in this associate was recognized in the Non-interest income – Other item of the Consolidated Statement 
of Income for the year ended October 31, 2016 and was reported in the Financial Markets segment. 
 
While there has not yet been a determination of tax fraud on the part of Maple GmbH or its employees, in the insolvency proceedings of Maple GmbH the German 
finance office issued a declaration about the result of the tax audit at Maple GmbH and about the relevant tax consequences of the cum/ex trading and concluded 
a final tax claim of the tax authorities against the insolvency administrator. This claim was approved by the Maple GmbH creditor assembly.   
 
The Bank has been in contact with the German prosecutors, who have confirmed that, in their view based upon the evidence they have considered since the 
occurrence of the insolvency, the Bank was not involved in any respect with the alleged tax fraud undertaken by Maple GmbH nor was it negligent in failing to 
identify that alleged fraud. Further to discussions between the Bank and the German prosecutors concerning the amounts deemed attributable to the alleged 
tax fraud, the Bank paid 7.7 million euros to the German tax authorities on November 19, 2019. 
 
The Bank has been engaging in discussions with the bankruptcy and insolvency administrators of relevant Maple entities regarding potential claims they may 
assert against Maple’s former shareholders in relation to the insolvency of Maple and its subsidiaries. The Bank does not see a legal basis for any such liability 
but is nevertheless continuing discussions at this time. If any payments are required, they are not expected to be material to the Bank’s financial position.

In the normal course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims relating, among other matters, to loan portfolios, investment 
portfolios and supplier agreements, including court proceedings, investigations or claims of a regulatory nature, class actions or other legal remedies of varied 
natures.  
 
More specifically, the Bank is involved as a defendant in class actions instituted by consumers contesting, inter alia, certain transaction fees or who wish to avail 
themselves of certain legislative provisions relating to consumer protection. The recent developments in the main legal proceedings involving the Bank are as 
follows: 
 
Watson 
In 2011, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa Corporation Canada (Visa) and MasterCard International Incorporated 
(MasterCard) (the Networks) as well as National Bank and a number of other Canadian financial institutions. A similar action was also initiated in Quebec, Ontario, 
Alberta and Saskatchewan. In each of the actions, the Networks and financial institutions are alleged to have been involved in a price-fixing system to maintain 
and increase the fees paid by merchants on transactions executed using the credit cards of the Networks. In so doing, they would notably be in breach of the 
Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. In 2017, a settlement was reached with the plaintiffs; in 2018 
it was approved by the trial courts in each of the five jurisdictions where the action was initiated. The rulings approving the settlement are now the subject of 
appeal proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. 
 
Defrance 
On January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating 
application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-
sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer 
Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages. 
 
It is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based 
on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a 
material impact on the Bank’s consolidated results of operation for a particular period, it would not have a material adverse impact on the Bank’s consolidated 
financial position.

A structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant 
factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means 
of contractual arrangements. Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting treatment described in Note 1. The Bank’s 
maximum exposure to loss resulting from its interests in these structured entities consists primarily of the investments in these entities, the fair value of 
derivative financial instrument contracts entered into with them, and the backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities granted to certain structured 
entities.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities, including commercial loans, reverse 
repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the 
counterparty credit risk of the structured entities, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither power 
nor significant variable returns resulting from financing transactions with structured entities and does not consolidate such entities. Financing transactions with 
third-party-sponsored structured entities are included in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and are not included in the table accompanying this note.

Multi-Seller Conduits 
The Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the 
assets acquired. Clients use these multi-seller conduits to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial 
assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The 
Bank acts as a financial agent and provides these conduits with administrative and transaction structuring services as well as backstop liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Note 26. The Bank has concluded derivative financial 
instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the Bank has the ability to 
direct the relevant activities of these conduits, it cannot use its power to affect the amount of the returns it obtains, as it acts as an agent. Consequently, the 
Bank does not control these conduits and does not consolidate them.   
 
Investment Funds 
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in certain 
investment funds as part of its investing activities. In addition, the Bank is sponsor and investment manager of mutual funds in which it has insignificant or no 
interest. The Bank does not control the funds where its holdings are not significant as in these circumstances, the Bank either acts only as an agent or does not 
have any power over the relevant activities. In both cases, it does not have significant exposure to the variable returns of the funds.  Therefore, the Bank does 
not consolidate these funds. 
 
Private Investments 
As part of its investment banking operations, the Bank invests in several limited liability partnerships and other incorporated entities. These investment 
companies in turn invest in operating companies with a view to reselling these investments at a profit over the medium or long term. The Bank does not intervene 
in the operations of these entities; its only role is that of an investor. Consequently, it does not control these companies and does not consolidate them.   
 
Asset-Backed Structured Entities 
The Bank invested in certain asset-backed structured entities. The underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans and 
leases. The Bank does not have the ability to direct the relevant activities of these structured entities and has no exposure to their variable returns, other than 
the right to receive interest income and dividend income from its investments. Consequently, the Bank does not control these structured entities and does not 
consolidate them.

Securitization Entity for the Bank’s Credit Card Receivables 
In April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its credit card securitization program on a revolving basis and to use the entity 
for capital management and funding purposes.  
 
The Bank provides first-loss protection against the losses since it retains the excess spread from the portfolio of sold receivables. The excess spread represents 
the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid. The Bank also provides second-loss protection as it holds 
subordinated notes issued by CCCT II. In addition, the Bank acts as an administrative agent and servicer and as such is responsible for the daily administration 
and management of CCCT II’s credit card receivables. The Bank therefore has the ability to direct the relevant activities of CCCT II and can exercise its power to 
affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls CCCT II and consolidates it. 
 
Investment Funds  
The Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. 
The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in certain 
investment funds as part of its investing activities. The Bank controls the relevant activities of these funds through its involvement as an investor and its 
significant exposure to their variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates these funds.

Covered Bonds 
NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership 
In December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond 
Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold uninsured 
residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. The Bank acts as manager of the partnership and has 
decision-making authority over its relevant activities in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program. In addition, the 
Bank is able, in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program, to affect the variable returns of the partnership, which 
are directly related to the return on the mortgage loan portfolio and the interest on the loans from the Bank. Consequently, the Bank controls the partnership 
and consolidates it. 
 
NBC Asset Trust 
The Bank created NBC Asset Trust for its funding and capital management needs. The securities issued by this trust constitute innovative capital instruments 
and are eligible as additional Tier 1 capital, but because these instruments do not satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they are to be phased 
out at a rate of 10% per year between 2013 and 2022. For additional information, see Note 19 to these consolidated financial statements. The issuance proceeds 
were used to acquire, from the Bank, residential mortgage loans. The Bank continues to administer these loans and is committed to repurchase from NBC Asset 
Trust the capital balance and unpaid accrued interest on any loan that is more than 90 days past due. The Bank also manages day-to-day operations and holds 
the special voting securities of the trust. After the distribution has been paid to the holders of the trust capital securities, the Bank, as the sole holder of the 
special trust securities, is entitled to receive the balance of net residual funds. Therefore, the Bank has the ability to direct the relevant activities of NBC Asset 
Trust and can use its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls this trust and consolidates it. 
 
Third-Party Structured Entities 
In 2018, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, provided financing to a third-party structured entity in exchange for a 100% interest in a loan portfolio, the 
sole asset held by that entity. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the structured entity, as it has the ability to direct the entity’s relevant activities 
through its involvement in the decision-making process. The Bank is also exposed to the entity’s variable returns. 
 
The following table presents the Bank’s investments and other assets in the consolidated structured entities as well as the total assets of these entities.

The following tables present balance sheet items and off-balance-sheet commitments by residual contractual maturity as at October 31, 2019 and 2018. The 
information gathered from this maturity analysis is a component of liquidity and funding management. However, this maturity profile does not represent how 
the Bank manages its interest rate risk nor its liquidity risk and funding needs. The Bank considers factors other than contractual maturity in the assessment of 
liquid assets or in determining expected future cash flows.  
 
In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the funding needs of its 
clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn.  
 
The Bank also has future minimum commitments under leases for premises as well for other contracts, mainly commitments to purchase loans and contracts for 
outsourced information technology services. Most of the lease commitments are related to operating leases.

The Bank carries out its activities in four business segments, which are defined below. For presentation purposes, other activities are grouped in the Other 
heading. Each reportable segment is distinguished by services offered, type of clientele and marketing strategy. 
 
The presentation of segment disclosures is consistent with the presentation adopted by the Bank for the year beginning November 1, 2018. This presentation 
reflects the fact that advisor banking service activities, which had previously been presented in the Wealth Management segment, are now presented in the 
Personal and Commercial segment. The Bank made this change to better align the monitoring of its activities with its management structure. 
 
PPeerrssoonnaall  aanndd  CCoommmmeerrcciiaall    
The Personal and Commercial segment encompasses the banking, financing, and investing services offered to individuals, advisors and businesses as well as 
insurance operations. 
 
WWeeaalltthh  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  
The Wealth Management segment comprises investment solutions, trust services, banking services, lending services and other wealth management solutions 
offered through internal and third-party distribution networks. 
  
FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMaarrkkeettss  
The Financial Markets segment encompasses corporate banking and investment banking and financial solutions for large and mid-size corporations, public 
sector organizations, and institutional investors. The segment is also active in proprietary trading and investment activities for the Bank. 
 
UU..SS..  SSppeecciiaallttyy  FFiinnaannccee  aanndd  IInntteerrnnaattiioonnaall  ((UUSSSSFF&&II))    
The USSF&I segment encompasses the specialty finance expertise provided by subsidiary Credigy; the activities of subsidiary ABA Bank, which offers financial 
products and services to individuals and businesses in Cambodia; and the activities of targeted investments in certain emerging markets. 
  
OOtthheerr  
This heading encompasses treasury activities, liquidity management, Bank funding, asset/liability management activities, certain non-recurring items and the 
unallocated portion of corporate units. 
 
The segment disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements, except 
for the net interest income, non-interest income and income taxes (recovery) of the operating segments, which are presented on a taxable equivalent basis. 
Taxable equivalent basis is a calculation method that consists in grossing up certain tax-exempt income by the amount of income tax that would have otherwise 
been payable. The effect of these adjustments is reversed under the Other heading. Operations support charges are allocated to each operating segment 
presented in the business segment results. The Bank assesses performance based on the net income attributable to the Bank’s shareholders. Intersegment 
revenues are recognized at the exchange amount. Segment assets correspond to average assets used in segment operations.

On November 19, 2019, the Bank paid 7.7 million euros to the German tax authorities in relation to the Maple case. This payment was made upon a final tax
