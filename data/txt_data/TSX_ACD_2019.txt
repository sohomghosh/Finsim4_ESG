Letter to Our Shareholders
This time last year we had just closed the books on 2018, Accord’s best year
ever. I wrote about our long-time pattern of evolution, specifically Accord’s 
five-year transformation into a multi-faceted, dynamic commercial finance
company, positioned to confidently lend up and down a company’s balance
sheet. After years of acquisitions, product development and key hires, we 
powered through 2019 with all the puzzle pieces in place. 
Our focus for 2019 was to pull our complementary businesses into a unified
commercial finance powerhouse aligned around a singular mission: to simplify
access to capital so our clients can thrive. Given Accord’s dramatic evolution,
from receivables finance to broad-based commercial finance, our presentation
to key markets was less than consistent, and certainly not simple. We made 
terrific strides in this regard, embarking on a three-year plan to modernize key
functions, built out core teams, and streamline the way we engage with our most
important markets. While still in the early stages, our “collection of boutiques”
Simon Hitzig is combining neatly into a cohesive platform, with the aim to deliver seamless
service from first point of contact through the life of each client relationship. 
While I am pleased to report this progress in executing our business strategy,
our 2019 financial results fell short of expectations. We booked a significant 
account write-down in the fourth quarter, which brought full year earnings
lower compared to 2018. The provision for losses is one of three key figures 
we keep a close eye on, I'll touch on all three here.
The overall loan portfolio saw strong growth, with total funds employed of
$373 million at year end. Average funds employed over the year reached an
all-time high of $378 million; this is the key number, along with average yield, that
drives revenue. Not surprisingly, revenue also hit an all-time high of $56 million.
This top line performance was strong proof that our strategic plan is working. 
Less prominent in our financial statements is Accord’s steadily improving 
operating efficiency. We closely monitor our general and administrative expenses
Ken Hitzig
as a percentage of total revenues, which providesa measure of how efficient we
are at managing a growing business. Better operating efficiency means we convert
a greater percentage of revenue to shareholder earnings as the portfolio grows.
Three years ago, in 2016, we spent 62% of revenue on overhead. In 2019 that
number declined to 48%. Scale is important in this business, and we continue
to make progress on that front.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
1.   Description of the business
        Accord Financial Corp. (the “Company”) is incorporated by way of Articles 
         of Continuance under the Ontario Business Corporations Act and, through
        its subsidiaries, is engaged in providing factoring, financing, leasing, credit
        investigation, credit protection and receivables management, to industrial
        and commercial enterprises, principally in Canada and the United States.
        The Company's registered office is at 40 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 602, 
        Toronto, Ontario, Canada
2.  Basis of presentation and statement of compliance
          These consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars,
        the Company’s functional and presentation currency, and are prepared in
         compliance with International FinancialReporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
        issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). 
        The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity 
        with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and 
        assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the 
        reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual 
        results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying 
        assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to accounting 
        estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimates are revised 
        and in any future periods affected. Estimates that are particularly 
        judgmental relate to the determination of the allowance for losses relating
        to finance receivables and loans and to the guarantee of managed receivables
         (notes 3(e) and 4), the determination of the value of goodwill on acquisition
         and annual impairment testing (note 7) and the value of intangible assets
         (note 9), as well as the net realizable value of deferred tax assets and 
        liabilities. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and 
         appropriate. The audited consolidated financial statements of the 
        Company have been prepared on an historical cost basis except for the 
        following items which are recorded at fair value:
         • Cash
          • Derivative financial instruments (a componentof other assets and/or 
          accounts payable and other liabilities)
          • Senior executive long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”)*; and
          • Guarantee of managed receivables*
          * a component of accounts payable and other liabilities
36                                                                                                                                                                                                    Accord Financial Corp.
        These audited consolidated financial statements          right-to-use assets, which are included in property 
        were approved for issue by the Company’s Board of         and equipment, are depreciated to the end of their 
        Directors (“Board”) on March 6, 2020.         useful life using the straight-line method over the 
        lease term as this most closely reflects the expected

        benefits. The lease term includes periods covered

        Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a          asset is adjusted for impairment, if any, and adjusted

        Company’s office leases where payments under such
        leases were previously expensed as part of operating         A lease liability is initially measured at the present 
        expenses. On January 1, 2019, the Company assessed         value of the lease payments that are not paid at the

        exemptions available under IFRS 16 for lease terms          amortized cost using the effective interest method 
        which end within twelve months of January 1, 2019,         whereby payments under the lease include both a

        accordingly, has not recognized right-of-use assets          arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is 
        and lease liabilities in respect of these leases. Upon          a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount
