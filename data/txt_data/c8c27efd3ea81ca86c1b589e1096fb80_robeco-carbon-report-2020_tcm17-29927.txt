Robeco carbon report 2020
 
Description of methodology and definitions
Introduction
Robeco’s Sustainability Report 2020 discloses the carbon impact of our investments. With carbon 
impact, we refer to GHG emissions from our investments measured by metric tons CO2 equivalents. 
While our client reporting has included carbon impact for a number of years already, this is the first 
time that we publicly disclose our financed emissions, in line with our commitment to the Dutch 
Climate Accord. This supporting document describes the methodology and definitions that are used 
for producing the carbon impact figures.
Scope
The scope of our carbon report are all Robeco funds, but not including segregated client mandates. 
The report covers listed corporate equity and corporate bonds. Government bonds are not in scope 
as their footprint methodology is not yet well-established for financial accounting purposes. Green 
bonds are also not included in the aggregate footprint calculation, because current accounting 
methods capture the footprint of the issuer rather than the bond. We report scope 1 and 2 only, 
since scope 3 is prone to too many data challenges at this stage.
Carbon metrics 
We calculate three different carbon metrics that cover the PCAF method (“carbon footprint”), 
the TCFD method (“carbon intensity”) as well as the total carbon emissions attributable to our 
investments. 
Total carbon emissions 
Where: 
–  T otal emissions in tCOeq  are the total GHG emissions in tons of CO equivalent (tCOeq) 
2 2 2
attributed to Robeco 
–  I is an indicator function which is 1 if asset i is in scope and has footprint data and 0 otherwise
i
–  Emissions are the total scope 1+2 GHG emissions of the company i in tCOeq  
i 2
–   Investment in asset is the total value of the investment in the company i in equity and fixed 
i
income 
–  EV is the enterprise value (EV) of the company i 
i
Carbon footprint 
Where: 
–  Carbon footprint is tCOeq per one million USD invested 
2
–  w   is the weight of the investment of company i in equity and fixed income in the total AUM in 
i
million USD, calculated as
–   Other parameters are defined as above

Carbon intensity
The weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) is calculated as 
Where: 
–  Carbon intensity is tCOeq per one million USD revenues
2
–  Other parameters are defined as above
Data sources 
The carbon emissions data per 2018 fiscal year-end is sourced from Robeco Switzerland Ltd. 
Reported values from companies are captured from the following third parties: 
–  The S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment 2020
–  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
–  Company reports (annual and sustainability reports) 
Robeco Switzerland Ltd. sources EV and revenue data from third party data provider Worldscope.  
All information about account data comes from PUMA. The assets under management numbers  
we use for calculating the footprint data are extracted from Robeco’s internal holdings database.
Data quality and coverage
When reported carbon values are unavailable or inconsistent, estimated carbon values are used. 
The estimations are based on regressions of scope 1+2 emissions as a function of revenues, done 
per peer group. Of the 11’692 companies covered in the total universe, around 22% are based on 
reported numbers, with the remaining 78% estimated. About 8% of the company provided data had 
to be rejected and corrected (7%) or estimated (1%) due to inconsistencies or obvious errors (e.g. 
wrong units).
Given all out-of-scope exclusions, we can calculate the coverage on which the reported footprint 
measures are based. Aggregation of all funds that are in-scope gives us the In-scope AUM. This is 
the base on which the coverage is calculated.
Where:
–  C overage is the share of total AUM in % for which we have carbon data available (company 
provided data or estimated data)
–  I( in    s c o  p e  ) is an indicator which is 1 if asset i is in-scope and 0 otherwise
i
–  I (Carbon data ) is an indicator function which is 1 if the issuer of asset i has carbon data and 0 
i                           
otherwise
