LETTER FROM THE CEO
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Dear reader,
The financial year 2018 was an exceptional year for NIBC in many aspects. Having experienced our
own decisive moment with the listing of NIBC on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the 23rd of
March, we remain focused on our clients’ decisive moments, driven by our core values of being
Professional, Entrepreneurial and Inventive. We continue to rebalance our portfolios and to build
curves for the future. Propelled by realised equity exits and higher interest income, we outperformed
our medium-term objectives:
■ Return on equity (ROE) for the full year 2018 was 13.2%, including the one-off results on the sale
of certain equity positions. Excluding these and some other non-recurring items, we consider a
ROE of 10.4% to be a better reflection of the real performance.
■ Our cost/income ratio of 41% is well below the 45% mark, allowing us the flexibility to invest in
the development of our business and do all what is necessary from regulatory compliance to
investments in IT.
■ Our strong capital position, as represented by our CET1 ratio, increased from 18.4% per 1 January
2018 to 20.6% at the end of 2018.
■ Underpinning the strong performance and in line with our dividend policy, we propose a final
dividend of EUR 2.47 per share, totaling a full dividend for 2018 of EUR 3.65 per share or
EUR 229 million.
■ Confirming NIBC's strong performance, S&P assigned a positive outlook to our “BBB“ credit rating
last October.
All in all, 2018 was a very successful year for NIBC with, for the second consecutive year, a net profit
in excess of EUR 200 million.
The share price of NIBC Holding outperformed the market as it closed relatively close to the IPO
issue price, as opposed to the average of European banks, for which last year has been an ‘annus
horribilis’ with average price-to-book values falling from over 1.0x to below 0.8x, or a 30% decrease.
For ourselves, we realise that past performance is no guarantee for future success. Therefore, looking
forward, we will be more than ever cautious as the economic climate seems to be close to its cycle
peak, geopolitical tensions persist to have an effect on market volatility, regulatory oversight has
further intensified, and the business is facing increasing challenges to rebalance and grow our book.
Although we have a clear strategy and have defined our position in the financial ecosystem as
propagated at the Capital Markets Update last November in London, we have also reflected on
challenges arising on the horizon. Can we sustain our efficient model with the scale we have, can we
absorb higher future funding cost, can we incorporate the ever-increasing regulatory oversight, not
only as to cost, but also as to a claim on internal capacity and business model options, or how well
are we positioned for a potential downturn?
So, where are we today?
At the core of our strategy is our ability to rebalance and reinvent our business. Within the chosen
sectors, we may vary subsector, product or the combination, so that we can support clients with
value added services. On a continuous basis, we prudently rebalance portfolios, not only to grow in
areas where we see opportunities, but also to deliberately reduce where we need to manage
exposures within our risk appetite.
As a professional and fully regulated bank, we are uniquely positioned in the market between on the
one hand the large and very large players and the smaller and more innovative fintechs on the other
hand. Being in between, we can partner with both sides. We have the professionalism and the agility
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 13
LETTER FROM THE CEO
to work together to streamline the bank through partnerships, where scale is required or innovation
is needed.
We embrace the fintech domain to learn from them and to work together with them in
partnerships. Mostly, the relationship with a fintech starts by a financing relationship for their
receivable portfolios and as such, we import their growth to our balance sheet. Next to OakNorth
and Ebury, also names like iwoca, an award-winning UK fintech in the SME financing space, RatePAY,
or Finleap in Berlin. In these receivable finance portfolios, we have seen fast growth over the last year
and we have the ambition to bring it to a EUR 1.5 billion portfolio.
In some sectors, where the curve is possibly at or close to its tipping point, we see more downward
challenges than upward potential. This relates to our highly cyclical businesses, Shipping and Offshore
Energy, the latter of which we reduced our exposure from EUR 1.3 billion to currently below
EUR 1.0 billion. We will further reduce the combined exposure of those two cyclical sectors by
approximately EUR 150 million annually. But at the same time, we will remain open for business, as
we follow our clients to adapt to their new role in a sustainable energy transition. Last but not least,
we feel the leverage finance market is overheated, evidenced by low returns, high leverage and loose
covenant structures. Nevertheless, also here, we remain open for business but we are quite
restrictive in taking new deals in. With the high churn of our portfolio, driven by the oversupply of
liquidity, we have brought back this portfolio by EUR 200 million in 2018 and we will reduce it further
to approximately EUR 1.0 billion in the coming years.
At the same time, origination and refinancings for our corporate client offering increased to a record
level of EUR 3.7 billion although elevated (p)repayments kept total volume more or less stable, and as
such we were able to compensate the deliberate rebalancing started in 2018.
Retail also experienced record origination levels with a production of EUR 3.4 billion new mortgage
loans. Not only on our own balance sheet, but especially with our strategic partner AXA Investment
Managers, where we are well positioned to benefit from the ever-increasing demand from consumers
for longer fixed-term interest rates. We have seen double-digit growth in our originate-to-manage
business and our ambition for 2019 is to surpass the EUR 5 billion mark in mandates.
We place margin over volume and do not necessarily strive for market share. Especially in today’s
markets of low-for-long interest rates, abundance of liquidity and subsequent high levels of pre- and
repayments, we focus on quality above quantity. This remains a delicate balance to be managed as in
both businesses, margins remain under pressure, affecting overall revenues going forward. This can be
even more challenging as interest rate hike expectations have been pushed forward while funding
markets have tightened, economic growth is levelling off, credit quality is less benign, and geopolitical
risks ranging from trade wars to Brexit continue to define volatility.
The permanent and increased focus on know your customer and Anti-Money Laundering has, on the
corporate client side of the business, resulted in a project aimed at further strengthening our
processes. Alongside, the retail client side is also in the process of enhancing its systematic integrity
risk assessment related policies and procedures.
Our DNA starts with our ‘Think Yes’ mentality, built around our three core values. That is how we
do the business. That is also what we get back from our clients and the high appreciation for our
services that has always been translated in a high NPS score as well as a high client satisfaction score.
We are well connected to our franchise and we will further rebalance our portfolios as we will
continue to grow in our chosen segments.

LETTER FROM THE CEO
Concluding, on behalf of my team, I am proud that we are delivering on our promises. Despite
uncertainty and challenges in the markets around us, I remain confident about our future,
strengthened by our distinct business model and our clearly defined role in the financial ecosystem. I
am therefore grateful to our employees, for the perseverance and commitment they have shown, as
they are the driving force behind our ability to support our clients at their decisive moments, so that
we can continue to build profitable growth into the future. And last but not least, I am thankful for
the support from our investors since our IPO, and for the ongoing trust from our clients to fulfil their
needs.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
REPORT OF THE MANAGING
BOARD
The following chapters, Corporate Governance, Risk Management and In Control Report are also
considered part of the Report of the Managing Board, as mentioned in Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code.
GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economic fundamentals in 2018 have further improved in north-western Europe. GDP growth
in the Netherlands continues to be at the high-end of post-crisis growth numbers. Associated with
this, unemployment has been decreasing and housing prices have further increased. However, we
observe various risks arising in the world around us. In the third quarter of 2018 Germany reported
a decrease in economic activity leading to several profit warnings in the market. On a global level we
observe several indications that the economic conditions are becoming more challenging. Geopolitical
tensions and the risk of a full-fledged trade war persist to have an affect on the volatility of financial
markets. Additionally the ambiguous form of the Brexit contributes to uncertainty in our markets.
We are aware of the current economic situation and are anticipating on developments in the markets
we operate in. Being a medium-sized bank with a strategic focus on niche markets enables us to
reflect on the current circumstances and to make clear choices regarding the deployment of available
resources. NIBC is not a market share player and this gives us the ability to consolidate or reduce our
exposures in certain markets, and to expand into others.
In 2018 interest rates continued to be at historically low levels, resulting in a liquidity abundance in
capital markets, also impacting the lending market where we encounter pressure on prices. On the
other hand, the abundance of liquidity also reduces the spread we pay on our funding products. In
the retail market we see increased demand for long-term fixed rate mortgage loans, which typically is
incompatible with the funding pattern of banks. We have anticipated this shift in consumer preference
and are now able to benefit through our originate-to-manage offering. In this product we originate
long-term fixed rate mortgage loans under the NIBC Direct brand for institutional investors who
seek these long-duration products. Over the course of 2018 credit spreads have widened due to the
aforementioned uncertainties in the global economic and political environments. We remain cautious
in this uncertain and volatile environment and seek to grow in sectors and products where we see
opportunities with attractive risk/reward characteristics. Currently these attractive opportunities
typically are to be found in sectors and products with smaller individual exposures and increased
diversification opportunities such receivables financing in our Structuring portfolio.
In the financial services industry we see fintechs increasingly becoming active, but also big technology
companies finding their way to the financial services sector. Fintech start-ups are bringing innovative
solutions to specific financial service products and often seek cooperation with incumbent financial
institutions because they lack the scale and regulatory expertise to independently challenge the
financial services industry. NIBC recognises the impact fintechs have on the banking industry and we
are seeking cooperation with selected companies as evidenced by our collaboration with OakNorth
and equity participations in Ebury and Finleap.
On the regulatory side, we see continuously increasing pressure in the area of non-financial risk
management. Several topics related to client due diligence, data privacy and transaction reporting
demand attention from management and stakeholders, in order to comply with the continuously
changing regulatory environment.

VISION AND STRATEGY
About NIBC
NIBC was established in 1945 to finance the visionary entrepreneurs who helped rebuild the
Netherlands after World War II. Over time, we evolved to being an enterprising bank offering
financing, advisory, and co-investing to our clients. After we came out of the 2008 financial crisis, we
have reinvented ourselves. We have seen many milestones since, with the launch of NIBC Direct, the
acquisitions of Gallinat Bank AG in Germany and SNS Securities, now NIBC Bank Deutschland AG
and NIBC Markets respectively. More recently our steps into the fintech space by acquiring minority
stakes in Ebury and Finleap and the announced cooperation with OakNorth have been major
milestones. We have continued to build on our entrepreneurial DNA and have become the bank
that we are today; best suited to help our clients at their decisive moments. Now and in the future.
We aim to create a sustainable franchise for the future, so we can continue to fulfill our purpose.
Purpose and corporate values
Our purpose is to create a sustainable franchise for the future, so we can continue to make a
difference for our clients by focusing on their most decisive moments in business and in life.
As a bank built for entrepreneurs, we are committed to cultivate our ‘Think YES’ mentality by being
flexible and agile and by matching our clients’ can-do attitude. Our everyday decisions and actions are
guided by three corporate values, with which we aim to differentiate ourselves in the market:
1. Professional: Our in-depth sector knowledge, expert financial solutions and tailored risk and
portfolio management are the foundation of our success.
2. Entrepreneurial: We are a sound and enterprising bank focused on decisive moments in our
clients’ business and in life. Our clients require a bank that can respond to their needs in an agile
way.
3. Inventive: We provide bespoke solutions and encourage our people to think creatively to meet
clients’ financial needs. Structuring is part of our DNA.
Strategic priorities
We have identified six strategic priorities that describe our identity and the way we operate.

NIBC is a medium-sized bank active in north-western Europe, more specifically in the Netherlands,
Germany, the UK, Belgium and the Nordics. We know these markets and we believe in the economic
foundations of this particular geographical area. Next to the clear geographic focus, we differentiate
ourselves by our margin over volume strategy, which implies we are not driving our business on
market share, emphasising quality over quantity. This enables us to continuously rebalance the
portfolio and reduce exposures to (sub)sectors with increased risks and to expand in other sectors
with a better risk-reward outlook.
NIBC's corporate clients are often private or family-owned companies with annual revenues between
EUR 50 million and EUR 500 million, active in sectors where we have extensive experience and
expertise. Our client offering consists of the full range of products such as advisory, financial
structuring, collateralised lending, corporate lending, mezzanine and equity. In the retail client offering
we operate without a branche network. Mortgage loans are offered via intermediaries where also
mortgage products targeting clients in underserved market segments such as buy-to-let and
mortgages for the self-employed are offered. The originate-to-manage proposition is a relatively new
pillar in the retail franchise in which we currently are successful. Next to this, we offer online savings
products directly to customers.
18 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In doing business we differentiate ourselves through our 'Think YES' mentality where we think with
and for our clients. This strategy is appreciated by our clients, as evidenced in high client satisfaction
and NPS scores. The focus on decisive moments means we do not offer any payment and current
account services, which translates into the objective of a sustainable cost/income ratio below 45%.
We continuously manage the composition of our funding by making use of a diverse range of funding
sources, from retail savings to covered bonds and subordinated funding. One of our strengths has
always been a strong capital position, providing flexibility for supporting further growth either
organically or inorganically, or to support shareholder returns. All the above is managed by an
experienced team that has the professional, entrepreneurial and inventive mindset that distinguishes
NIBC in the financial ecosystem.
Our place in the financial ecosystem
NIBC is well positioned in the financial ecosystem. As a fully regulated bank we have the professional
mindset making us well positioned to partner with large financial institutions, while also having the
agility to cooperate with small and innovative fintechs. By exploring opportunities in both directions,
we continuously work on further positioning the bank.
This is evidenced by our originate-to-manage mortgage product where we have a strategic
partnership with AXA Investment Managers. Further, the mortgage business back office is
outsourced to Stater, and independent mortgage brokers are used in the origination of mortgage
loans. On the other hand we are partnering with fintechs to optimize our credit review process (e.g.
OakNorth) and to identify new corporate client prospects (e.g. Ebury). Partnering with fintechs also
entails financing their receivables, which is one of our growth drivers for the future.
Medium-term objectives
The deployment of our strategy should enable NIBC to deliver on the targets we set early 2018:
IFRS 9
Medium- ex. non-
term IFRS 9 recurring 2017
objectives 2018 2018 2017 ex. Vijlma

Rating Bank BBB+ BBB BBB BBB BBB
Annualised dividend pay-out ratio >50% 100% 45%
In 2018, we delivered on the medium-term objectives. During 2018, S&P has adjusted NIBC's credit
rating outlook to positive, and we view a rating upgrade to BBB+ as a realistic scenario, when NIBC
fills in the MREL and ALAC requirements (please see the 'Minimum requirement for own funds and
eligible liabilities (MREL)' section for more details). When looking at our 2018 results excluding non-
recurring items, we believe that the goals stated above display a healthy level of ambition in the
current economic environment.
The items identified as non-recurring in 2018 are EUR 37 million of income related to the sale of
fund investments, EUR 6 million of operating expenses related to NIBC's IPO and the
remeasurement of the deferred tax asset following the improved results (EUR 17 million). These are
explained in more detail in the 'Significant events impacting our financial statements' section in the
Financial review.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 19
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The way forward
Our strategy is aimed at having the agility to continuously rebalance our portfolio: grow where
markets indicate healthy risk-reward developments and active position management where markets
are experiencing pressure, so that we can support our clients throughout the cycle. Improving our
risk profile is one of the intended effects of the rebalancing strategy, to be accomplished through
increasing the granularity within our portfolio and reducing large single client exposures. For the year
2019 and the years thereafter our commitment to deliver on the medium-term objectives as stated
in the previous paragraph is our highest priority.
Delivery on our medium-term objectives is to be achieved, amongst others, through further
expansion of our partnerships with fintechs. Besides learning from their technical skills, financing their
accounts receivables portfolio fits our rebalancing strategy because it adds granularity to our
portfolio. We aim to further increase our receivables finance portfolio to EUR 1.5 billion over the
next two years. Furthermore, growing the portfolio of Beequip, the leasing venture of NIBC Holding
which is financed by NIBC Bank, is another deliverable for 2019. Our ambition is to double the
current portfolio of about EUR 400 million over the next two years.
In our retail client offering we aim to further increase our originate-to-manage portfolio which has
displayed continued strong growth in 2018 to EUR 2.4 billion, an increase of EUR 1.7 billion. In 2019,
we aim to increase the current mandate of EUR 3.5 billion to EUR 5 billion.
Next to growing these businesses, our goal is to reduce our exposure in cyclical sectors. We see
more downward pressure than upside potential in our portfolios subject to cyclical influences. The
Offshore Energy portfolio has already been reduced, and the combined USD exposures of Offshore
Energy and Shipping & Intermodal will be decreased in the coming years. In the leveraged finance
market we see increasing levels of leverage, loose covenants and decreasing returns. Because of these
developments, many transaction proposals do not fit NIBC's risk appetite and are therefore not
pursued. As NIBC aims to reduce this portfolio in the coming years, it has the opportunity to be
strict on new transaction proposals.

As of 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 has been fully implemented. This has a significant effect on the
classification of a part of the mortgage portfolio which resulted in a decrease of retained earnings
(capital). As the adoption of IFRS 9 has an effect on various key figures, comparative figures as at
1 January 2018 with the IFRS 9 transition effects are included, where relevant. The impact of IFRS 9 is
explained in the section 'Significant events impacting our financial statements'.
In 2018, a substantial part of the equity investment portfolio has been sold, resulting in a positive
impact on investment income and a significant reduction of related risk-weighted assets (RWA),
positively impacting NIBC's CET 1 ratio. Furthermore, operating expenses include EUR 6 million one-
off costs relating to the IPO. Finally, the deferred tax asset has been reviewed and adjusted. Based on
the positive development of NIBC's profit level, the deferred tax asset has increased by
EUR 17 million as NIBC expects to fully compensate losses from 2010 and 2011. Given the material
impact of these items, the 2018 results are presented both including and excluding these non-
recurring results.
In 2017, EUR 47 million of NIBC's profit after tax related to the sale of the German commercial real
estate legacy portfolio of Vijlma. This portfolio was sold in 2017 and final settlement of the sold
assets took place in 2018. The presentation above is consistent with the Financial Performance
paragraph as presented in the 2017 Annual Report. For 2017, the term non-recurring refers to this
result of Vijlma.

On the back of increased net interest income, profitability further improved in 2018. Similar to 2017,
investment income is at an elevated level. In 2018 this is the result of several successful exits in our
equity investment portfolio. Both profit after tax and return on equity display substantial growth.
Profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of the company increased to EUR 229 million.
Excluding non-recurring results, this amounts to EUR 181 million (+11%). Return on equity increased
to 13.2% (+22%) or 10.4% (+24%) without non-recurring results. The return on equity ratios are
impacted by the transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018, which resulted in a significantly lower equity
base at the start of 2018.

We are a medium-sized bank focusing on niche markets where we can add value with our
differentiated approach. Due to our size we have the agility to enter sectors and products where we
spot opportunities and to remain cautious in those where we see increasing levels of risk. 2018 has
been about reducing the risks in our portfolio through a strategy of focusing on diversifiable
portfolios with smaller tickets while remaining cautious in our exposures to cyclical (sub)sectors.
During 2018 we continued to improve our funding profile. We issued two 10-year Conditional Pass-
Through Covered Bonds, returned to the RMBS market and issued a public 5-year GBP transaction,
in addition to a new 5-year benchmark EUR senior unsecured transaction. As a result of these
transactions we were able to lengthen our average maturity and to further reduce the funding
spread, which is reflected in a higher net interest margin. Next to the increased interest margin, we
showed strong liquidity and solvency ratios, and we are well-capitalised with a CET 1 of 20.6%,
comfortably above SREP-requirements. This strong capitalisation implies we are well positioned to
absorb the potential capital impact of Basel IV, to pay-out dividends in line with our dividend policy
and we are ideally positioned for (non-)organic growth.
Significant events impacting our financial statements
Over the past year there have been a number of events that had a significant impact on the financial
performance in 2018.
Transition to IFRS 9
At 1 January 2018 NIBC implemented the new accounting standard IFRS 9, Financial Instruments
which replaced IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The application of IFRS 9
has various effects on our financial statements.
IFRS 9 has an effect on the classification of financial assets and on the calculation of credit losses. The
total implementation impact of IFRS 9 on shareholders' equity is a reduction of EUR 256 million. The
main effects can be summarised as follows:
■ With the application of IFRS 9, the FVtPL mortgage loan portfolio has been reclassified to
amortised cost. The mortgages previously held at FVtPL had an unrealised fair value gain of
EUR 321 million. Upon transition to amortised cost, this resulted in a reversal of the unrealised fair
value of EUR 321 million before tax;
■ The FVtPL mortgages were hedged with derivatives, which had a negative fair value at the date
of transition, offsetting a large part of the unrealised fair value of the mortgage portfolio. The
derivative classification is unchanged, and therefore, this derivative portfolio will, until maturity,
generate a gain to offset the negative revaluation per transition date;
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 23
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
■ As part of the revision of NIBC’s hedging framework, the existing hedging portfolio (with
relatively high interest rates) has been unwound and replaced with new swaps at current (low)
interest rates. As a result, the gain until maturity is recognised in net interest income, due to the
lower coupon that NIBC pays on the hedging derivatives. For 2018, the estimated effect of this
gain in net interest income amounts to approximately EUR 50 million;
■ The remeasurement of exposures based on expected credit losses (ECL) resulted in a negative
effect on retained earnings of EUR 22 million, effectively increasing the impairment provision.
■ Reclassification of corporate loans resulted in EUR 5 million reversal of a positive revaluation
reserve from other reserves;
From an operational perspective, the implementation of IFRS 9 has had a significant impact as well.
The transition meant the implementation of new models to calculate expected credit losses, and the
adjustment of many processes and systems. Following the first year of reporting based on the new
standard, NIBC will continue to enhance its processes, focused on increasing the effectiveness and
efficiency of its internal controls.
Initial public offering (IPO) of NIBC Holding
As of 23 March 2018 NIBC Holding is officially a publicly listed company on the Amsterdam stock
exchange. Significant non-recurring expenses for advisors, personnel expenses and costs of the listing
itself are directly related to the IPO. In 2018 these expenses amounted to a total of EUR 6 million
before tax.
Sale of fund investments
NIBC European Infrastructure Fund (NEIF), a fund managed by NIBC Bank and in which NIBC also
has an investment, sold two large portfolios. The transactions fit in our strategic review of fund
investments as announced in the prospectus for the IPO of NIBC Holding. As the fund manager we
were able to successfully execute the fund strategy and sell large parts of the NEIF portfolio.
In the second half of 2018, agreements were reached on the sale of two large investments in the
fund. Both transactions have been settled before the end of 2018, leading to a total operating income
from NEIF of approximately EUR 35 million.
In addition, the manager of NIBC Merchant Banking Fund 1B sold two large positions in 2018. Both
CycloMedia and SportCity have been successfully closed and settled, leading to a realised result of
EUR 16 million.
With the sale of these large equity investments and the strategy to build and manage a more granular
investment portfolio, the larger part of these results are deemed to be non-recurring. In line with the
non-recurring characteristics of these results, NIBC has paid a second interim dividend of
EUR 37 million in December 2018, in addition to adhering to the standing dividend policy.
Financial Performance
The following sections describe the financial developments and analyses the performance of NIBC in
2018.
Operating income
Excluding the non-recurring income, operating income increased to EUR 513 (+9%). Including the
non-recurring items listed above, total operating income further increased in 2018 from
EUR 512 million to EUR 550 million, an increase of 7%.
24 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Net interest income
In 2018, net interest income further improved, as it was supported by a further reduction of the
effective funding spread from 0.87% to 0.73%. Another determinant of the growth in net interest
income was the IFRS 9 related pull-to-par effect of approximately EUR 50 million. Based on these
bank
developments, the net interest margin increased to 2.10%. Excluding the IFRS 9 effect on net interest
income, the net interest margin increased to 1.85%. In total, net interest income increased from
EUR 349 million in 2017 to EUR 432 million in 2018.

On the corporate client side, the lending margin decreased by 2 basis points to 2.77%, and the
volume of interest generating corporate client assets remained stable at EUR 9.7 billion. At the same
time the funding spread decreased in 2018, contributing to a higher corporate lending margin. In total
this resulted in a EUR 15 million increase of net interest income to EUR 202 million.

Portfolio spread Origination spread
In our retail client offering the net volume of mortgage loans (including netting of savings values and
exclusion of fair value amounts) increased by EUR 450 million to a total of EUR 9.3 billion. The
margin on own book mortgages decreased from 2.53% to 2.36%, reflecting a decrease in the margin
on newly originated mortgage loans. In the current low interest rate environment we observed
increasing competition in the Dutch mortgage market. This results in a substantial lower level of
origination spreads for the mortgage loans originated in 2018, compared to the years before. This
also has a decreasing effect on the spread of the total mortgage loan portfolio. The fact that we are
originating shorter tenor mortgages for our own book further contributed to the reduction of the
spread on the mortgage loan book. Furthermore we have adjusted our appetite to originate more
holding
loan-to-value mortgages at the lower end of the spectrum. This also contributes to a lower spread as
well as a better collateralised mortgage loan portfolio. Interest income for our retail client offering
grew from EUR 127 million in 2017 to EUR 130 million in 2018.

In 2018 we made a deliberate decision to benefit from the low interest environment. Issuing our
wholesale funding more on the long end of the curve. As a result we further improved and
diversified our funding with the issuance of two 10-year Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bonds, a
benchmark EUR senior unsecured transaction, a public GBP senior unsecured transaction, a new
RMBS transaction and an increase in the mix of on-demand deposits as a share of total customer
deposits. We also received an upgrade of our credit rating outlook by S&P, resulting in a BBB rating
with a positive outlook (2017: BBB, stable outlook). S&P's credit rating outlook for NIBC changed
from stable to positive based on the expectation that NIBC will issue sufficient additional loss-
absorption capacity (ALAC, the S&P equivalent of MREL).
In 2018 funding expenses continued to improve. Credit spreads have decreased over the past years
but have increased during 2018. Market data shows a significant increase in spreads on unsecured
funding for financial institutions. The spread widening is also displayed in the two covered bond
transactions during 2018. Whereas in January we issued a covered bond with a spread of 13 basis
points over 3-months EURIBOR, the spread on the issuance in September amounted to 21 basis
points. Consequently, we expect that the low end of the funding curve has been reached.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Net fee and commission income
Originate-to-manage fees display strong growth in line with the continued growth of the assets under
management. Additionally, investment management fees remained strong, fuelled by strong
performance of equity investments, including those exited in 2018.
■ Fee income from the originate-to-manage mortgage offering increased from EUR 4 million in 2017
to EUR 11 million in 2018. During 2018, NIBC further increased the mandate with its institutional
partner AXA Investment Managers to a level of EUR 3.5 billion. Under this mandate, a portfolio of
EUR 2.4 billion has been originated. As NIBC is well positioned to cooperate with large financial
institutions, we continue to seek further growth of the originate-to-manage proposition as this is a
scalable business which helps to further diversify income with a limited capital impact.
■ Investment management fees remain strong due to the successful exits of several equity positions,
resulting in higher management and performance fees. Since we are shifting the investment
portfolio away from investments in funds, and towards more smaller direct investments, we expect
investment management fees to decrease going forward.
■ M&A related fees remained stable at EUR 11 million, with both 2017 and 2018 including a single
deal with significant fee income. In 2018, EUR 7 million related to the purchase of HSH Nordbank
by a consortium led by J.C. Flowers Funds, where NIBC acted as the M&A advisor for the buyer.
■ In 2018 lending related fee income has decreased. Rebalancing the portfolio results in origination
that is focused on well-collateralised transactions requiring less upfront (structuring) services and
therefore lower lending related fees.
■ Fee income related to NIBC Markets was disappointing. Partly, this relates to the discontinuation
of several fee-generating activities as part of our reorientation of Markets' activities, and it also
reflect difficult market circumstances as well as impact from new regulation such as MiFID II.

Investment income
In 2018 investment income remained at an elevated level. An important part (EUR 51 million) of the
EUR 74 million of investment income in 2018 reflects realised income from a number of successful
exits in our equity investment portfolio, whereas the EUR 67 million in 2017 mainly reflected non-
cash revaluations on the portfolio.
Due to the exits, the on-balance equity investment portfolio decreased significantly from
EUR 333 million in 2017 to EUR 199 million at the end of 2018.
Our strategy and ability to rebalance our portfolios also entails that within the investment portfolio
there is a shift away from relatively large investments in funds towards more granular direct equity

Operating expenses
Total operating expenses are impacted by the continued investments we are making in our
organisation and various projects. These projects relate to the (re)transition of our IT infrastructure,
regulatory requirements, IFRS 9, MIFID II, AnaCredit and increased requirements relating to Know
Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML).
Personnel expenses
In 2018 the number of FTEs decreased, primarily caused by the discontinuation of activities in NIBC
Markets. This is reflected in the EUR 4 million decrease in total personnel expenses to
EUR 105 million in 2018. Excluding IPO expenses, personnel expenses amounted to EUR 99 million
in 2018 (2017 excluding IPO: EUR 105 million).

Other operating expenses
In 2018 we continued to invest in our IT landscape. We started the year 2018 to retransition our IT
infrastructure back from our former outsourcing partner to NIBC premises. This resulted in
additional costs. Parallel to the retransition, we started to negotiate with a new partner to outsource
the IT infrastructure. In July, the transfer of the IT infrastructure to this party has started. Until

medium-term objective of a cost/income ratio below 45%. It has to be noted, however, that the
elevated level of investment income in 2018 had a significant impact on the cost/income ratio. The
cost/income ratio excluding non-recurring income and expenses equals 43%.

Credit loss expense / (recovery)
With the application of IFRS 9 in 2018, the credit loss expenses have a different composition than
prior periods. Including the impact of stage 1 and stage 2 assets, total credit loss expenses amount to
EUR 54 million, compared to IAS 39-based credit loss expenses of EUR 55 million in 2017. Stage 3
credit loss expenses related to the corporate client offering amount to EUR 62 million, whereas a
credit loss recovery amounting to EUR 8 million was recognised in the retail client offering. Other
credit losses amounting to EUR 5 million, relate to assets classified at Fair Value and the sale of
individual exposures. The level of the impairments are elevated, reflecting the challenges we see in
certain sectors and products. Especially the Offshore Energy and Shipping & Intermodal sectors and
Leveraged Finance product portfolio.
The cost of risk is above our medium-term ambition level. While elevated impairments on individual
Leveraged Finance and Offshore Energy exposures partially explain the level of credit losses, the
reduction of RWAs also contributed to the increase in cost of risk. The sale of a part of our equity
investments reduced RWAs by EUR 458 million. Total RWAs at year-end amount to EUR 7.7 billion,
compared to EUR 8.5 billion in 2017.
In the following graph other credit losses refer to credit losses on assets recognised at FVtPL.

Tax
Tax expense in 2018 amounts to EUR 31 million, implying an effective tax rate of 11%. This is well
below the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. This mainly relates to the elevated level of investment
income which is tax exempt under Dutch tax law and the recognition of an additional deferred tax
asset.
In 2018, NIBC has recognised a positive revaluation of the Dutch deferred tax asset (DTA). This
revaluation is based on the forecasted profitability of NIBC in future years, and clarity on the tax
treatment of the IFRS 9 transition effect. The DTA that reflects the tax loss carry forwards from
losses from 2010 and 2011 has been revalued at par at year-end 2018. This revaluation resulted in a
non-recurring gain in our tax expenses of EUR 17 million, also reducing the effective tax rate.
As of 2020 the corporate tax rate will be gradually decreased towards a level of 20.5% in 2021.
These steps will not impact the DTA, as they have already been included in the current valuation of
the DTA.
Profit attributable to non-controlling shareholders
Our AT1 instrument amounting to EUR 200 million with a 6% coupon and a 7 years non-call results
in an annual interest expense of EUR 12 million. Under IFRS, the AT1 instrument is classified as
equity. The interest paid on this AT1 instrument is accounted for as profit attributable to non-
controlling shareholders, but classified as interest expense for tax purposes. As of 2019 the interest
paid on the AT1 instrument is no longer eligible for tax deduction.
Profit after tax attributable to shareholders
NIBC’s profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of the company amounts to a total of
EUR 229 million, compared to EUR 210 million in 2017.
NIBC Bank N.V. currently has a EUR 233 million outstanding loan to the parent company (NIBC
Holding N.V.). As the parent company does not have sufficient cash generating activities on a stand
alone basis, this creates a double leverage from a NIBC Bank N.V. perspective. In order to resolve the
double leverage, NIBC Holding N.V. is required to repay the outstanding loan which is only possible if
it has a sufficient cash position resulting from dividend distributions. NIBC is committed to resolve the
double leverage in the next few years. As a first step, NIBC Bank N.V. proposes to distribute its full
2018 profit after tax attributable to shareholders to the parent company.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 31
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Dividend policy and pay-out
Dividend policy
As stated in our medium-term objectives, we envisage a dividend pay-out of at least 50% of net profit
attributable to shareholders. Part of the total dividend will be in the form of an interim dividend post
half-year figures. For the next two years we aim to pay-out an interim dividend of (at least)
EUR 37 million (under normal circumstances). Any dividends we intend to distribute are conditional
upon sufficient profitability and conformation with all regulatory requirements, as well as sufficient
capital and liquidity ratios as laid down in our policies.
Dividend pay-out 2018
The Managing Board proposes a total pay-out of EUR 3.65 per share for 2018. This translates to a
total distribution to shareholders of EUR 229 million, or a total dividend pay-out of 100%. During
2018 we distributed EUR 1.18 per share as interim dividends. Subsequent to the 2018 interim report
we distributed EUR 0.59, and the other EUR 0.59 per share was distributed as a second (special)
interim dividend in December where we distributed to our shareholders the gains from the sale of
several fund investments. We propose to pay out 100% of the profit for the year to NIBC Holding
N.V. The total dividend proposal compares to EUR 1.54 dividend per share in 2017.
Taking into account the above, the proposed final dividend distribution amounts to EUR 155 million,
reflecting EUR 2.47 per share. This proposed pay-out is subject to approval by the annual general
meeting of shareholders, scheduled on 26 April 2019.
The calculation of the maximum distributable amount, as set out in article 2.2.1 of the Regulation
'specific provisions CRDIV and CRR' of De Nederlandsche Bank N.V., containing requirements to the
maximum distributable amount and the calculation thereof, provides enough head room to pay-out
this dividend. The free distributable reserves on company level have also been taken into account and
allow for the proposed dividend distribution.

Assets
Total client assets increased to EUR 17.4 billion. The transition to IFRS 9 had a decreasing impact of
EUR 350 million on total client assets (refer to Accounting policies for details). During 2018 client
assets increased with EUR 460 million, mainly due to an increase in the mortgage loan portfolio.
In our corporate client offering we focused efforts on rebalancing the portfolio. We seek to originate
in sectors, subsectors and products in which we want to expand, such as lease lending and
receivables financing while reducing our exposures in Offshore Energy, Shipping & Intermodal and
Leveraged Finance. We reduced our Leveraged Finance exposure with more than EUR 200 million
from EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.3 billion. The growth in the other cyclical sectors was primarily caused
by foreign currency effects. The total volume of corporate loans origination in 2018 amounted to
EUR 3.6 billion, which compares to EUR 3.1 billion of origination in 2017. Including the increase in the
loans to Beequip, these movements resulted in a decrease in corporate client exposures from
EUR 10.0 billion to EUR 9.9 billion. In our origination efforts we remain focused on deploying a
margin over volume strategy, especially given our view that in some markets not all risks are priced
correctly. Especially in Leveraged Finance we continue to observe relatively low returns, high levels of
leverage and covenant-lite structures. Total drawn corporate client origination amounted to
EUR 2.2 billion, which was slightly less than re- and prepayments on our drawn portfolio. The
abundance of liquidity in the financial system is driving down returns, consequently making it
challenging to find interesting opportunities that fit our risk appetite. We have been noticing relatively
high levels of prepayment on our corporate loans. As a response to these challenges, we actively
steer the corporate client offering towards rebalancing and other growth sectors.
With regards to our retail client offering we continued building on our dual-track strategy of
originating shorter tenor mortgage loans for own book and origination of longer tenor mortgage
loans for the originate-to-manage proposition. In 2018, origination amounted to EUR 3.4 billion of
mortgage loans, of which EUR 1.8 billion related to the originate-to-manage business and the
remainder was originated for own book. Compared to 2017 mortgage origination volumes increased
by 83%, resulting in total mortgage loans under management of EUR 11.7 billion (1 January 2018:
EUR 9.6 billion, after the transition to IFRS 9).
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 33
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In 2017 the balance of FVtPL mortgage loans included EUR 321 million of positive fair value. With
the adoption of IFRS 9 and the classification and measurement of these mortgages at amortised cost,
the carrying value was adjusted to exclude the fair value. Taking into account this effect the underlying
value of the mortgage loans amounted to EUR 8.8 billion in 2017. The balance sheet value of the
mortgage portfolio increased to EUR 9.5 billion (excluding the netting of savings value) in 2018 due
to the origination of EUR 1.6 billion mortgage loans for own book, partially offset by re- and
prepayments. The exposure of buy-to-let mortgage loans remained stable at EUR 0.6 billion, primarily
due to increased competition in this market.
After a significant decrease in the derivative balances in 2017, the trend continued in 2018. Besides
closing offsetting derivative positions and an increase in derivatives included in netting arrangements,
the implementation of settle-to-market (STM) arrangements for centrally cleared derivatives has led
to further reductions of derivative balances. Under STM, the market value gain or loss of STM
derivatives is settled in cash on a daily basis. Therefore the balance of STM derivatives is close to nil at
year-end 2018.
Asset quality
In 2018 we managed to further reduce the expected loss on our performing portfolio. On our
corporate loan portfolio the expected loss decreased to 30 bps, down from 32 bps at year-end
2017. In the retail client offering the expected loss decreased by 4 bps to 9 bps at year-end 2018.
Our total impaired exposure increased from EUR 406 million at 1 January 2018 to EUR 446 million
at year-end 2018, mainly as a result of additional impaired exposures in Shipping & Intermodal and
Leveraged Finance. 31% of the total impaired exposures have been provisioned.
The implementation of IFRS 9 in 2018 has had a profound effect on the way we calculate credit loss
expenses. Prior to 2018 credit losses were based on an incurred loss model where impairments were
recognised if objective evidence of impairment due to a loss event could be reliably estimated. As of
1 January 2018 credit losses are recognised based on an expected credit loss model. Within this
model several stages are identified based on the credit quality of the asset:
■ Stage 1 assets are assets where no indication of a credit impairment is present. The majority of
our assets are categorised in this stage. A credit loss expense is recognised from initial recognition
of the asset, reflecting lifetime cash shortfalls if a default occurs within 12 months after the
reporting date, weighted by the probability of default of this specific asset;
■ Stage 2 ECL is calculated for assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)
subsequent to initial recognition. For these assets ECL is recognised reflecting lifetime cash
shortfalls that would result from all possible default events over the expected life of the asset,
again weighted by the risk of a default occurring;
■ Stage 3 instruments are recognised once a loss event has occurred. The ECL is then calculated by
estimating expected cash flows based on a chosen recovery strategy. It may be the case that an
asset is recognised as stage 3 without a credit allowance if the asset is expected to be fully
recoverable based on collateral;
■ POCI reflects purchased or originated credit impaired assets (POCI). POCI assets are recognised at
fair value and remain reported within this category until maturity.
The following table shows the ECL stage classification of our on-balance assets.

As mentioned before, the increase in stage 3 assets is mainly due to the continuing pressure on the
Offshore Energy, Shipping & Intermodal, and Leveraged Finance portfolios, where we saw additional
impaired assets in 2018.
Impact of IFRS 9 on asset quality ratios
Due to the transition towards IFRS 9 several asset quality ratios are impacted. As a result of the new
impairment calculation methodology the impairment coverage ratio increased upon adoption of IFRS
9 on 1 January 2018. Over the course of 2018, the ratios decreased as a consequence of newly
impaired assets and write offs. The ratio of top-20 exposures compared to CET 1 capital increased as
a result of the reduction of CET 1 capital, following the transition effects on retained earnings.

2018 1 Jan 2018 2017
Impaired coverage ratio 31% 51% 40%
Top-20 exposure / Common Equity Tier 1 70% 82% 62%
Funding and liquidity
We actively manage the composition of our funding profile and further enhanced the diversification
of our funding instruments, e.g. by the issuance of two 10-year Conditional Pass-Through Covered
Bonds. The return to the RMBS market and the GBP senior (preferred) market were important
milestones. With our presence in the UK and our GBP assets, we have a natural appetite for this
currency. We continued building the senior (preferred) curve with a 5-year benchmark transaction.
■ The volume of retail savings decreased by 4% to EUR 8.9 billion. The mix within retail funding
between on demand and term deposits has been managed towards more on demand savings. At
the end of 2018 61% of the retail savings consisted of on demand deposits, compared to 58% at
the end of 2017;
■ In the wholesale funding market we raised approximately EUR 2.8 billion in 2018 with notable
transactions displayed in the following graph;
■ In addition, EUR 282 million senior (preferred) funding was privately placed in different formats,
with various maturities and in various currencies;
■ Institutional deposits under the German ESF guarantee scheme increased by EUR 172 million to
EUR 1.5 billion.

Solvency
In 2018 the CET 1 ratio further improved compared to 1 January 2018, after transition to IFRS 9. It is
important to distinguish the effect related to the adoption of IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018, and the
increase in the solvency position during 2018.
Impact IFRS 9 on solvency position
For NIBC, the main impact of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 was related to the reclassification of the
mortgage loan portfolio at FVtPL to amortised cost, in line with the hold to collect business model
and with general market practice. This reclassification resulted in a one-off loss of EUR 321 million
36 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
before tax, relating to the revaluation amount on the mortgage loans, which was charged directly to
shareholders’ equity. The magnitude of this one-off loss at 1 January 2018 had a negative impact on
NIBC’s CET 1 ratio of 2.9%-points.
In addition to the reclassification of the FVtPL mortgage loan portfolio, the change from an incurred
loss to an expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model increased the level of loan provisions by
EUR 22 million. This led to a downward transition impact of 0.2%-points on 1 January 2018 on the
NIBC's CET 1 ratio.
Overall, the reduction of capital following the transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 led to a
reduction of NIBC's fully loaded solvency ratios, the total impact on CET 1 is 3.0%-points.
Solvency development in 2018
During 2018 the CET 1 ratio increased from 18.4% at 1 January 2018 to 20.6% at the end of 2018.
This increase reflects the decrease in our risk-weighted assets (RWA) mainly related to the reduction
of equity positions following the successful exits of several fund investments, partially compensated by
the new investment in HSH Nordbank. These effects reduced RWAs by EUR 458 million.
NbIaBnCk regularly refines and updates its advanced internal rating based (AIRB) models, significant
adjustments are subject to DNB approval. With our most recent submission we expect and
anticipate to have an increase in RWAs of approximately EUR 300 million.

SREP requirements
Our solvency levels are well above the minimum required levels as set by DNB in the SREP. The
maximum distributable amount is determined by comparing actual solvency levels to the minimum
SREP requirements. Solvency ratios have to exceed the SREP requirements to allow distribution of
dividends. Given the current situation, the maximum distributable amount calculation provides
sufficient room to execute NIBC's dividend policy.
As of 1 July 2018 a Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) of 0.1% is included in our SREP, due to
activities in the UK and the looming threat of Brexit.

Our unweighted solvency position calculated by the leverage ratio equals 7.9%, comfortably above
the minimum requirements.
Basel IV
The solvency ratios are comfortably above our SREP-levels and provide us with a sufficient buffer to
comply with the future Basel IV regulation. Although the regulation has not been finalised and full
implementation is only expected in 2027, we estimate the impact for NIBC to be an increase in our
RWAs in the range of 25% to 35% (2017: 20% - 30%). The increase is primarily related to the
reduction of our equity investments. This impact analysis does not include any management actions,
implying we have a similar portfolio upon implementation of the Basel III reforms as we currently
have.
An uncertainty for banks is that the new framework will have to be incorporated into legislation
within the European Union based on the European Commission proposal. This entire process is
expected to take several years. During this process of endorsement by the EU and subsequent
transfer to local law, certain adjustments to the regulation may be implemented. We aim to meet the
final requirements early in the phase-in period while we continue to execute our client-focused
strategy.
Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)
Under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), resolution authorities are required to
assess whether - in case of a bank's failure - the resolution objectives are best achieved by winding up
the bank under normal insolvency proceedings or resolving it. If it is the latter, a preferred resolution
strategy is developed, including the use of appropriate resolution tools and powers.
38 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
For NIBC, the relevant resolution authority – the Single Resolution Board (SRB) – has stated that bail-
in will form a part of the resolution strategy with a single point of entry at NIBC Bank level. In the
next resolution cycle NIBC Bank will receive a binding MREL target.
In line with the preferred resolution strategy the SRB has communicated an indicative – as yet non-
binding – MREL requirement to NIBC. The MREL requirement has been established to ensure that
banks in the European Union have sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities to absorb losses in the
case of a potential bank failure. This indicative non-binding MREL requirement is in line with our
expectations, and consistent with our funding and capital plans. Based on the initial discussions with
the resolution authorities, NIBC is confident it will meet the MREL requirement once it becomes
binding. The resolution authority has indicated that a binding MREL-target will be determined and
communicated in 2020. Future requirements will be subject to ongoing regulatory review and
clarification.
Based on the document ‘Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) – 2018
SRB Policy for the first wave of resolution plans’ (SRB policy document) disclosed by the SRB on
20 November 2018 an indicative ‘default’ MREL-requirement can be calculated for NIBC, by
combining the formula in that document with our SREP requirements as disclosed in the previous
table. Taking a forward looking approach we have based the calculations on beginning of year 2019
data and the 2018 SREP decisions displayed in the previous table.
The default formula is made up of two components:
■ A default loss-absorbing amount (LAA), which reflects the losses that the bank will incur in
resolution. The default LAA is the sum of a bank’s Pillar 1 requirement (P1), its Pillar 2
requirement (P2R), and its fully loaded combined buffer requirement (CBR).
In the case of NIBC this amounts to: 8% (P1) + 3.5% (P2R) + 2.6% (CBR) = 14.1% (LAA)
■ A default recapitalisation amount (RCA), which reflects the capital needed to meet ongoing
prudential requirements after resolution. The default RCA consists of the minimum requirement
for authorisation (P1 + P2R) and an amount intended to regain market confidence (MCC), of

In the case of NIBC this amounts to: 8% (P1) + 3.5% (P2R) + 2.6% (CBR) - 1.25% = 12.9% (RCA)
This leads to a default target MREL for NIBC of 27.0%. This target is displayed in the following graph

BUSINESS REVIEW
Corporate client offering
Our corporate client offering consists of providing our clients senior debt, mezzanine, equity, advisory
and capital markets products. With this product offering, we serve mid-market corporates in selected
sectors and subsectors in north-western Europe with the purpose to enable growth for our clients.
Clients are served from our offices in The Hague, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London. We distinguish
ourselves with tailor-made financing solutions and the ability to execute transactions swiftly at decisive
moments for our clients.
Senior Debt
In our senior debt product suite we offer asset based finance, corporate lending, receivables finance,
leveraged finance and leasing products, in the following sector – product combinations.
Sector Products
Commercial Real Estate Asset based finance
Corporate lending, Leveraged finance, Receivables
Food, Agri, Retail & Health finance
Corporate lending, Leveraged finance, Receivables
Industries & Manufacturing finance, Lease receivables
Infrastructure & Renewables Asset based finance
Offshore Energy Asset based finance
Shipping & Intermodal Asset based finance
Corporate lending, Leveraged finance, Receivables
Telecom, Media, Technology & Services finance, Lease receivables
The corporate client offering is characterised by a margin over volume strategy. This implies that we
are not a market-share player and do not originate for the sake of growing or consolidating our
position. We make deliberate choices about the sectors we want to be active in and the products we
want to offer to our clients. To be able to make these choices, we continuously reflect on our
position in the financial ecosystem. We analyse developments in our portfolio and identify
opportunities in the world around us. If we see an increase in risk, that does not fit our risk appetite,
we are able to adjust our focus and rebalance accordingly. On the other side, we are able to identify
and act on new opportunities with attractive earnings potential, as demonstrated by the growth in
lease receivables and the receivables finance portfolio. The drawn credit facility to Beequip increased
by 77% to EUR 371 million (2017: EUR 210 million). The receivables finance portfolio grew with
EUR 195 million to EUR 1.0 billion (2017: EUR 0.8 billion). This development is in line with the
strategy to increase the granularity of the corporate portfolio.
The asset based finance portfolios relate to more cyclical sectors such as Offshore Energy and
Shipping & Intermodal, and also include Commercial Real Estate and Infrastructure & Renewables.
Within Commercial Real Estate (CRE) we shifted from large single client exposures towards a.o.
more short-term development financing, resulting in an increasingly diversified portfolio. Within our
Infrastructure & Renewables portfolio we used to finance traditional infrastructure objects with a long
maturity. While we continue to serve our clients and help them throughout their business cycle, we
are shifting towards more digital infrastructure projects such as financing data centres and glass fibre
networks, with relatively shorter tenors compared to the traditional infrastructure portfolio. Both the
Offshore Energy and the Shipping & Intermodal portfolios have been actively managed, with prudent
new deal selection focused on well-secured transactions. The strong USD development has resulted
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 41
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
in a EUR 88 million appreciation of the balance sheet positions in these sectors. In combination with
the re- and prepayments and currency revaluation effects, this has already led to a reduction of our
Offshore Energy exposure. We plan to further reduce the exposure in these two cyclical sectors
going forward. While remaining open for new opportunities provided these are within our risk
appetite.
Regarding the fintech sector, we see opportunities to help our clients with our receivables financing
solutions, at times enhanced with minority equity stakes. Within fintech there are several fast growing
companies offering innovative solutions. In this industry, we aim to finance and cooperate with
companies that are not directly our competitors. We seek to have a mutually beneficial relationship
where we benefit from the technological knowledge of the fintech client and where the client
benefits from our financial knowledge and solutions.
In the leveraged finance market, we continue to observe lending conditions that do not sufficiently
reflect the risk characteristics in this asset class and thus are highly selective in the origination of new
transactions. After reflection on our leveraged finance positions in comparison to our risk appetite,
we decided to rebalance the leveraged finance exposure. This decision is representative of NIBC's
agility and ability to reflect on our market position and the trends in the market. The ability to
execute this decision is also reflected in the 14% decline of the leveraged finance exposure from
EUR 1.6 billion as at year-end 2017 to EUR 1.3 billion as at year-end 2018. Within the Leveraged
Finance portfolio we observe a relatively high number of impairments, confirming our view of the
growing imbalance between risks and rewards.
With our corporate lending product, we focus on mid-market companies predominantly active in the
Netherlands and Germany, and in the sectors Food, Agri, Retail & Health and Industries &
Manufacturing. We offer solutions to enable our clients’ growth and our solutions often evolve
around a decisive moment. We proactively adjust our commercial strategies and focus depending on
market circumstances and global trends. When doing business NIBC acts with an increased focus on
sustainability across all sectors in which we are active.
Mezzanine and Equity
In our mezzanine and equity offering, we focus on growth and succession financing, providing
subordinated debt and minority equity solutions for our clients. Often this goes hand-in-hand with
senior financing solutions, such that we provide a total solution for our clients. Also for these
products, we are looking for granular direct investments and lending solutions rather than large
investments in investment funds.
During 2018, we have reduced our portfolio of equity participations. As investment manager of NEIF,
NIBC has successfully executed the exit strategy of the fund, through the sale of two large portfolios.
In addition, the MBF 1B fund has successfully sold two investments. The profitable exit of these
investments is reflected in investment income for 2018. In total, the investment portfolio has been
reduced by EUR 128 million. In November 2018 the transaction regarding HSH Nordbank has been
closed. NIBC's total commitment of EUR 30 million is included in 'investments in funds'. At the end
of 2018, the equity investment portfolio amounts to EUR 215 million, including off-balance
commitments, divided over the following types of investments:
■ EUR 80 million direct investments;
■ EUR 97 million investments in funds;
■ EUR 24 million strategic investments in fintechs;
■ EUR 11 million real estate investments;
■ EUR 3 million other investments mainly related to the equity trading portfolio.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Corporate finance and capital markets
Similar to 2017, corporate finance had a successful year in 2018. We advised various clients, with the
most notable transaction being the acquisition of HSH Nordbank by a consortium including J.C.
Flowers & Co. We were advisor to the purchaser in the transaction.
In 2018, we further transformed our capital markets franchise into a primary capital markets business,
helping our clients seeking to attract debt or equity on the capital markets. Over the past year, we
participated in 17 Debt capital markets (DCM) transactions. Also in our Equities franchise, we saw an
increase in new clients, whom we serve with Equity capital markets (ECM) solutions, advisory
services and research.
Investment management
In the third quarter of 2018, NIBC successfully closed the North Westerly CLO V, a EUR 400 million
leveraged loan CLO. The transaction represents a continuation of NIBC's established and successful
North Westerly CLO franchise. This brings our total assets under management for corporate assets
to EUR 860 million by year end 2018.

Total corporate loan origination in 2018 amounted to EUR 3.6 billion, compared to EUR 3.1 billion in
2017. As prepayments remain at a high level, close to our total origination, the total corporate
lending book remained stable at EUR 9.7 billion. The equity investment portfolio declined due to the
sale of investments from both the NEIF and MBF 1B funds from EUR 343 million to EUR 215 million.
As a result total corporate client assets decreased marginally to EUR 9.9 billion (2017:
EUR 10.0 billion).
The level of investment income in 2018 increased to EUR 74 million, mainly caused by the successful
exits from the investment funds. Part of these sale results are considered to be non-recurring. The
lower level of the equity investment portfolio, combined with the strategy to build a more granular
equity investment portfolio implies that future income from this portfolio is expected to be below
the levels displayed in 2017 and 2018.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Credit loss expenses are impacted by stage 3 credit losses mainly stemming from Leveraged Finance
and Offshore Energy. Although we initiated the rebalancing strategy in 2018, this did not prevent the
occurrence of additional stage 3 credit losses.
Retail client offering
NIBC offers mortgage loans, buy-to-let mortgage loans and saving products to its retail clients. With
transparent pricing and conditions, these products help our clients executing or preparing for their
decisive moments. We do not provide general banking services such as payment solutions or current
accounts, allowing us to focus on products with which we can stand out. Retail client offering is active
in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.
Mortgages
NIBC only offers mortgage loans in the Netherlands. NIBC Direct mortgage loans are offered via
independent intermediaries throughout the Netherlands. The mortgage servicing and back-office
activities are outsourced to a third party. With this operational set up of our mortgage business, we
have created an efficient and scalable business. We continuously reflect on developments and the
options that our operational setup provides. By centralising back-office activities in 2018, we have
been able to make product and service changes towards clients easier, quicker, and more cost
effective. Futhermore our dual-track mortgage loans strategy has gained momentum by originating
mortgage loans for own balance sheet and for third party (institutional) investors. Over the course of
2018, we further created a one-stop-shop for intermediaries by supplying a full product range from
niche products to price competitive long-term interest rates mortgage loans.
As a result of our efforts in expanding the originate-to-manage business, mortgage origination
volumes increased significantly. In total, origination volumes increased by more than 80% to
EUR 3.4 billion in 2018. EUR 1.8 billion of the originated mortgage loans are originated for the
originate-to-manage proposition.
In 2018, we started the process of taking action to actively inform our clients about the terms and
conditions of an interest-only mortgage loan. Upon maturity the full mortgage loan needs to be
refinanced or repaid and research has shown that not all of our clients may be fully prepared for this.
NIBC is fully committed to resolve these issues together with our clients. As a first step we will start
contacting the most vulnerable clients in 2019 about possible personalised solutions. This effort is in
coordination with the Dutch Banking Association (NVB) and the AFM.
Mortgages for own book
The volume of mortgage loans recognised by NIBC increased from EUR 8.8 billion in 2017 (excluding
the fair value adjustment on FVtPL mortgage loans) to EUR 9.3 billion in 2018. In 2018, origination
for own book amounted to EUR 1.6 billion and re- and prepayments were EUR 1.1 billion. We
continued to focus on the more profitable segments of the mortgage market, outside of the NHG
market and focused on niches like self-employed, expats and buy-to-let. The Dutch housing market
price index further increased in 2018, leading to an increased credit quality of the portfolio. This is
reflected in the decrease in the amount of arrears on the mortgage portfolio which reduced from
EUR 42 million in 2017 to EUR 19 million in 2018. On the back of increased competition the buy-to-
let portfolio displayed a EUR 15 million marginal growth to a balance sheet total of EUR 632 million
in 2018.

Originate-to-manage mortgages
The current low interest rate environment has shifted consumer preference towards mortgage loans
with long fixed interest terms of 20 and 30 years. These long-term fixed products typically do not
suit the shorter maturity profile of a bank. The observed trend resulted in the launch of our originate-
to-manage (OTM) business in 2016. In this offering, we originate long fixed interest mortgage loans
under our own label and distribute the loans to institutional investors who seek these long duration
products. In the OTM offering, we have a strategic partnership with AXA Investment Managers, with
whom we currently have a mandate to originate a portfolio of EUR 3.5 billion mortgage loans. At
year-end 2018, the total portfolio amounted to EUR 2.4 billion.
Our position within the financial ecosystem enables us to cooperate with large financial institutions.
There are a number of unique selling points for our originate-to-manage product. As we do not
compete with these parties we do not have a natural conflict of interest, instead we have
complementary interests. The mortgage loans we originate for OTM carry the NIBC Direct brand,
the client has a contractual relationship with NIBC and the OTM mortgage follows exactly the same
(application) process as mortgage loans for own book. Furthermore, the investor has the flexibility in
determining what type of mortgages are originated. The strategic partner can for example choose
the length of the fixed interest term on the mortgages and whether or not the mortgage is covered
by the Dutch mortgage guarantee scheme (NHG). Next to this, NIBC can offer balance sheet support.
The strategic partner usually favours long duration mortgage loans. There are, however, cases where
the client needs short-term bridge financing. NIBC, with its balance sheet, can offer bridge financing
to the client, while the mortgage is transferred to our partner as soon as the loan is originated.
Further, NIBC has experience in mortgage origination and in managing mortgage loan portfolios. This
proves to be of vital importance in our role as a strategic partner to institutional investors.
Essential element of the OTM product is that NIBC has transferred all economic risks related to the
OTM mortgage loans. The loans are immediately sold to the strategic partner once a loan offer is
accepted by a client and distributed. Therefore, the OTM product does not result in on-balance
positions and consequently is not reflected in credit risk. NIBC’s income on the OTM mortgage
activity comes from the fees it receives for services provided to the strategic partner.
Savings
The savings products are an important pillar in the funding strategy of NIBC. NIBC’s savings products
are offered exclusively via the online channel in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. NIBC Direct
celebrated its 10th anniversary for its saving products in 2018. To celebrate this event together with
our clients, NIBC Direct colleagues visited several launching customers.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 45
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Active management of in- and outflow of deposits resulted in a decrease of the total retail savings
deposits in 2018 to EUR 8.9 billion (2017: EUR 9.3 billion), which fits within the bank’s funding
appetite. Within the savings portfolio, the share of on-demand deposits increased from 58% in 2017
to 61% in 2018. The shift towards more on-demand deposits results in lower funding costs. We
continue to evaluate our funding mix as a whole and possibilities to further diversify and strengthen
the retail savings offer within NIBC’s funding mix.
Performance
Profit after tax for the retail client offering improved compared to 2017 on the back of increasing fee
income from the OTM offering and a credit loss recovery.

The total mortgage loan book increased to EUR 9.3 billion due to EUR 1.6 billion of origination for
own book in 2018. The spread on mortgage loans, however, decreased by 17 basis points to 2.36%.
The decrease of the portfolio spread was caused by an increased share in origination of short-term
fixed rate mortgages, and lower loan-to-value (LtV) levels on our mortgage portfolio. Further, we
observed increased competition in the mortgage market, creating downward pressure on mortgage
rates.
In total, the decline in spread and the increase in the volume of mortgage loans resulted in a
EUR 3 million increase in net interest income. The IFRS 9 effects of the hedging swaps related to the
mortgage loans previously recognised at FVtPL are reflected in the Treasury & Group functions
income statement.
Net fee and commission income for the retail client offering fully reflects income from the originate-
to-manage business. The OTM proposition is one of the growth drivers in the income statement. As
both the amount of origination and the total originated portfolio increased substantially, fee income
from this product increased significantly. Evidence of our scalable retail client offering is the fact that
total operating expenses for retail clients remained stable, whereas the amount of mortgage loans
under management increased by 22% to EUR 11.7 billion.
46 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The improved state of the Dutch housing market, resulting in lower LtVs on mortgage loans, and
consequently reduced risks in our mortgage book. As the risk profile improved, credit loss recoveries
in 2018 amounted to EUR 8 million. At year-end the total impairment balance amounts to
EUR 8 million.
Treasury & Group functions
The net interest income impact from the pull-to-par effect related to IFRS 9 is attributed to treasury
& group functions. Total net interest income from IFRS 9 amounts to approximately EUR 50 million.
Next to IFRS 9 effects, net interest income increased due to the decrease of funding expenses. This is
driven by a further reduction of the effective funding spread from 0.87% to 0.73%.
Further, the previously explained EUR 17 million tax benefit due to the recognition at par of the tax
losses carry forwards from losses in 2010 and 2011 was also recognised within Treasury & Group
functions.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is at the core of our business and sustainable growth strategy. NIBC's approach to
risk management results in fast decision making through an experienced, client-focused origination
team with detailed knowledge of its client portfolio, allowing for risk exposure to be managed
through carefully structured facilities and client-centred restructuring on the corporate side. In the
retail offering risk is managed through simple and transparent products and an experienced arrears
management team aimed at preventing foreclosures. We mainly pursue credit and investment risk;
lowering our interest rate, currency, liquidity and operational risks while ensuring solid capital and
liquidity positions. These are integral aspects of the corporate and retail platform. Our risk appetite
defines the scope and boundaries we are comfortable with while our risk management framework
provides us with a structured approach for managing the various risks on a daily basis. It is
indispensable that sound risk management is rooted in our culture, as it is the responsibility of all our
people to service our clients over the long term in the way that they expect us to do, and in
relationships based on trust, transparency and reliability.
The origination philosophy is centred around the client relationship, understanding the client's cash
flow and the availability of collateral. In our corporate client offering we apply an integrated approach
to managing credit risk by focusing on risk-adjusted returns. We assess whether a new opportunity
fits our risk appetite, and evaluate commercial and compliance matters prior to engaging with any
particular client. In this process we consider credit risk and financial market risk as part of the
decision process and conduct risk assessments prior to making the final lending decision. The ultimate
decision is dependent on our comfort with the specific client. In our retail client offering we apply a
conservative approach to new products and use programme lending for regular mortgage loans. The
Restructuring & Distressed Assets (RDA) department is highly experienced, and typically engaged at an
early stage of client financial distress to maximise the probability of a successful work-out and to limit
potential losses. In addition, sophisticated tools are used to model credit risk, such as internally
developed methodologies under the AIRB approach.
Our business actively supports mid-sized corporates and new ventures at their most decisive
moments. For retail clients we aim to support them at their decisive moments, e.g. when buying a
house. Therefore, it is vital that we have the room to be inventive in our approach. Although it is the
nature of our business to investigate alternative solutions and facilitate exceptions to the standard in
order to service our clients efficiently, we benchmark potential transactions against our risk appetite
framework.
NIBC has the advantage of its medium scale and the close proximity and collaboration there is
between colleagues and with its client base. This provides a setting in which a quick and efficient
multidisciplinary approach can be taken in areas of risk management. We therefore have the capacity
to keep moving forward as a business while we continue to comply with evolving regulatory
requirements.
Developments in risk management
Despite the generally positive economic climate there are uncertainties in the world that may have an
adverse effect on NIBC. The looming threat of a 'hard Brexit', continued geopolitical tensions
impacting global trade, increasing number of profit warnings in Germany, lower GDP growth
expectations for EU member states and continued volatility in financial markets are examples of
challenges for both NIBC and our clients. Within the financial industry we observe increasing risks in
the leveraged finance market and the continuing low interest rate environment. We are constantly
reflecting on our position in the financial industry and apply a careful approach to areas where we
48 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
see an increased level of riskiness, while at the same time benefiting from identified opportunities in
other sectors and products.
Throughout 2018 we have continued to improve the asset quality of our lending book. Important
aspect to achieve that improvement is the rebalancing of our portfolios, aimed at higher granularity of
exposures and smaller portfolios in certain sectors and products. Although impairments are still at an
elevated level, driven by credit losses on a small number of individual clients within Leveraged
Finance, Offshore Energy and Shipping & Intermodal, we see the first effects in the underlying
portfolios. The interest rate risk management framework has been revised in 2018, leading to a more
efficient hedging model and reduction of the volume of derivatives.
In the area of non-financial risks, client due diligence is an important topic, as banks fulfil an important
role in the prevention of intentional and unintentional wrongdoing. Know-your-customer (KYC) and
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations are updated to meet today's challenges, and banks have to
keep pace by adjusting their processes and procedures in order to address the risks effectively and
remain compliant with these regulations . NIBC actively reviews and adjusts the client onboarding
processes to keep these in line with continuously evolving requirements.
Another important development we monitored closely during 2018 relates to Brexit. We remain in
close contact with the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and DNB to follow the
latest developments and to ensure we can continue to operate in the UK. NIBC is in the process of
completing its entry into the Temporary Permissions Regime. This regime will ensure that financial
institutions can continue operating in the UK – post a hard-Brexit – essentially on the same basis as
before. Further, ISDA agreements with UK counterparties who transfer their positions to an EU
entity have been redrafted, and we invited our clients to have a dialogue on the effects of Brexit for
them.
Developments with regard to Brexit are closely monitored. We remain in close contact with the
Dutch and UK regulators to follow the latest developments, identify necessary adjustments and to
ensure we can continue to operate in the UK. Additionally, NIBC has invited its clients to have a
dialogue on the effects of Brexit on their business and operations.
As a regulated entity we continuously focus on the non-financial risks relating to doing business. As
NIBC is increasingly becoming dependent on its outsourcing partners, which is a trend in the industry,
we also expect all outsourcing partners to comply with the three lines of defense model. More
regulation is expected to come into effect to formalise these relationships and responsibilities in the
complete process. This is expected to include both the contractual and the process ownership.
Risk governance
The overarching principles regarding risk management are laid down in our risk management
framework. The ultimate purpose is to enable ourselves to properly assess in a timely manner
whether our activities fit within our risk appetite and to provide insight into how we address
opportunities and challenges that various types of risk present.
Three lines of defence model
Our operations are structured along the three lines of defence risk management model. This implies
that the first line of defence is within the commercial business units. They are accountable and
responsible for day-to-day risk management activities such as managing each individual exposure on
the balance sheet, with the exception of distressed assets at the corporate bank. These assets are
managed by the RDA department which is part of the risk management organisation. The
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 49
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
management and responsibility of the first line of defence lies with the non-statutory members of the
Executive Committee (ExCo).
Our second line of defence lies within the Risk, Legal, Compliance and CSR departments. These
departments monitor and evaluate risks versus the risk appetite framework. The second line of
defence has an active advisory role in particular transactions and proposals. The CRO is head of the
second line.
The third line of defence is the Internal Audit (IA) department. This department provides objective
and independent assurance on the operations within the first and second lines of defence. IA helps to
accomplish our objectives by evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control
and governance. IA reports directly to the CEO and the Audit Committee.
NIBC will focus on further development of the three lines of defence model to address modern ways

new arrangements to clearly assign responsibilities to the different parties involved in the related

Client privacy and data security
When confidential or private information belongs to NIBC or a client, we handle it with the utmost
care. Cybercrime is a risk for NIBC as well as for all of our financial sector peers. In 2018 we carried
out a large number of tests, continuously assessing our data protection measures, as part of our
efforts to strengthen NIBC's cyber security.
We do not leave such information unattended and we have policies such as a clear desk policy,
information security policies, and additional security controls. Staff may not use non-secure
communication channels or storage devices for sensitive or confidential information. Third parties
may not use our equipment, software or databases unless authorised. Our approach is detailed in our
Corporate Information Security Policy and our Data Protection Policy. We have a Record Keeping
Policy in place to ensure we adhere to legal requirements with respect to data protection. During
2018, NIBC reported 18 incidents to authorities and clients. There were no severe leaks, thefts, or
losses of customer data nor any complaints regarding severe breaches of customer privacy and losses
of customer data.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Anti-fraud and anti-corruption
All staff received mandatory training on NIBC’s Code of Conduct as well as on related compliance
policies such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery. These awareness and
learning initiatives demonstrate NIBC’s ongoing commitment towards good corporate governance
and to uphold the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).
In line with our commitment to the principles of the UNGC, NIBC does not accept or tolerate any
instance of bribery, corruption or fraud. Any NIBC employee found giving or accepting bribes, or
committing any other acts of corruption, will face disciplinary action. NIBC does not want to engage
with clients who have consistently violated the UNGC principles and do not provide any level of
commitment to improve.
Our anti-fraud framework emphasises prevention and timely detection. All staff are responsible for
the prevention, detection and deterrence of fraud. We familiarise ourselves with the types of
improprieties that might occur within our area of responsibility, and are alert to any indication of
irregularity. We always report actual or suspected fraud or misconduct, after which a special
investigation is launched, if appropriate. If fraud is established, action will be taken against violators.
Risk appetite framework
Our strategy towards risk management is translated into the risk appetite framework. This framework
is based on six pillars:
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 51
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
In the risk appetite framework these six pillars are further specified into specific business statements.
Each quarter the relevant committees, and the Managing Board review whether our quantitative and
qualitative performance is in line with the risk appetite.
Roles and responsibilities
NIBC has several committees in place with specific authorities and decision-making power with
respect to risk management:
■ Engagement committee (EC): Responsible for decision-making with regard to client
engagement and conflicts of interest including an assessment of the potential integrity risks when
engaging with a client.
■ Transaction committee (TC): The transaction committee has decision-making power with
regards to credit transactions, assessment of credit proposals and the monitoring of credit related
risks. The TC approves and monitors all transaction proposals which cause NIBC to assume credit
risk. Further, the TC decides on impairments and write-offs and reviews all individual transactions
at least annually.
■ Investment committee (IC): The IC is the delegated authority to decide on equity, mezzanine,
subordinated, and other equity related financial products. The IC assesses new investment
proposals and periodically determines the valuation of our equity portfolio.
■ Strategic investment committee (SIC):The SIC has decision-making power on equity,
mezzanine debt, subordinated debt and senior debt granted to strategic participations and/or
strategic investments.
■ Risk management committee (RMC): The RMC decides on policies, measurement methods,
monitoring, and controlling of all risk types. The role of the RMC is to safeguard our risk appetite
by monitoring all risks we are exposed to, thereby looking backwards as well as forwards.
■ Asset & liability committee (ALCO): The ALCO monitors and controls capital ratios, liquidity,
earnings and market risk. As ALCO is responsible for liquidity, they also decide on funding plans
and large funding transactions.
Risk profile
Our business is organised in such a way that we place great emphasis on who the client is. Second,
we base our lending decisions on cash flows as this is what ultimately repays our loans. And third, we
are primarily a collateralised lender and this is an important determinant in reducing the risk profile of
the bank. We have a preference to finance well-collateralised products such as receivables and
mortgage loans on real estate.
In order to reduce the risk profile we have to look beyond our lending activities. One of the non-
lending activities relates to minority equity participations in clients and investment funds. In 2018 the
equity investment portfolio decreased from EUR 343 million to EUR 215 million. Reduction of the
equity investment exposure is primarily explained by the sale of investments from NEIF and MBF 1B,
decreasing the exposure by EUR 155 million. On the new investment side we have focused on
smaller exposures, increasing granularity of the equity investment portfolio.
In 2018 the risk profile of the performing corporate loan portfolio continued to improve as
evidenced by the decrease of the expected loss to 31 bps (2017: 32 bps). Origination with lower
expected credit loss than the existing portfolio has contributed to this reduction. The watch list of
corporate loan exposures decreased from EUR 508 million to EUR 261 million. This indicates an
improving portfolio, although part of the outflow is related to newly impaired assets. These
impairments mostly relate to the Offshore Energy sector, which continues to experience pressure
from price levels and uncertainties in the oil market, and Leveraged Finance products, which are
currently displaying risk characteristics that are less in line with our risk appetite. Within the Shipping
52 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
& Intermodal portfolio the amount of non-performing loans increased in 2018. This was due to the
continuation of the deteriorated market circumstances and our decision to take relatively small
impairments totalling EUR 7 million on four exposures. Shipping & Intermodal assets are well
collateralised and therefore impairments are relatively limited. The non-performing exposure in
Industries & Manufacturing, mostly consisting of Leveraged Finance products, more than doubled.
The sectors and products above remain challenging, and consistent with our rebalancing strategy we
decided to decrease exposures to Offshore Energy, Shipping & Intermodal and Leveraged Finance. In
2018 this has already resulted in a decreased Leverage Finance exposure. Growth in the corporate
client portfolio comes from our more granular offerings such as receivables financing and lease
receivables, which is in line with the strategy to increase granularity of NIBC's exposures.
The housing market in the Netherlands has continued to improve in 2018. This is reflected in the
performing mortgage loan portfolio by a decrease of the expected loss from 13 bps to 9 bps. In
2018 shorter tenor mortgage loan origination has also added to the rebalancing of our risk profile
within the retail portfolio. Shorter tenors also provide repricing power, more flexibility and lower
liquidity risk. Rebalancing the portfolios should position NIBC to address the challenges.
Overview of risk types
NIBC is exposed to a wide range of risks. We distinguish the following: credit risk, investment risk,
interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. Our risk management policy is aimed
at seeking an acceptable level of credit and investment risk, while minimising the other risk types. The
risk appetite framework is set-up to accommodate decision making.
The following table displays a breakdown of our exposures and the types of risk associated with that
exposure. The amounts include both drawn and undrawn amounts. In the remainder of the section
we will elaborate on the various risk types and the way we manage these.

Credit risk
Credit risk is one of the risks inherent to our business model. By lending to our clients we are
exposed to the risk of the counterparty not being able to repay the loan. We continuously monitor
our clients' financial performance and take remedial action if we believe the risk of a client defaulting
on their obligation has increased.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 53
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
We mitigate credit risk by placing emphasis on the collateral pledged to us in the transactions we do.
In case a client defaults on its obligation, the option to collect and sell the collateral can be exercised
as a last resort, thereby significantly reducing the amount of non-recoverable assets.

As indicated in previous paragraphs, we have seen a changing balance between the risks and rewards
in the Offshore Energy, Shipping & Intermodal and Leveraged Finance sectors. As a consequence we
have deliberately chosen to be more conservative and reduce our exposures in these sectors. We
seek to grow in granular products such as receivable financing which is demonstrated by the increase
in the sectors Telecom, Media, Technology & Services (TMT&S) and Industries & Manufacturing (I&M),
as well as the growth in lease receivables.

In the corporate client offering we mainly engage with clients rated a 5 or 6 on the internal credit risk
scale, which corresponds to a BB and B in external rating agencies' scales. This translates to a
probability of default ranging between 0.61% and 4.77%. As the exposures are concentrated in the
sub-investment grade category, we emphasise the collateral pledged to us. Collateral can take several
forms, such as receivables and leases, but also mortgages on real estate and vessels. As a result, our
loss given default (LGD) on corporate loans is typically in the range of 10% to 25%.
The Dutch housing market showed further strengthening in 2018, which is reflected in the credit loss
reversals we report on the mortgage loans. In the retail client offering, where we offer mortgage
loans to our clients, three different types of mortgages are distinguished from a risk perspective:
owner-occupied mortgage loans with NHG, owner-occupied mortgage loans without NHG, and buy-
to-let mortgage loans. NHG refers to the Dutch mortgage guarantee scheme that ensures that the
lender is compensated for post-foreclosure losses on mortgage loans. A good indicator of the
riskiness of a mortgage loan is the loan-to-value ratio. The Dutch housing market has displayed
considerable improvements over the past years, causing loan-to-value ratios in our mortgage loan
portfolio to further decrease.

Development of credit quality
In determining the credit quality of the loan book we look at four measures indicating an increased
risk level. We differentiate between the following measures:
■ Forborne exposure: defined by the European Banking Authority (EBA). A client is considered to be
forborne if the client is facing financial difficulties and NIBC has granted a concession over and
beyond market practice to the borrower;
■ Non-performing exposure: is defined in line with the EBA. A client is considered non-performing if
that client is in default, or if a performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional
forbearance measures, or becomes more than 30 days past-due;
■ Defaulted exposure: as defined by the CRR / CRD IV definition. A counterparty is considered to
be in default when credit review leads to the conclusion that the probability of default is 100%;
■ Impaired exposure: defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting
standard. Facilities are considered to be impaired if the Transaction Committee (TC) decides on an
impairment amount for that facility.
Due to our medium size, we are able to oversee the portfolio and have thorough knowledge of the
specific situations our clients are in. This positions us well to identify potential threats at an early
stage, enabling us to intensify contact with the client. If the situation persists and the credit quality of a
client begins to weaken, the client is placed on our watch list. From this moment onwards we start to
closely monitor the developments at the client with the goal to work with our client to resolve credit
issues early and to avoid further deterioration. The watch list consists of exposures that show an
increased level of riskiness but are not managed by the RDA department. The reduction of credit risk
becomes the main priority once an exposure is transferred to the watch list. For watch list items we
require a quarterly review if the exposure exceeds EUR 10 million and a semi-annual review if the
exposure is smaller than EUR 10 million. If the situation at the client deteriorates further and the
probability of default significantly increases, the file is transferred to RDA where several options for
minimising losses are drafted and executed.
In the retail client offering we are exposed to credit risk through mortgage loans. Clients receive
transparent and clear conditions on these products. In case a client faces financial distress resulting in
arrears, the file is transferred to our in-house arrears management team. Subsequently we will
contact the client to determine the source of the financial distress and to make a plan to prevent
foreclosure. As a client-focused bank it is in our culture to cooperate with clients to prevent
foreclosure.

1 Impairment coverage ratio includes IFRS 9 stage 3 assets only.
2 Impairment coverage ratio excludes IBNR amounts.
The increase in non-performing exposures for FAR&H, I&M and TMT&S are mainly related to
leveraged finance assets. The decrease in the non-performing and impaired exposure in CRE is partly
due to the write-down of two impaired exposures and a significant repayment of an impaired client.
Besides former non-performing exposures improving into performing, write-downs also partially
explain the decrease in non-performing exposure in Offshore Energy.
The increase in impaired mortgage loan exposure is due to the transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9. The
impaired exposure mainly relates to mortgage loans previously held at FVtPL which are recognised at
amortised cost as of 1 January 2018. As FVtPL assets do not have impairments – instead they have
fair value losses – they were not included in the impaired exposure under IAS 39 reporting. The
decrease in the non-performing exposure for mortgage loans is primarily caused by the write-off of
fully provisioned post-foreclosure arrears that were included in the 2017 positions. These arrears
were long overdue and had a fair value of zero on the balance sheet. During 2018, it has been
decided to write down the full post-foreclosure amount.

Investment risk
For NIBC, investment risk arises when taking equity positions in other companies and the risk is that
the value of the investment deteriorates. Within our equity portfolio we distinguish between direct
and indirect investments. Direct investments are equity exposures with which NIBC has directly
invested in one of its clients, whereas indirect investments are exposures to investment funds.
58 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The NEIF fund has successfully executed its exit strategy and sold a number of investments in 2018,
considerably reducing the amount of investments in the portfolio. This development is in line with
NIBC's strategy of reducing large single-client exposures which also applies to the investment
portfolio. As a result we are looking for smaller direct investments in our clients, preferably through
offering a combination of senior and mezzanine lending, combined with an equity participation.

Interest rate risk in the banking book
Interest rate risk in the banking book refers to the sensitivity of interest income to adverse interest
rate movements. Interest rate movements have an impact on cash flows and their present values.
NIBC has a framework in place which keeps track of interest related risks in our economic value and
our earnings. To monitor the impact on economic value, basis point value (BPV) and value at risk
(VaR) are calculated on a daily basis. 
To assess the impact on net interest income NIBC uses earnings at risk (EaR) by calculating the 12-
months earnings impact of a gradual 100 bps and 200 bps upward or downward shift in interest rates
per currency. At the end of 2018 the 100 bps EaR amounted to EUR 13 million (2017:
EUR 13 million). Next to this, NIBC uses several dynamic analyses by modelling the development of
its balance sheet in line with the business plan, taking into account refinancing and reinvestments.
In principle NIBC hedges all interest positions to 3-month EURIBOR/LIBOR by applying plain vanilla
swaps. During 2018, NIBC further optimised its interest hedging structure. This resulted in more
efficient use of on-balance sheet hedging and a lower hedging swap exposure at year-end. Only a
certain part of the interest bearing assets related to our non-interest bearing capital is unhedged. This
is identified as the strategic mismatch exposure.
The European Benchmark Regulation (BMR) which will come into force in 2020 has an impact on the
risk-free rate, currently EONIA and EURIBOR. EONIA will be replaced by European Short Term Rate
(ESTER) and there may be a change in the determination of EURIBOR, or a complete replacement.
The transition towards these new rates requires adjustments in ISDA agreements, loan
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 59
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
documentation, risk management, interest rate risk hedging and hedge accounting. NIBC has set-up a
project team to investigate the impact and implement the required changes.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates,
exchange rates and share prices, as well as other variables that are not directly observable, such as
volatilities and correlations.
In the trading book, excluding NIBC Markets, NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and
USD yield curves. The limits for the trading book are moderate and are monitored on a daily basis
and reported to the Asset and Liability Committee on a biweekly basis. NIBC’s policy is not to take
any active currency positions. When currency positions exceed small facilitating limits, NIBC’s policy is
to enter into hedging transactions. NIBC’s overall open foreign currency position was EUR 5.7 million
as at 31 December 2018.
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk (in the trading book only) and
credit spread risk (in both the trading and banking books). The capital requirement for market risk is
based on internal models for the trading book, excluding NIBC Markets, and on the Standardised
Approach for NIBC Markets. The capital requirement for the overall foreign currency position of the
bank is calculated in accordance with the Standardised Approach.
The objectives of the market risk function are to measure, report and limit the market risk of NIBC
in accordance with NIBC’s market risk framework. NIBC has defined interest rate risk, credit spread
risk and traded equity risk limits and monitors their positions on a daily basis, reporting to the Asset
and Liability Committee once every two weeks. The risk management and control function is
independent of any trading activities. Any significant breach of market risk limits is required to be
reported to the CRO for immediate action. Market risk analyses all 'overshootings' (i.e. occasions
where either the hypothetical or actual profit and loss account exceeds the VaR) in the trading book
and reports them to both the CRO and the DNB in accordance with Article 366 point 5 of the
CRR.
NIBC uses multiple risk metrics to monitor and manage market risk. These include interest BPV,
credit BPV, interest VaR and credit VaR. These metrics are calculated on a daily basis and are
reviewed by the market risk department.
In addition to the VaR, NIBC has developed a number of stress tests. These stress tests consist of
both historical events and potential extreme market conditions. Market risk stress tests are
conducted and reported regularly, both at portfolio level and on a consolidated basis.
Liquidity risk
The risk of not being able to meet obligations as they become due is called liquidity risk. The aim is to
maintain a comfortable liquidity position to enable ourselves to fund new client assets, as well as to
repay our debts when it becomes due. Managing the maturity of both assets and liabilities is key in
successful liquidity risk management and we maintain sufficient liquidity buffers to meet our
obligations in a potential stress scenario.
The responsibility for managing liquidity risk lies with the ALCO. Liquidity requirement forecasts from
the corporate and retail client businesses, combined with the associated liquidity forecasts and several
stress scenarios are presented to ALCO every two weeks.
60 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The management of liquidity risk entails that we have a diverse source of funding types, so we can tap
into any of the various funding markets if we require new funding. When a certain funding source
suddenly becomes unavailable or unattractive for NIBC, we have alternative sources available to
attract the required funding.
During 2018 we continued to actively manage the funding mix and tenor. The amount of secured
funding increased due to the issuance of two 10-year covered bonds and one 5-year RMBS
transaction.

Operational risk
Operational risk can be described as the risk of direct or indirect losses from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people and systems or from external events. NIBC regards legal risk, reputational
risk and compliance risk as part of operational risk. Examples of operational risk include fraud,
systems failure, discrimination and data errors.
NIBC strives for a ‘no surprises’ operating environment, managing operational risk across all our
business lines, banking activities and countries in a transparent and consistent way. Key is that every
NIBC business unit and international office (first line) has an operational risk ‘champion’. These
employees assess their department’s activities for potential operational risks, monitor the control
mechanisms in place to mitigate these, coordinate ways of resolving loss-making events and promote
awareness for operational risks within their departments. This has created a valuable network of
experts that shares its knowledge and expertise across the bank.
Regulators and society are increasingly interested in operational risk factors and what we as a bank
do to prevent any wrongdoing. Increased attention is placed on KYC and Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) measures. For more information on these subjects and how we actively manage these risks
within the first line, please refer to the SWOT analysis section.
Capital adequacy
The most important ratio to assess our capital position is the CET 1 ratio. Related to this measure
are the Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios. These ratios are calculated based on CRR / CRD IV
regulations.
To assess the capital ratios at year-end we need to differentiate between the impact of the transition
to IFRS 9 and the developments in 2018. The IFRS 9 transition had a significant capital impact, as
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 61
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
explained in the Financial review. During 2018 the capital ratios were impacted positively by the
increased profitability in 2018 and reduced RWAs, mainly driven by the exits in the investment
portfolio. 
Operational risk RWAs are determined by a 3-year moving average of operating income. As
operating income increased over the past years, so did the RWAs related to operational risk.

Economic capital
In addition to regulatory capital, Economic Capital (EC) is also calculated. EC is the amount of capital
needed as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based on our assessment of risks. It
differs from Basel's regulatory capital calculation, as specific risk characteristics of the business
activities are assessed in a different manner than the required regulatory methodology. The EC is
based on a one-year horizon with a 99.9% confidence level. This confidence level means that there is
a probability of 0.1% that losses in a period of one year will be larger than the allocated EC.

OUR PEOPLE
NIBC strives to make a difference at decisive moments for its clients. Consequently, the continuous
development of employees’ capabilities and commitment are pivotal. The NIBC3, our corporate
values – professional, entrepreneurial and inventive - are the cornerstone for NIBC’s organisation and
culture. The values best sum up NIBC and the way we operate. They not only define us in terms of
our products and services, but are also the basis for our performance management framework, our
development and training activities and our approach to recruitment and selection. These values are
also reflected in our ‘Think YES’ campaign.
We evaluate ourselves and each other in accordance with these values. By doing so we link our
external promise to the internal culture and capacity to deliver. These values are being applied
consistently throughout the organisation in both the front and back offices and at all levels as part of
the performance management framework.
Employee base
In 2018, our total headcount decreased to 683 employees, from 689 in 2017. The total FTE at
31 December 2018 was 657 (2017: 666). This small decrease mainly relates to some small
adjustments in the organisation.

Employee engagement
We want to enable our employees to make a difference at decisive moments for our clients, by
offering them a good employee experience. In 2018 we held an Employee Experience Survey to find
out how our employees rate our culture, our leadership and their work experience by measuring the
levels of engagement and commitment in our organisation.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 63
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The survey is in line with NIBC’s effort to build a positive and open culture in which we recognise
employees by celebrating their success and sharing feedback. Each manager leading a team with more
than five employee responses received a feedback report. Managers and employees jointly discussed
the outcomes of the Employee Experience Survey to develop an action plan.
As announced in 2018 we selected a new provider of the engagement survey. As a consequence the
results of 2018 are not comparable with previous years. In order to track and monitor the results of
NIBC we will, as of 2019, define targets to maintain or improve engagement levels compared to the
previous year.
High participation (79%) in the survey provided solid insights, which led to the identification of the
organisation’s strengths and opportunities. The proportion of committed employees (commitment
refers to the connection our employees feel towards our organisation) is 73% which is a positive
result but also leaves room for improvement. Our focus on leadership, e.g. through courses, coaching
and round-tables on themes regarding management and leadership, has led to a good score of 76%.
Another important organisational performance indicator, employership, which gives an indication
whether we enable employees to perform optimally, scored a satisfactory 72%. The level of
engagement in the financial sector (engagement is the degree to which employees get inspiration
from their work) is significantly lower than in other sectors. In our view this is one of the most critical
success factors going forward. We therefore aim to increase our current score of 38%. To realise this
we will pay attention to working efficiently, communication and perceived workload. We continue to
raise awareness and understanding of health and wellness issues amongst our employees to keep on
boosting their vitality and productivity. Furthermore we continue to invest in the development of our
employees by offering them feedback, coaching and training, development programs and e-learnings.
Development
To compete effectively in our industry, we must develop ourselves at a faster pace and to a higher
standard than many of our (larger) competitors. Competition is tough within the financial services
industry as a whole and in the labour market the banking sector is still perceived as less attractive
than before the financial crisis. But, as a mid-sized bank we have, in some ways, a more compelling
offer for employees than our larger peers; one in which they will have greater responsibilities,
influence and impact from the start. The ‘Think YES’ campaigns have helped to position NIBC in the
highly competitive labour market.
In 2018, we spent over EUR 3,200 per employee on training and educational programmes. This is
close to the top quartile when benchmarked with financial services, and close to the top decile
compared to general industries. The amount is significantly higher than in 2017 (EUR 2,300) mainly
driven by the introduction of a personal development budget for all staff, enabling and motivating
them to further develop themselves and by this also contribute to their employability. Moreover,
these investments increase the professional capabilities and competences of our people.
Human capital
NIBC invests significantly in human capital, developing its people personally and professionally, and
providing a stimulating work environment that values diversity and treats everyone with respect.
NIBC has zero tolerance for all forms of discrimination with respect to employment and occupation
including verbal, physical and sexual harassment. Furthermore, we have systems and processes in
place to actively manage and stimulate equal compensation.
64 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
We adhere to national employment legislation in the countries in which we are active and comply
with best practices. Respecting and protecting human rights and embracing diversity are embedded in
our Code of Conduct.
In this light, we are very proud that NIBC’s Ellen Dekker was a nominee in the Young Talent category
of the 2018 Women of the Year awards (Topvrouw van het Jaar). Twenty-six candidates from leading
Dutch corporates were nominated under the theme of 'empowering young female talent' These
awards help to promote cultural change and raise awareness for corporate gender diversity.
NIBC Introduction Programme
The NIBC Introduction Programme was organised on a regular basis in 2018 to enhance the
onboarding of new employees. Besides presentations on the strategy of the bank and on various
parts of organisation, special attention was paid to the importance of our corporate values, the
NIBC3. All new employees have taken the Bankers’ Oath.
NIBC Academy
We have a solid training and learning offering in the NIBC Academy, our virtual centre for continuous
training and learning, enabling us to offer development in a more customised and effective way. It ran
a total of 25 modular courses in 2018. The Academy's approach is to empower employees to take
responsibility for their own development, through a range of channels, including on-demand online
workshops and classroom courses. Staff can also create their own learning initiatives, as a result of
which we also offer training courses that are offered by employees who are subject matter experts.
Besides developing professional skills we increasingly focus on skills that make our staff more inventive
and entrepreneurial. Our Dare2Develop programme is a clear example. This one year invitation-only
programme is aimed at our talented young professionals at associate and vice-president level. The
programme is developed in close cooperation with the participants and enhances personal
effectiveness in influencing, consulting, negotiation and innovation. The connection with NIBC’s
strategy is made by deep dive business cases and the active involvement of senior management
through mentoring and coaching.
Other examples of NIBC's efforts to support its staff to continuously develop are the following:
■ To build on our basic financial and lending skills, in 2018 we offered a number of professional
training courses such as Financial & Cashflow Analysis and a Fitch Credit Course.
■ We continue to support new ways of working through a high number of IT and application related
courses that are available to all personnel.
■ The Management Development Programme and ‘Influencing with Impact’ training courses have
continued to help develop employees' personal and management skills.
■ A total of 26 participants completed our dedicated Talent Programme in 2018. This Talent
Programme for young bankers has been designed to appeal to a new generation of bankers. A
complete new set-up was launched in January 2018. The modular and flexible approach of this
renewed set-up is even more tailored to the needs and demands of the new generation.
■ A group of 20 talented employees participated in the Orchestrating Winning Performance
programme of IMD in Lausanne. In this energetic programme they gained the newest insights on
various business and management topics.
Recruitment and Young NIBC
Recruitment efforts have continued to include engagement with selected student associations, for
which we organised several in-house days and attended various recruitment events. By organising an
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 65
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
event for recent interns and their friends we were able to attract and hire new talents who match
our ambitions and culture.
At the same time, we have become more inventive in our recruitment efforts and are using new and
more dynamic channels, such as gamification, social media and other online platforms. These enable
us to engage with a more diverse group of talents and help to convey what working at NIBC is really
like.
Young NIBC
The Young NIBC network is focused on connecting younger NIBC staff to each other and the bank.
Young NIBC identifies their needs and facilitates matching events, with a focus on personal
development, learning about NIBC’s organisation and culture and creating a professional network.
One of the Young NIBC activities in 2018 was a visit to a client in Berlin, a fintech company. Over
thirty of our young colleagues learned about their way of working and how to apply this at NIBC.
Social responsibility is highly valued in Young NIBC. In 2018, several young colleagues were given the
opportunity to participate in the Face-the-Future Programme, directed to connect refugees in The
Netherlands (or ‘newcomers’) to corporate employees. Moreover, Young NIBC organised the NIBC
'Young for the Young' Challenge which entailed 25 young colleagues and Stichting Vitalis (an
organisation supporting children in need of extra care and attention), working together to find a
solution for minimising the waiting list.
Banking on trust
At NIBC we are mindful of our responsibility towards helping build and maintain trust in the financial
services industry. We believe trust is the foundation on which our sector must be based, and we have
consistently looked to make it the basis of our own company’s culture. To support this aim, we have
continued to run our Banking on Trust programme and made concerted efforts through our focus
on sustainable culture and behaviour. Each month the Managing Board takes the Bankers' Oath from
all new employees, thereby emphasising the importance of trust in our behaviour.
During the year, we continued the Compliance & Integrity awareness programme that is based on
our revised Code of Conduct, and reflects the most up-to-date standards in our industry. This
dedicated programme has continued to raise employees’ awareness about our Compliance &
Integrity policy framework for dealing with integrity related matters, e.g. through a mandatory Code
of Conduct/Compliance e-learning. The Compliance & Integrity training is also obligatory for all new
employees when they join NIBC.
Promoting inclusiveness and diversity
We believe that diversity is critical to our ability to succeed and achieve sustainable success. We are
committed to creating a stimulating work environment for people from all backgrounds, that is open
to different ways of thinking. In 2018, we continued to pay close attention to all elements of our
diversity goals.
Diversity across age segments showed balance in 2018. 19% of our employees were under 30 years
of age (2017: 18%) and 23% of employees were age 50 or older (2017: 23%).
The gender diversity for our organisation slightly increased to 32% female staff (2017: 31%). Senior
management also reported an increase in gender diversity to 15% (2017: 12%). We are fully
committed to further continue our efforts and structural attention concerning inclusiveness and
gender diversity.
66 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
We realise that improving diversity ratios is a long-term process and will continue to strive to meet
our ambitions. We have a Diversity Committee in place which is tasked with researching our current
behaviours and recommending ways to achieve a more inclusive environment at NIBC. We took
steps to increase diversity across the company through our recruitment processes. And diversity in
general, and the male-female balance specifically, are also explicitly taken into account in our talent
programmes and performance management. To address gender imbalances specifically, we have
introduced engagements, like mentorships and dedicated workshops and programmes, aimed at
retaining and further developing talented female employees.
Increasing diversity among senior managers was a key focus area in 2018. Our objective is at least
one third of our Supervisory Board and Managing Board members to be female. NIBC's Executive
Committee meets this objective. NIBC is aware that it falls short of this goal with respect to the
Managing Board (nil on a total of three) and the overall senior positions (director level and higher),
although here the percentage increased to 15% (from 12% in 2017). With regard to the Supervisory
Board, the ratio of 29% is close to our objective.
NIBC will continue to address this topic as high-priority. In the case of a vacancy in the Managing
Board or the Supervisory Board, the regular policy is applied in which we ask the executive search to
shortlist at least 50% female candidates.
Pensions and benefits
Revisions in previous years have allowed us to operate a modern set of employee benefits, which are
flexible and better aligned to the realities of our business. An important aspect is the discretionary
approach to compensation and benefits, which takes into account a range of considerations, including
KPIs and country-wide benchmarks. This enables us to reward our talented staff well and to retain
them.
Similarly, our pension plan is a collective-defined contribution (CDC) scheme for salaries up to
EUR 105,075, ensuring that pension costs have become predictable. As of 2018 the contribution for
NIBC is determined at 26.2% and the contribution of the employee at 4.2%, whilst the gross
contribution by NIBC for pensions above the fiscal maximum is set at 25% for all ages.
Health and safety
A healthy workforce is a key element in achieving the our objectives. We executed a range of
programmes and initiatives in 2018, to enhance our people’s well-being.
We continued to promote a good work-life balance and to incorporate new ways to increase
flexibility in how we work. In that respect NIBC joined the Virgin Global Challenge focusing on vitality,
through a.o. exercise, nutrition and work-life balance. The Challenge combined attention to lifestyle
with an internal competition, which created a positive atmosphere within NIBC. This led to a high
participation: approximately 70% of all employees, from all the offices, participated in 70 teams
aiming to increase a healthy and active lifestyle.
With the health and safety programmes and initiatives, NIBC has contributed in a positive way to the
low absenteeism rate of 2.1% in 2018.
Works Council
NIBC’s Works Council (Council) represents the interests of all staff based in the Netherlands. It
currently has 11 members from all departments and levels across the bank. As the voice of the
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 67
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
employees, the Council regularly meets with the members of the Managing Board and HR team in
both formal and informal settings. Twice a year it meets with members of the Supervisory Board.
Since 2014, NIBC has opted not to be part of the collective labour agreement for banking institutions
in the Netherlands. Therefore, the Council – as the representative of all NIBC’s employees on the
payroll in the Netherlands – became senior management’s direct interlocutor for negotiations in this
important area. The negotiations have led to revisions in our employee benefit scheme in 2018.
The Council advised on three matters in 2018: the IPO, organisational adjustments to the Corporate
Banking and Operations departments. The Council approved two matters, including adjustments to
the Staff Manual and to the policy on private investment transactions. Furthermore, the Council used
its right to nominate a member of the Supervisory Board.
Given the challenges facing NIBC and the banking sector, the Council remains focused on the
employability of NIBC’s staff and on NIBC’s competitive position as an attractive employer. This was
reflected in the Council’s position with respect to reorganisations, diversity and labour agreements.
The Council actively monitors employee engagement and other metrics (e.g. absence ratios) in order
to gauge the effect of increasing workload. This may be caused by competitive pressure, the effect of
reorganisations and increased activity levels of NIBC in 2018. The Council has also been actively
involved with multiple other developments such as the sustainable investment policy of the NIBC
pension fund, mobility policies and employability while also maintaining regular contact with the
Works Councils of other Dutch banks and financial institutions in order to learn from best practices.

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
SUSTAINABILITY
At NIBC, we believe it is our responsibility to be a sustainable business for the benefit of future
generations. We are convinced that as a business that takes its social and environmental
responsibilities seriously, we are better able to manage our risks. Sustainability and innovation are
themes which will lead to promising opportunities in our markets.
We want to ensure that the services we provide are responsible and sustainable. Additionally, as a
financial services provider, we are well aware of the enormous responsibility we have in helping to
build and maintain trust in our industry.
Our day-to-day business decisions and interactions with clients are guided by established principles
and policies set out in our Code of Conduct, Business Principles, Corporate Values, Compliance
Framework and Sustainability Framework. You can find these documents on our website. For many
years, we have steadily developed our sustainability agenda in close consultation with our
stakeholders.
Core standards
We manage the sustainability impact of our financings through our Sustainability Framework, which
can be found in the Sustainability section on our website. Our Sustainability Framework describes
governance, implementation and the roles and responsibilities within our organisation in regard to
sustainability risks. NIBC defines sustainability risks to include environmental, climate, social, human
rights and governance risks.
The framework and its policies are based on internationally recognised conventions, standards and
best practices. Our approach to certain sectors and activities is further elaborated in our sustainability
sector policies. These standards provide the overarching principles and standards that form the basis
for NIBC to consider its engagement with clients.
As part of our standard process we reviewed all of our sustainability policies, updating where
necessary to reflect improvements, best practices and societal developments which are relevant for
our financial activities and operations.
Sustainability ratings
During 2018, NIBC received upgrades of its sustainability ratings from ISS-Oekom (to Prime/C+) and
Sustainalytics (to 72 / Outperfomer). RepRisk continued to rate NIBC at top levels – AA for NIBC
Holding and AAA for NIBC Bank. MSCI reaffirmed NIBC at its AA rating. These ratings place NIBC
among the top financial institutions in terms of sustainability. This is due to our comprehensive
sustainability policies, effective environmental and human rights due diligence, and increased
transparency in our sustainability reporting. We aspire to maintain a high level of sustainability and to
continuously improve in the years ahead. Reviews of our policies and performance by leading
sustainability research and rating agencies will continue to help us toward this goal.
Sustainable development goals
Based on our business activities and where we believe that we can have the most impact, NIBC has
prioritised several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of our sustainability strategy. These
SDGs include Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12), Economic Growth (SDG8),
Industry & Innovation (SDG9), Sustainable Communities (SDG11), and Clean Energy (SDG7).
Importantly, these goals relate closely to our corporate and retail businesses and business strategy. By
focusing on these SDGs, we believe we will also contribute towards several other goals including
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 69
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Good Health (SDG3), Gender Equality (SDG5) and Climate Action (SDG13) among others.
References to the SDGs are included in our Sustainability Report, UN Global Compact Commitment
on Progress and other reports on our corporate website.
Equator Principles
NIBC is one of 94 financial institutions in 37 countries worldwide which have officially adopted the
Equator Principles (EPs). The EPs are a risk management framework for determining, assessing and
managing environmental and human rights risks in project finance transactions. NIBC has
implemented the EPs in our sustainability policies and due diligence process for financing projects.
Consequently, NIBC will not provide project finance or project-related corporate loans to projects
where the client will not, or is unable to, comply with the EPs. In 2018, five transactions financed by
NIBC were closed which qualified under these guidelines. Each of these transactions were in north-
west Europe.
How we manage sustainability
Our governance revolves around a system of checks and balances which ensures stakeholder views
are taken into account in our decision-making processes. NIBC's Managing Board is ultimately
responsible for all sustainability matters. ExCo members discuss and advise on sustainability strategy,
targets, planning and budget. The ExCo is also responsible for policies that impact NIBC’s culture and
ethics, such as the Code of Conduct. Any significant updates to the sustainability framework and
underlying policies are reviewed and approved by NIBC’s Risk Management Committee.
Responsibility for overseeing NIBC's sustainability agenda is delegated to the Sustainability Officer but
is primarily managed by and embedded in each business unit. Processes, roles and responsibilities are
defined to manage sustainability and take a precautionary approach.
Sustainability Officer
The NIBC Sustainability agenda is led by a dedicated full-time senior sustainability officer who is
responsible for catalysing sustainability and corporate social responsibility within the organisation.
The officer is responsible for the set-up and implementation of the sustainability strategy, including
targets, planning and budget. He is up to date on all sustainability developments and is responsible for
engaging with our external stakeholders. The officer meets regularly with each business unit to
discuss progress and evaluate activities. Sustainability matters are monitored and reported periodically
to the ExCo and the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC), a subcommittee of NIBC's
Supervisory Board.
Business units
NIBC’s Sustainability agenda is aligned with our business strategy, and different departments are
responsible for managing sustainability as part of their activities. For example, business teams apply
the Sustainability Framework in their client interactions, Facilities & Services manages NIBC’s energy
efficiency programme, and Human Resources is responsible for sustainability in our human resource
activities.
We ensure sustainability due diligence is performed on all corporate clients and transactions. New
products and significant changes to existing products are assessed for potential human rights and
environmental impacts. Subsidiaries of NIBC have adapted our compliance policies and sustainability
policies to their businesses and applied these in their operations and client interactions. Suppliers are
required to meet our human rights, environment and anti-corruption standards and are evaluated as
part of NIBC’s know your supplier (KYS) process.
70 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
Non-financial reporting
The NIBC Annual Report 2018 has been drafted in accordance with the Dutch Decree disclosure on
non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiele informatie), which came into effect on
24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-Financial Reporting
Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330).
This report has also been prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards:
core option. Our GRI Content Index and a materiality assessment can be found on the NIBC Annual
Report website. Sustainability performance indicators such as NIBC’s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are
reported in detail in our Sustainability Report including comparable figures from prior years.
Additional non-financial information and disclosures are published in the Sustainability section of our
website.
Environmental sustainability and natural capital
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity are signs of unprecedented pressure on the
environment and the planet’s ecological limits. NIBC is committed to preserving natural capital by
reducing negative impacts on biodiversity and the environment by facilitating the transition towards
more responsible business practices.
NIBC is carbon neutral in regard to direct emissions from its own operations. Since 2010, we have
measured our direct emissions, realised substantial reductions and compensated for any remaining
direct emissions. During 2018, NIBC extended its certified gold standard carbon offset programme
with Climate Neutral Group through 2020. The offsets support emission reductions in Africa, ensure
clean water for these local communities, promote gender equality and social development of women.
We manage our direct impact on the environment through an environmental management
programme. 100% of electricity used in NIBC's facilities is sourced from renewable energy. In 2018,
further renovations were initiated at our headquarters in The Hague. These were based in part on
an energy audit that was conducted at the end of 2017. These improvements will help to further
optimise energy efficiency and contribute to energy-related carbon emission reductions directly
related to our operations. Our geothermal system in the Hague was also optimised to reduce use of
gas heating and cooling, thereby reducing future emissions.
NIBC also supports its clients in their transition towards more sustainable business. The main
environmental risks in NIBC’s financings are climate risk and water security as a result of rising global
temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. During 2018, no severe environmental incidents
related to NIBC’s financings, own operations or supply chain were reported.
We mitigate potential environmental and biodiversity risks through client and transaction due
diligence, stakeholder engagement and by supporting companies in their transition toward more
responsible business. For example, NIBC’s Commercial Real Estate team is supporting entrepreneurial
companies which develop near 'energy neutral' buildings (Bijna Energie Neutral Gebouw, 'BENG'),
pushing further innovation in building efficiency. This approach also contributes to national and
European objectives to increase building resource efficiency in line with commitments under the Paris
Climate Agreement.
Responsible ship recycling standards
NIBC is one of three founding members of the responsible ship recycling standards (RSRS), an
initiative that aims to promote more responsible practices in the shipping industry, particularly
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 71
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
regarding environmental and human rights impacts. The RSRS promote the use of inventories for
hazardous materials and ensure responsible ship recycling at end of life.
Importantly, NIBC’s shipping clients embraced this approach and have led its implementation. A
number of clients have taken further steps beyond the vessels financed by NIBC and have committed
to this approach across their entire fleet. Additional leading shipping financiers have joined RSRS
during 2018. NIBC met with representatives of ship owners, trade unions, NGOs, peer banks and
national authorities to address the adverse human rights and environmental effects within the sector's
global value chain and to work together to influence improved standards and practices.
NIBC also acted in a coordinating role for a selective number of Dutch Banks in the drafting of a
'Green Deal' with national authorities, ship owners and other stakeholders in the Dutch maritime
industry. The Green Deal for Shipping, Inland Shipping and Ports is part of a National Climate
Agreement to reduce emissions towards 2030.
Social sustainability and human capital
NIBC believes that respect for human rights is a basic responsibility; towards our own employees, but
also towards those people who are affected directly or indirectly by our actions. NIBC endorses
human rights as formulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (‘Ruggie framework’) and
UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
Respecting people and their human rights is a foundation of NIBC’s Code of Conduct which
underpins NIBC's corporate values. Human rights due diligence is integrated into our sustainability
due diligence and monitoring processes for financings, investments, and product development to
identify, mitigate and manage potential human rights risks. NIBC has published an overview aligned
with the UNGP Reporting Framework in our Sustainability Report.
During 2018 no severe human rights incidents related to NIBC’s financings, own operations, and
supply chain were reported. The main salient human rights risks for NIBC are labour conditions and
worker safety in corporate client supply chains. NIBC manages these risks through stakeholder
engagement, client and transaction due diligence and by raising awareness with corporate clients. Full
transparency into supply chains is an ongoing challenge for mid-market corporate businesses but is
gradually improving.
IRBC agreement for the Dutch banking sector
NIBC signed the International Responsible Business Conduct (IRBC) agreement for the Dutch
banking sector. The initiative aims to improve human rights practices related to project and corporate
financings and is guided by the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises and UN Guiding
Principles for Business and Human Rights. We use the IRBC platform to share knowledge and engage
with civil society organisations, authorities, clients, and financial sector peers. During 2018, NIBC
actively participated in working groups focused on knowledge sharing and enabling effective grievance
and remedy mechanisms.
Tax compliance
NIBC proactively communicates with tax authorities, evidenced by its ongoing agreement on
horizontal supervision with the Dutch tax authorities. NIBC has an administrative organisation,
procedures and internal controls, to meet our tax compliance requirements. We consider tax risk in
our decision making with regard to clients, transactions and investments. Our aim is to avoid possible
risks of tax base erosion and profit-shifting activities.
72 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
NIBC’s Tax Position Statement on our corporate website summarises our approach. Our Statement
is reviewed periodically in order to keep it up to date and in line with all relevant developments in
rules and regulations, changes within the organisation and societal demands. We do not engage in
transactions without economic substance or which are exclusively aimed at safekeeping or realising
tax benefits for ourselves or our clients.
Stakeholder engagement
We recognise our responsibilities towards stakeholders, and look to consider their interests in our
day-to-day decisions and activities. Engaging with stakeholders in a proactive way and on a continuous
basis is central to our strategy and ambition to achieve sustainable growth. To ensure our long-term
success, we acknowledge the need to strike a careful balance between the interests of all our
stakeholders.
We define stakeholders as any group or individual affected directly or indirectly by our activities. We
have identified our main stakeholders to include clients, investors and shareholders, regulators, rating
agencies, employees and society at large. Our engagement with these groups takes place via different
channels that range from ongoing dialogue to direct requests for feedback.
Management and materiality
We engage with stakeholders to capture their views through a regular materiality assessment process.
Stakeholder representatives are interviewed to determine the aspects that have a direct or indirect
impact on economic, social or environmental value and to determine which are most important to
their stakeholder group. The analysis was conducted in preparation of this report and the results are
compiled and reported visually in this chapter.
As part of this process, we also evaluate NIBC’s value chain, assessing the different areas of the value
we create and the capital we control. This is done not only in terms of our products and services to
our clients, but also in terms of the value we deliver to those who invest in us and provide funding.
We have encapsulated the results into a ‘value flow’ diagram which provides clarity into our value
creation model. While a simplified view, it reflects our client-first business agenda and our business
principles which will enable our future financial and non-financial performance.

Materiality analysis 2018
For 2018, our stakeholder consultation was performed across a range of stakeholder groups
representing our clients, investors, regulators, civil society and employees. One significant change from
recent years was a result of NIBC’s Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2018. This has added new equity
shareholder voices among the diverse stakeholders with whom we engage. Stakeholder
representatives were asked to rank each material topic on a scale of 1 to10 (1 = least important; 10
= most important).
We used this opportunity to ask for more specific feedback in regard to diverse issues such as
climate risk, ethics, diversity, data privacy and others. They were also invited to add material topics of
their own. The location of each topic within the graph represents the result of their response.
74 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
The three most important aspects for stakeholders were client satisfaction, product responsibility and
transparency. Client satisfaction was seen by stakeholders as the most material aspect. They believe
that high client satisfaction is an indicator of the strength of our franchise.
Product responsibility and agility are also very important and areas of strength for NIBC. Our online
platform and clear terms and conditions in retail banking were appreciated by clients. Stakeholders
appreciated the agility and sector expertise in NIBC's corporate offering.
Information security and privacy significantly increased in importance to stakeholders, likely due to
increased public awareness of data protection regulations such as GDPR. Stakeholder views on
financial performance reflected the balance that many are increasingly expecting in regard to financial
and non-financial aspects.
Stakeholders have appreciated NIBC's focus and efforts to take action on diversity broadly and
gender equality more specifically. Having a diversity committee to oversee progress within the
company, focus on improving gender equality, and improved diversity in senior management and in
our Supervisory Board is seen as tangible and meaningful. This positive feedback throughout 2018
inspires and motivates NIBC staff to continue to make further progress.
NIBC NGO Boulevard
In 2015, we launched the NIBC NGO Boulevard, a unique initiative that makes modern office space
and professional facilities available to good causes. Civil society organisations in the NIBC NGO
Boulevard include Maatschappelijke Alliantie, Missing Chapter, Stichting Vitalis, SDG Charter and
Buddy Network. One focus area for all of these organisations and NIBC has been to contribute to
Dutch efforts towards the SDGs through activities and initiatives. Our daily interactions, joint
initiatives and workshops, and other activities have significantly increased awareness at NIBC staff of
human rights and environmental risks and impacts.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 75
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
NIBC aims to help these civil society organisations to be effective and increase their impact. At the
same time, since we share the same facilities, these organisations inspire us and help raise the
awareness amongst NIBC's employees of societal challenges. Interaction with these civil society
organisations has led to several joint initiatives on societal challenges focused on financial education,
circular economy, and mobility as part of NIBC's Talent Programme. New initiatives are planned for
2019.
Community engagement
NIBC wants to be a good corporate citizen by contributing to the well-being of the societies in which
we operate. We encourage our employees to volunteer their time and expertise to community
projects, and support their initiatives by matching the money they raise for good causes. In addition,
NIBC runs its own social projects, some of which are focused on helping to educate youngsters
about prudent money management.
NIBC employees were active in a wide range of initiatives in our communities during 2018. In March,
NIBC employees again conducted financial education classes during the Week van het Geld (Global
Money Week), an initiative whereby bankers provide fun lessons about money to primary school
children. Approximately 700 primary school children participated in this Bank voor de Klas
programme with NIBC staff.
NIBC donated food and dozens of our employees packed 2,200 holiday food parcels to support
families which rely on the Dutch Foodbanks. Together with employees of other leading corporates
such as Unilever, Mars, Shell, Dr Oetker and Upfield we ensured that each of the 35,000 families
reliant on the Foodbanks received a holiday food parcel.
Beequip continued their support of 'Honey Highway', an initiative which sows flowers to create
habitat for bees and combat bee mortality. NIBC was a main sponsor of the Union International Club
in Frankfurt for the second time, catalysing a donation to the Frankfurt Clementine Children's
Hospital and increasing awareness in the Rhine Main Business Region.
In December, employees in The Hague supported Stichting Vitalis in what has become an annual
holiday tradition at the bank. Vitalis is a professional non-profit organisation that supports vulnerable
children so they can avoid intensive professional youth counselling programmes. NIBC employees
provided personalised holiday gifts for more than 100 children in a special Christmas event.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In the following table, we measure NIBC’s performance against the strategic priorities as described in
the 2017 annual report.
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES PERFORMANCE
Continuous evolution of our client franchise, Current NPS is +63% (2017: +64%), while our
expertise and proposition customer satisfaction survey result for NIBC Direct is
7.7 (2017: 7.9). Both are above target.
In both Retail and Corporate client offering, the OTM
proposition has been further developed, leading to a
significant increase of assets under management, (Retail:
+231% to EUR 2.4 billion; Corporate: +86% to
EUR 0.9 billion).
In 2018, the Nordics has been added as a target
geographic market and the first transactions have been
executed.
Focus on growth of asset portfolio in core NIBC has started to rebalance the Corporate portfolio
markets in 2018, to focus on profitable niches and (sub)sectors.
This has led to a reduction of EUR 223 million (14%) of
Leverage Finance exposures and simultaneously to an
increase of EUR 147 million (52%) in lease receivables
and EUR 196 million (24%) in receivables financing.
Diversification of income In 2018, we have continued to focus on growing our
OTM revenues, leading to EUR 11 million OTM-related
fee income, an increase of 175%.
Building on existing agile and effective Further developing our capital markets franchise,
organisation growing the portfolios of recently added niches and
meeting new reporting requirements have challenged
the organisation. With the talent present, NIBC has
been successful in addressing these challenges.
Ongoing investment in people, culture and EUR 3,100 per employee spent on training and
innovation educational programmes (2017: EUR 2,300).
Employee Experience Survey was completed using a
new methodology. Scores provide useful insights to
improve our employee engagement, commitment and
overall satisfaction as well as our employership.
Further optimisation of capital structure and With the full adoption of IFRS 9, the CET 1 ratio
diversification of funding reduced to 16.1% per 1 January 2018. Due to the
strong result and reduction of RWAs, the CET 1 ratio
increased to 18.5% per year-end 2018. During the year,
NIBC has been able to use a variety of funding
instruments, including a new RMBS transaction ensuring
continued access to the various parts of the capital
market.
EUR 250 million GBP was issued in order to improve
our funding match to the corporate exposures.

Recent developments
NIBC operates in an environment that is characterised by continuous change. This section highlights
several developments and the relevance for NIBC's operations.
Corporate client offering
We operate in a world in which change is ever faster, impacted by continuous and accelerating
developments in the areas of technological advancements, innovation, platformisation, the energy

REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
transformation, sustainability, consumer empowerment and ageing. In order to facilitate the continued
growth dialogue with our clients, we have formulated a focused strategy and revised our commercial
business model for Corporate Banking. The corporate bank will be organised along a number of
product-market combinations, focused on origination, execution & portfolio management of their
core products, based on specific client needs. We aim to further rebalance activities and exposures,
whilst becoming more active in high growth areas acting as a growth enabler for our clients. Income
diversification. and a strong focus on productivity will be drivers of future growth.
In 2019, this refined strategy, focused on sustainability and technological innovation, and organisational
structure will be implemented in order to enable our people to be the best professionals they can
be.
Regulatory environment
Following several incidents in the financial sector, the attention for non-financial risk management has
increased. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations are two pivotal
areas for the financial sector, as banks fullfill an important role as gatekeeper. As a response to the
incidents, regulators have increased oversight intensity on these matters. On-site inspections and
desktop reviews are done in order to evaluate the quality of the policies and execution of those
policies.
NIBC acknowledges the importance of knowing its clients and consequently the necessity to fully
comply with the associated laws and regulations. In July 2018, the European Fourth Anti-Money
Laundering Directive 2018 came into effect. During the second half of 2018, DNB executed an on-
site inspection focusing on how NIBC incorporates systemic integrity risk analysis (SIRA). Both the
new Directive and the observations from the on-site inspection have already led to improvements of
our policy framework and procedures to increase effectiveness of controls. During 2019, NIBC will
continue to implement improvements in its processes related to client due diligence.
Brexit
With a branch office located in London and various activities carried out in the UK on a cross-border
basis from the Netherlands and Germany, NIBC is exposed to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. To
the extent NIBC carries out regulated activities in (and into) the UK, it does so on the basis of its
Dutch and/or German licenses, as passported to the UK. Depending on the outcome of the UK/EU
political negotiations, NIBC may be required to apply for a local license in due course and, in the
meantime, to enter into the Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR) as implemented by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA, the UK regulator). The TPR (and its equivalent as implemented by the
Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK) will enable financial institutions to continue operating
in the UK – post a hard Brexit – essentially on the same basis as before, under the supervision of the
FCA and/or the PRA. To ensure continued access to the UK market we are in the process of
completing our entry into the TPR and are in close dialogue with the FCA and the DNB in relation
to such matters. In addition, certain contractual arrangements such as ISDA agreements with UK
financial institutions and trade reporting arrangements have been reviewed and (are being) amended
and/or replaced, where necessary to ensure continuity. Furthermore, NIBC has invited its clients to
enter into a dialogue on the effects of Brexit on their business and operations.
Brexit may negatively impact the macro economic climate in Europe. The impact that this may have
on our clients and consequently on NIBC's positions remains difficult to assess.
80 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE MANAGING BOARD
IT Transition
In 2016, NIBC explored a new framework for IT delivery, including outsourcing a substantial part of
its IT infrastructure to a third party. The chosen outsourcing initiative was cancelled at the end of
2017 and the relevant contract terminated. In December 2017, we started to work on the
retransition of the relevant IT infrastructure back to NIBC. This retransition was successfully
completed in the second quarter of 2018. At the same time, new opportunities to achieve the
intended goals were evaluated. This led to the signing of a contract with Cegeka as the new
outsourcing service provider in June 2018. As part of the agreement, a full transition of the relevant
IT infrastructure towards Cegeka is scheduled in the third quarter of 2019.
As a financial institution, NIBC is highly dependent on its IT systems and IT infrastructure for the
continuity of the operations. NIBC continuously strives to further improve its IT environment and
systems. In 2018, serious investments were made. The outsourcing of our IT infrastructure should
over time result in a more efficient and effective organisation for running the bank and to fast track
the change agenda of NIBC.
The necessary retransition, early 2018, of the IT infrastructure resulted in delay in the continuous
improvement efforts relating amongst others to logical access management and the further
strengthening of the governance around outsourced systems and applications. Consequently, NIBC
has taken actions to remediate these topics. In addition, a project is started to simplify and strengthen
the relevant processes. Despite the challenges related to these developments, NIBC remained in
control of its IT operations, which serviced NIBC's business on a stable basis.
The earlier reported legal proceedings with the previous IT outsourcing service provider have been
terminated by a settlement on mutual satisfactory terms. NIBC does not disclose detailed information
regarding such provisions and/or settlements as such disclosures could seriously prejudice its position
and/or disclosures are not allowed based on the settlement agreements. This settlement has no
material impact on the financial performance of NIBC.
Long-term value creation
With its purpose and strategic priorities in mind, NIBC is continuously evaluating its position within
the financial ecosystem and calibrating its short-term action plans with its long-term strategy. With
the direct interaction between the Managing Board and the Executive Committee, NIBC ensures the
connection between its strategy planning process and stakeholder engagement processes, so that the
interests of different stakeholders are actively included in the decision-making process. The choices
are translated into a long-term capital planning, which is on the agenda of the Audit Committee. In
the current environment, these processes have led to amongst others a focus on actively rebalancing
our portfolios, the development of our OTM proposition, investments in CDD processes and
procedures and various reporting processes and the on-going transition of NIBC’s IT infrastructure to
an external outsourcing service provider.
With this approach, NIBC is actively steering on long-term value creation, to the benefit of all
stakeholders.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY
BOARD
The Supervisory Board is proud to present that 2018 was again a very strong year for NIBC in many
respects. We saw strong results in profit, product portfolio and client franchise in both retail and
corporate client offering. In the first months of 2018 the agenda of the Supervisory Board was fully
focused on the listing of NIBC Holding N.V. at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange as of 23 March 2018.
This listing marks a new point in the history of the company and has raised its public profile.
NIBC delivered a very strong performance in 2018. It did so by continuing its strategy of a focused
approach to select market niches in the dynamic mid-sized segment. Hereby NIBC further
strengthened its franchise and expanded its offering to clients. NIBC's profit after tax attributable to
shareholders amounted, for the second year in a row, to more than EUR 200 million, as it increased
from EUR 213 million in 2017 to EUR 217 million in 2018 (+2%). Excluding non-recurring items the
profit improved from EUR 160 million to EUR 173 million, or by more than 8%.
Our most important stakeholder, the customer, continues to value our efforts to serve his or her
interests demonstrated by our sustainable strong client satisfaction scores: our NPS for corporate
clients was +63% in 2018 (2017: +64%) and our NIBC Direct Customer Survey 7.7 (2017: 7.9). The
success of a mid-sized niche market bank and retail offering like NIBC stands or falls with an excellent
customer experience, therefore the Supervisory Board pays close attention to these metrics.
The Supervisory Board notes with satisfaction that NIBC proves it has the agility to continuously
reinvent itself. This theme was also shared by the Managing Board as the driver for the rebalancing of
the portfolios in the corporate client segment and the strong growth of the originate-to-manage
mortgages in the retail offering.
Corporate client offering
In 2018, corporate client offering achieved solid results in almost all products and (sub)sectors. Initially
a lending house for mostly medium-sized family businesses, NIBC corporate client offering has
transformed into a broad range, mid-market bank that is equipped to deliver on the entire liability
side of the client's balance sheet. NIBC corporate client offering primarily achieves this by leveraging
its expertise in key (sub)sectors where it can add the greatest value through its tailored solutions and
services. NIBC corporate client offering continued its gradual shift in client groups, with a strong focus
on building more granular portfolios e.g. in receivable finance and leasing. It focuses on mid-sized and
often family-owned companies in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Due to the growing
product range it increasingly attracts other highly relevant client groups: private equity funds and
parties, institutional investors, financial sponsors and large corporate clients. The origination and
refinancing volumes increased from EUR 3.1 billion in 2017 to EUR 3.7 billion in 2018, an all time
high.
Retail client offering
In 2018, total mortgage origination volume increased to EUR 3.4 billion in 2018 ( 2017:
EUR 2 billion), of which EUR 1.8 billion for originate-to-manage. These mortgage loans are originated
for our strategic partner AXA Investment Managers. We were able to increase the mandate with
AXA Investment Managers to EUR 3.5 billion. Consequently, retail client offering is creating a new fee
revenue stream. Total mortgage loans for own book increased by more than 5% to EUR 9.3 billion.
As NIBC Direct celebrated its 10th anniversary for its saving products in 2018, they visited several
current clients who were also our launching customers, to celebrate this event together.
82 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Medium-term targets and dividend
The Supervisory Board is proud that NIBC delivered upon its promises to meet the medium-term
targets as set early 2018. We realise that good economic conditions in our home markets supported
NIBC in this period, but the Board strongly believes that NIBC’s delivery upon its clear strategy was
key to this success. The strong performance over 2018 is also demonstrated by the proposed total
dividend of EUR 229 million.
Executive Committee
In 2018, the Executive Committee (ExCo) comprised of the three Managing Board members together
with Saskia Hovers (Corporate clients sectors), Michel Kant (Retail clients) and Caroline Oosterbaan
(Corporate clients products).
The members of the Managing Board attended all meetings of the Supervisory Board. The non-
statutory members of the Executive Committee attended almost all meetings of the Supervisory
Board (illness or permanent education were the only reasons for absence). Through these meetings,
in addition to the regular informal contacts, the Supervisory Board stays closely tuned with all
developments throughout the focus areas of the individual ExCo members.
As part of the annual evaluation of the Managing Board/ExCo, the interaction and communication
between the statutory and non-statutory members of the ExCo was observed as an attention point.
Additional effort will be put in communication to close the perceived gap in this area.
Composition of the Supervisory Board
Throughout the year, NIBC’s Supervisory Board has performed its duties towards the company’s
stakeholders, and had full access to all necessary information and company officers and staff
members. We would like to extend our gratitude to all relevant stakeholders for providing us this
information.
As per 31 December 2018 the Supervisory Board comprised of two female and five male members
of various nationalities. Four members are independent members that meet the independence
criteria laid out in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The other three are representatives of
NIBC Holding's majority shareholder.

REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Changes in 2018
In 2018, new members Ms A.G.Z. Kemna (Angelien) and Ms S.M. Zijderveld (Susi) were appointed
to the NIBC Supervisory Board. They both started as per 27 Augustus after appointment in the
Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. Ms Kemna became member of the Risk Policy &
Compliance Committee (RPCC) in August and chair of the RPCC in December thereby succeeding
Mr de Jong who stepped down in December at the end of his term after being a member of NIBC’s
Supervisory Board for 13 years. Ms Zijderveld became chair of the Remuneration and Nominating
Committee, succeeding Mr Veenhof who stepped down in March at the end of his term after being a
member of NIBC’s Supervisory Board for 12 years. In the time between the resignation of Mr
Veenhof and the appointment of Ms Zijderveld, Mr van den Goorbergh acted as chair of the RNC. In
August 2018, Ms Steel stepped down at the end of her term after being a member of NIBC’s
Supervisory Board for 4 years. The Supervisory Board wishes to express its gratitude to Mr de Jong,
Mr Veenhof and Ms Steel for their great and continuous input and efforts during the years they
served the company.
Because 2018 was a year of strategical importance, stability was key for NIBC’s Supervisory Board. In
January 2018, for this reason, Supervisory Board’s chair Mr van den Goorbergh was reappointed for a
maximum of one year till the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of 2019.
Diversity and succession
In November 2018, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee of the Supervisory Board
discussed a succession planning for the (near) future. The Supervisory Board is pleased with its
current composition and that of its Committees, as changes always bring new perspectives and the
changes in 2018 contributed to further diversity in terms of gender, age and skills. In the case of a
vacancy, the regular policy is applied in which an executive search firm is asked to provide a shortlist
with at least 50% female candidates, although final selection is ultimately based on the suitability for a
specific position.
With the scheduled resignation of Mr van den Goorbergh as per the AGM of 2019, the Supervisory
Board will need at least one new member in 2019. With the support of an executive search firm we
have started a new search.
Additional functions
All members of the Supervisory Board meet the criteria of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
relating to other positions, insofar as they are relevant to the performance of the Supervisory Board
member’s duties.
Since the Dutch Act on Management and Supervision came into force on 1 January 2013, we have
been monitoring the number of supervisory functions held by our Supervisory Board members. The
profile for the Supervisory Board and their relevant ancillary positions can be found at the end of this
chapter and on our website. 
Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board met on seven occasions in 2018. This included three regular two-day
meetings in February, August and November and two regular one-day meetings in June and
December. An additional one-day meeting in June was held at which the Supervisory Board and the
Executive Committee discussed NIBC’s current and future strategy, and the way the company can
meet its objectives in order to provide long term value creation for all stakeholders. Due to the IPO
process and the publication of NIBC’s annual results already beginning of February an additional
meeting was held early February. Most members of the Supervisory Board participated in all
84 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
meetings in 2018; three members were absent from one meeting and one member was absent from
two meetings.
The members of the Managing Board attended all meetings of the Supervisory Board. The non-
statutory members of the Executive Committee attended almost all meetings of the Supervisory
Board (illness or permanent education were the only reasons for absence). Additionally, three
members of the Supervisory Board attended two consultation meetings between the Chief Executive
Officer and the Works Council.
In the first months of 2018, several meetings were held to discuss the progress on the IPO and
challenges encountered. After the IPO in March 2018, the Supervisory Board focused more on
different (strategic) topics such as reporting as a publicly listed company, strategic initiatives, the
Corporate and Retail client offering, risk management, the IT Forward/Move project, the funding
profile, remuneration and the regulatory environment and reporting. The 2018 quarterly and interim
results were discussed as well as the proposed dividend payout and the budget for 2019.
The Supervisory Board also continued its permanent education (PE) programme. During one of the
PE sessions the IPO process and the role and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board in this process
were extensively discussed. In other PE sessions the impact of IFRS9 and Cyber Security were the
topics.
There were no transactions in the year in which the members of the Supervisory Board had a
conflict of interest. One member of the Supervisory Board and the spouse of one member of the
Supervisory Board acquired shares in NIBC Holding N.V. shortly after the IPO. Please refer to note
53 to the Financial Statements for more detail.
The financial statements and the findings of the external auditor were discussed in the external
auditor’s presence.
The four Supervisory Board committees
Most of the discussions and decisions of the Supervisory Board were prepared in the four
committees referred to below. The committees of the Supervisory Board each have an independent
chair.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee (AC) assists the Supervisory Board in monitoring NIBC’s systems of financial
risk management and internal control, the integrity of its financial reporting process and the content
of its annual and semi-annual financial statements and reports. The Audit Committee also advises on
corporate governance and internal governance.
The AC met on four occasions in 2018 (March, June, August and November) in presence of the
Managing Board. An additional meeting was held in January 2019 to discuss the Management Letter
2018. One member of the AC was absent during one meeting. By mutual agreement the external
auditor was represented at all meetings of the AC in 2018. The external auditor had one meeting
with the AC without the members of the Managing Board being present.
The chairman of the AC prepared the meetings in advance by having meetings and calls with NIBC’s
CFO, the head of Finance and the head of Internal Audit. In between meetings, NIBC also actively
shared relevant information with the chairman.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 85
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
In 2018, the AC extensively reviewed NIBC’s quarterly financial highlights, interim and annual financial
reports and related press releases. It discussed the draft reports of the external auditor, including its
Audit Results Report, before the reports were discussed in the Supervisory Board meeting.
The AC had in depth discussions about NIBC’s financial performance, including the development of
the bank’s net profit, business growth and the development of spreads and cost/income ratios.
Furthermore, the AC reviewed NIBC’s liquidity and its funding profile, and the development of
related liquidity and solvency ratios. The AC was informed specifically on the retransition of the IT
infrastructure and the related risks as well as the decision to outsource to a new third party. Also the
progress made in the retransition was discussed in detail.
Specific topics discussed with the auditor dealt with loan loss provisioning, especially in light of the
adoption of IFRS 9 and the associated staging of expected credit losses. Furthermore the sale of
legacy portfolios, NIBC’s change agenda, new developments and their impact on financial figures and
fraud risk were discussed. The impact of IFRS 9 and the IT transition (IT Forward/Move) were the
two topics that were discussed during all AC meetings. The Management Letter 2018 was discussed
in an additional meeting in January 2019. Main topics in the Management Letter are the IT
environment including the transition to a new external provider, the current state of the IT-landscape
with respect to access management and the internal control environment and governance on
outsourcing arrangements, loan loss provisioning with a focus on the impairment triggers in the
process. Also compliance was included where anti-money laundering and customer due diligence are
the main areas.
Next to the regular topics mentioned before, the AC also discussed and has taken notice of
management views and arguments on the deferred tax position, Basel IV impact on the capital
position, budget 2019, forecast and capital plan 2018-2021, dividend policy and main topics discussed
in the Disclosure Committee. The external auditor also reported on its independence towards the
AC which was further discussed by the AC. The AC annually assesses NIBC’s compliance with the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code and reports thereon towards the Supervisory Board.
The AC took note of and discussed NIBC’s consultations with DNB. As part of the yearly cycle, the
AC discussed the main observations made by DNB in its annual SREP letter and the impact on the
business/capital positions of the bank. The AC considered the on-site examinations conducted by
DNB, including examinations of IRRBB (Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book) and an onsite on SIRA
(Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis).
The AC discussed the annual plan and quarterly reports of Internal Audit, and evaluated the
functioning of Internal Audit. Both the internal and external auditor reported on the quality and
effectiveness of governance, internal control and risk management.
Risk Policy & Compliance Committee
The Risk Policy & Compliance Committee (RPCC) assists the Supervisory Board in supervising NIBC’s
risk appetite, risk profile and risk policy. It prepares matters in these areas for decision in the
Supervisory Board by presenting proposals and recommendations on credit, market, investment,
liquidity, operational and compliance/regulatory risks, and any other material (non) financial risks to
which NIBC is exposed. The RPCC met four times in 2018 in the presence of the members of the
Managing Board.
During 2018, the RPCC extensively discussed NIBC’s assets, liquidity and funding, stress tests and risk
profile. A topic that was on the agenda throughout 2018 was NIBC’s risk appetite framework and
86 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
the forward looking nature thereof. The RPCC discussed NIBC’s long-term objectives, including the
attainment and retention of a BBB+ credit rating, appraised developments in the six defined pillars of
risk appetite (franchise, solvency, profitability, liquidity, funding and asset quality). Updates to the risk
appetite framework, involving new metrics and revised limits, were reviewed and approved.
The RPCC was also involved in the process leading towards NIBC’s successful initial public offering in
March 2018, identifying new risks and appraising their impact on the organisation.
On the overall compliance and regulatory topics, the RPCC extensively discussed the profile of the
bank and its customers, associated regulatory requirements and the ways that NIBC controls the
potential risks involved.
Besides risk appetite and the quarterly reporting on the subject received by the committee, the
RPCC discussed in all of its meetings segments of NIBC’s corporate and retail credit portfolios,
including appropriate risk measurement parameters for portfolio performance, the bank’s distressed
portfolio, as well as specific distressed exposures.
Other topics the RPCC regularly reviewed included NIBC’s market risk reports, liquidity risk reports
and risks of the macroeconomic environment, such as the availability of foreign currency funding and
the impact of Brexit.
On the non-financial risk side, the RPCC reviewed NIBC’s franchise as reflected in the experience of
its customers, the relation with the regulators, the views of the rating agencies and its operational risk
profile and in-control environment, including specific risks such as information security, new product
approvals and significant changes within the organisation, as well as compliance and regulatory risk.
The committee also reviewed the risk assessments of new business initiatives, evaluated how risk
awareness is embedded in NIBC’s organisation, as well as its own functioning. In addition, it regularly
reviewed and discussed regulatory, societal and market developments and their impact on NIBC,
such as systematic integrity risk analysis, Basel IV, sustainability, block chain, Euribor residential
mortgage loans and interbank benchmarks.
The RPCC paid attention to the ongoing examinations at financial institutions in general concerning
systemic integrity risks as well as the SIRA on-site by DNB at NIBC in 2018. In the RPCC the follow-
up by NIBC on the SIRA on-site and the improvements in processes related to client due diligence
and relevant controls were discussed. The increased management attention ensuring adherence to
KYC principles and the onboarding process is appreciated and stimulated by the RPCC. The RPCC is
also actively discussing the implementation of relevant laws and regulations, including the European
Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive 2018, by NIBC.
Remuneration and Nominating Committee
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee (RNC) advises the Supervisory Board on the
remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the Managing Board and certain other
senior managers. In addition, it provides the Supervisory Board with proposals for appointments and
reappointments to the Supervisory Board, its committees and the Managing Board. In March 2018,
Mr Veenhof, the chair of the RNC, resigned at the end of his term (after having been member of
NIBC’s Supervisory Board for 12 years). He was succeeded by Ms Zijderveld in August 2018. In the
time between the resignation of Mr Veenhof and the appointment of Ms Zijderveld, Mr van den
Goorbergh acted as chairman of the RNC.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 87
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee also assesses the performance of the members of
the Managing Board and the Supervisory Board and as at least annual meetings with the individual
MB members on their performance and team work. Please refer to the Remuneration Report for
further detail.
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee monitors the remuneration policy as well as the
execution of it, which entails discussing the total available pool for variable compensation and defining
the collective and individual performance targets that form the basis for the variable compensation of
individual members of the Managing Board. Furthermore, the committee oversees the remuneration
of the so-called Identified Staff employees whose professional activities have a material impact on
NIBC’s risk profile and determines the remuneration of the control functions.
In 2018, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee held five regular meetings, one additional
conference call and a meeting with the external executive search agency, all in the presence of NIBC’s
head of Human Resources and, in appropriate cases, of NIBC’s CEO. Additionally, the chair on behalf
of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee attended a meeting of the control functions. The
Remuneration and Nominating Committee discussed the regular subjects regarding remuneration,
risk and audit assessments, governance and variable income as well as the vacancies and nominations
for the Supervisory Board and its committees. NautaDutilh held interviews with all members of the
Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee as input for the yearly evaluation of the Supervisory
Board and the cooperation with and amongst the Managing Board/Executive Committee. The
evaluation was discussed in a private session of the Supervisory Board in November. In general the
Supervisory Board concluded that the information provided is at a very professional level, allowing
the Supervisory Board to have a good insight in the bank. The Supervisory Board noted that
meetings and discussions with the Managing Board/Executive Committee are open and transparent.
Especially the preparation of the Supervisory Board meetings through the Committees is perceived
as very valuable as this gives room for more detailed discussions. Based on this it was decided that all
Supervisory Board members will have a standing invitation to attend the Committees as a listener.
The chair of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee prepared the meetings of the RNC in
advance by having meetings/calls with the CEO and the head of Human Resources.
Remuneration management
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy this year, taking
into account relevant legislation and guidelines, amongst others the European Banking Authority (EBA)
guidelines on sound remuneration policies. Besides legislation, the RNC has taken market
circumstances and developments into consideration. The positioning of NIBC in relevant labour
markets was monitored by means of benchmark surveys. Attention was also paid to broader
developments in society, as the RNC is well aware of public concerns about remuneration in the
financial industry. The Supervisory Board amended the remuneration policy, fulfilling all legislative
changes as proposed by the Remuneration and Nominating Committee. The Remuneration and
Nominating Committee also discussed the performance of the Managing Board, the Executive
Committee and its members and set financial and non-financial targets. 
In 2017, the RNC started discussions and developed scenarios for retention packages for the
members of the Executive Committee in the light of the IPO. These discussions were concluded in
2018.
Given the importance of the subject, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee extensively
discussed the overall available funding for variable compensation and determined the proposed
distribution to Identified Staff. In this respect, the risk assessments (including malus and clawback
88 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
assessments) were discussed and taken into account in the decision making. The surrounding
governance and the developments in the area of governance and legislation were explicitly discussed
in the Remuneration and Nominating Committee, given the sensibility of the subject of remuneration.
The Committee also determined the obligatory disclosures on the Identified Staff and on the
remuneration policy.
In line with the Remuneration Policy the RNC received information for a hybrid benchmark peer
group reflecting the labour market of NIBC as well as a benchmark regarding post-employment
benefits. Given the specific circumstances and legislation for the (Dutch) financial institutions, more
specifically for banks, the Remuneration and Nominating Committee decided to also use a
benchmark of the Dutch banks. Based on this information the Remuneration and Nominating
Committee proposed to the Supervisory Board to present to the AGM 2019 a proposal to put a
system in place that determines the annual adjustment of salaries of the Members of the Managing
Board. Also for the Supervisory Board a proposal will be put forward to the AGM to put a system in
place that determines the annual adjustment of the annual fee of the members of the Supervisory
Board.
Succession management
On proposal of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee the Supervisory Board installed the
Executive Committee as of 1 January 2017. As mentioned earlier, the Executive Committee consists
of three Managing Board members and three non-statutory members representing the commercial
activities of NIBC.
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee also extensively discussed the succession
management regarding the Supervisory Board in the light of the resignation of three members as a
result of expiring terms of appointment. On its proposal the Supervisory Board decided to nominate
Ms Zijderveld and Ms Kemna as member of the Supervisory Board. Additionally, the Remuneration
and Nominating Committee started a new search, which is expected to lead to a new appointment
in 2019.
In its meetings the Remuneration and Nominating Committee has closely monitored management
development and succession management throughout the bank. The Committee’s previous chair held
regular talks with senior managers to gain a deeper understanding of their professional development
and of internal developments taking place within the bank. The new chair continued this custom.
Related Party Transactions Committee
The Related Party Transactions Committee (RPTC) assists the Supervisory Board in assessing material
transactions of any kind with a person or group of persons who hold, directly or indirectly, at least
10% of NIBC’s issued and outstanding share capital, or at least 10% of the voting rights at the Annual
General Meeting of shareholders. The same applies to any person affiliated with any such person(s)
that meet(s) these criteria. A transaction will, in any event, be considered material if the amount
involved exceeds EUR 10 million. The Supervisory Board has delegated the authority to approve
such material transactions to the Related Party Transactions Committee.
In a RPTC meeting end of February, the RPTC reconfirmed its approval to the Managing Board’s
decision to indirectly participate up to a certain maximum amount in the HSH transaction.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 89
REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
Financial statements
The company and consolidated financial statements have been drawn up by the Managing Board and
audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, who issued an unqualified opinion dated 26 February
2019. The Supervisory Board recommends that shareholders adopt the 2018 Financial Statements at
the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 26 April 2019. The Supervisory Board also
recommends that the Annual General Meeting of shareholders discharge the Managing Board and
Supervisory Board for their respective management and supervision during the financial year 2018.
The Supervisory Board would like to express its gratitude to all our stakeholders who helped to
make 2018 the big success it was, most notably to our nearly 700 highly professional, entrepreneurial
and inventive employees. Thanks to their skills, expertise, agility and dedication NIBC could achieve
these great results.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
At NIBC, we endeavour to maintain a sound, transparent and effective governance system that is
aligned to best practices in our industry. The Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Dutch Banking
Code form the base of our governance system and guide the way we work at NIBC.
This chapter contains some highlights of our governance structure in 2018. The structures and
processes we have developed provide an effective basis for making and implementing decisions across
our organisation, with its hierarchical and functional reporting lines.
Our website contains our articles of association, charters, relevant policies and other information on
corporate governance and the compliance statements with respect to the Dutch Banking Code and
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. To the extent applicable, NIBC also adheres to
international governance standards such as the EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance.
Two-tier board structure
As a large company, NIBC Holding N.V. is subject to the Large Company Regime (structuurregime), a
regime that is obliged to install a supervisory board.
As a result, NIBC maintains a two-tier board structure consisting of a Managing Board and a
Supervisory Board. The Managing Board is responsible for the day-to-day management, which
includes, among other things, formulating NIBC’s strategy and policies and setting and achieving
NIBC’s objectives. The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Managing Board. It is the
Board’s priority to protect the interests of the company and its operations, rather than the interests
of any particular stakeholder.
The major subsidiaries, NIBC Bank N.V., has voluntarily adopted a two-tier board structure. It has
been agreed in the charter of the Supervisory Board that the composition of the Supervisory Board
of NIBC Bank N.V. will be identical to the composition of the Supervisory Board of NIBC Holding
N.V.
Managing Board
In 2018, NIBC had three Managing Board members. These members have thorough and in-depth
knowledge of the financial sector in general and the banking sector in particular.
For the composition of the Managing Board as per 31 December 2018, refer to the following table:
Name Year of birth Nationality Member since End of term1
Mr. P.A.M. de Wilt (Chairman, CEO) 1964 Dutch 2014 2022
Mr. H.H.J. Dijkhuizen (Chief Financial Officer) 1960 Dutch 2013 2021
Mr. R.D.J. van Riel (Chief Risk Officer) 1970 Dutch 2016 2020
1 These are the dates until which the appointment as statutory director runs. They do not refer to the expiry of employment contracts.
In case of a vacancy in the Managing Board, the regular policy is applied and the Executive Search
team is asked to provide a shortlist with at least 50% female candidates, although final selection is
ultimately based on the suitability for the position. At the level of the Executive Committee, NIBC
meets the diversity requirements (see below). NIBC will also continue to strive for a good gender
balance at Managing Board level.
Executive Committee
As at 1 January 2017 an Executive Committee was formed consisting of the three Managing Board
members and three non-statutory members representing commercial roles. The Executive
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 93
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Committee consists of two female members and four male members. The Managing Board and the
Executive Committee, which meet weekly, represent and balance the interests of all stakeholders.
The non-statutory Executive Committee members participate in the discussions in meetings, but are
not entitled to a vote.
In 2018, there were no transactions in which the members of the Managing Board or the members
of the Executive Committee had a conflict of interest. More information about the Managing Board
and the Executive Committee, including short biographies, can be found on our website.
Managing Board Germany
NIBC Bank Deutschland AG is a full subsidiary of NIBC Bank N.V. At 31 December 2018, the
Vorstand (Managing Board) of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG comprised Mr. T.A. Rasser and Mr. J.B.
Spanjersberg. Mr. Buncsak stepped down from the Vorstand as per May 2018 and subsequently Mr.
T.A. Rasser was appointed CEO of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG. Members of the Aufsichtsrat
(Supervisory Board) of NIBC Bank Deutschland AG are Mr. H.H.J. Dijkhuizen, Ms. S.M. Hovers and
Mr. P. Zippro.
Supervisory Board
On 31 December 2018, the Supervisory Board of NIBC consisted of seven members with extensive
and international expertise in fields such as banking and finance, corporate governance and
corporate management.
In 2018, three members of the Supervisory Board resigned as per the end of their respective terms.
On 30 March 2018 Mr Veenhof resigned, on 19 August 2018 Ms Steel resigned and on
14 December 2018 Mr de Jong resigned from NIBC’s Supervisory Board.
Because 2018 was a year of strategical importance, stability was key for NIBC’s Supervisory Board. In
January 2018, for that reason, Supervisory Board’s chairman Mr van den Goorbergh was reappointed
for maximum one more year till the AGM in 2019.
On 27 August 2018, Ms Zijderveld and Ms Kemna were appointed as Supervisory Board member
and respectively chair of the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and chair of the Risk Policy &
Compliance Committee.
For more information on our Supervisory Board, including a complete list of all members and
Committees, please see the Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report or visit our
website.
Dutch Corporate Governance Code
NIBC supports and actively applies the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. This
Code has been revised in December 2016 and consequently implemented by NIBC.
NIBC partly deviates from two best practices and principles as laid out in the Code:
The main deviation is that we do not comply with best practice provision 2.1.7 (iii), which requires
that there is at most one supervisory board member who can be considered to be affiliated with a
shareholder, or group of affiliated shareholders, who holds more than 10 per cent of the shares in a
company. Four out of seven members of NIBC’s Supervisory Board qualify as formally independent.
The other three members are formally not independent, because they are representatives of our
major shareholder (75%). This principle in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code deviates from the
94 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
policy of the Dutch central bank (DNB) that came into force in 2012. DNB’s policy is that at least
50% of the members of a Supervisory Board should be formally independent. NIBC complies with
the DNB policy.
In addition, NIBC is not in compliance with best practice provision 2.2.2. This best practice provision
requires that supervisory board members are reappointed for a period of two years in the event of a
reappointment after an eight-year period, which appointment may be extended by at most two
years. The Company’s Supervisory Board members can be appointed for a period of four years after
an eight-year period, provided that no Supervisory Board member shall hold office for more than
three four-year terms or twelve years, as the case may be. Because 2018 was a year of strategic
importance, stability was key for NIBC’s Supervisory Board and both Mr de Jong and Mr van den
Goorbergh were reappointed in 2017 and 2018 respectively for a maximum term of one year and as
a result held office for more than twelve years. Mr de Jong‘s final term ended in December 2018 and
Mr van den Goorbergh’s final term will end in April 2019 at the AGM.
Dutch Banking Code
The updated Dutch Banking Code came into effect as legislation on 1 January 2015, after a decree by
the Dutch Minister of Finance. The Banking Code is part of a package called ‘Future-oriented
banking’. In addition to the Banking Code, Future-oriented banking introduces a Social Charter and
rules of conduct associated with the Bankers’ Oath and disciplinary rules for employees of banks in
the Netherlands. Before 1 January 2015 the Dutch Banking Code was a form of self-regulation.
The Dutch Banking Code, together with the introduction of the Social Charter and the
implementation of the Bankers' Oath, is applicable to all employees of financial institutions in the
Netherlands. NIBC supports the principles of the Banking Code to regain trust, ensure stability and
protect the interests of our stakeholders.
NIBC has implemented all procedural and operational measures required under the Dutch Banking
Code. Our governance is fully aligned with the Banking Code. We also aligned our remuneration
policies for staff and Managing Board with the Banking Code. Ever since the code came into effect,
we have been running a programme for lifelong learning and hold regular training sessions for the
Managing Board and the Supervisory Board, as is required by the Banking Code.
Among other things the Banking Code requires banks to operate in a sound and ethical way. Our
mission, strategy and objectives reflect this; they can be found on our website. Being in line with this
are the NIBC3, our three corporate values: professional, entrepreneurial and inventive. The NIBC3
are the foundation of all our company’s activities, including our products and services, as well as our
general performance, behaviour, attitude and the targets we set for our employees. Integrity is
considered an essential part of the core value 'professional'.
NIBC’s Code of Conduct guides us in the way we work at NIBC. Key themes are: doing the right
thing, following the letter and the spirit of rules and doing what we say. You can find the Code of
Conduct, including a one page abbreviation for daily use, on our website. 
A detailed explanation of the Dutch Banking Code and an overview of NIBC’s compliance with it can
be found on our website. 
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 95
REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION REPORT
The Supervisory Board reviewed and amended NIBC’s remuneration policy in 2018. The review took
into account all relevant laws, regulations and guidelines: the Dutch Corporate Governance Code; the
Dutch Banking Code; the DNB Principles on Sound Remuneration Policies (DNB principles), EBA
Guidelines on Sound Remuneration; and CRD IV and the Dutch remuneration legislation for financial
services companies (Wet beloningsbeleid financiële onderneming, Wbfo).
NIBC’s remuneration policy and Managing Board remuneration for 2018 are outlined in this chapter.
An overview of the remuneration of other staff and the Supervisory Board is also presented. Please
see our website for further information about the remuneration policy.
To avoid unnecessary duplication, we refer to note 9 and 56 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
in this Annual Report for all relevant tables. These are considered to be an integral part of this
Remuneration Report.
Remuneration principles
NIBC’s remuneration policy is sustainable, balanced and in line with our chosen strategy and risk
appetite. It revolves around these five key principles: remuneration is (i) aligned with NIBC’s business
strategy and risk appetite; (ii) appropriately balanced between short and long term; (iii) differentiated
and linked to the achievement of performance objectives and the results of NIBC; (iv) externally
competitive and internally fair; and (v) managed in an integrated manner that takes into account total
compensation.
Managing Board remuneration in 2018
In order to determine appropriate market levels of remuneration for the Managing Board, the
Supervisory Board has identified a hybrid benchmark peer group, consisting of all AEX and AMX
(both Euronext) listed companies. Given the specific circumstances and legislation for the (Dutch)
financial institutions, more specifically banks, the Supervisory Board decided to also use a benchmark
of other Dutch banks. The composition of these peer groups reflects the labour market in which
NIBC competes for talent. As such, it is an objective measure outside NIBC’s control.
Throughout the cycle, total compensation for the CEO and members of the Managing Board is
targeted just below the median of their peers in the peer group, based on benchmark data provided
by external independent compensation consultants and publicly available information.
Base salaries
In 2018, the base salary for the CEO was EUR 825,000 gross per year (2017: EUR 800,000). The
base salary for the two other members of the Managing Board was EUR 600,000 gross per year
(2017: EUR 550,000). Base salaries are paid in 12 equal monthly payments.
Variable compensation
According to the remuneration policy, the variable income component in 2018 for the Managing
Board is set at 15% of base salary at target achievement, with a maximum of 20% of the base salary.
Over 2018 the following incentive compensations of base salary were granted: Chief Executive
Officer 20%, Chief Financial Officer 20% and Chief Risk Officer 20%. The Supervisory Board decided
to award the maximum variable compensation in view of meeting all disclosed medium term
objectives as well as the performance on the individual targets set and reviewed by the RNC. These
individual targets include both financial and non-financial objectives.
For all members of the Managing Board this variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined mix:
30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in phantom share units (PSUs) and 20% in unvested PSUs. In
96 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REMUNERATION REPORT
this way, NIBC complies with regulations (EBA/Wbfo) that require Identified Staff to receive 50% of
all variable compensation in the form of equity or equity-linked instruments and for at least 40% of
both the cash and equity component to be deferred. For the Managing Board, the holding period of
the equity-linked instruments is set to five years as required by the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code.
Retention package
In the preparation for the IPO, various stakeholders (potential investors, selling shareholder who also
remains a shareholder, Supervisory Board, but also e.g. regulators) deemed retention of the Executive
Committee necessary, as the stakeholders would like to ensure stability at the highest level before,
during and after the IPO. The retention package was designed in such a way that those interests are
safeguarded and in line with applicable legislation and regulations. In the context of the IPO the Dutch
Central Bank (DNB) has given its consent to award the retention package within the meaning of
article 1:122 of the FMSA and in accordance with the procedure of article 94 (1)(g) under (ii) of
CRD IV. Shareholders of NIBC approved the retention package. The retention package consists of
two parts, the first (60%) subject to continued employment until the date of the IPO and the second
(40%) subject to continued employment until the first anniversary of the IPO. Both parts are subject
to the rules on deferral and retention (lock-up period). The retention packages amount to 180% of
the annual base salary for the Members of the Managing Boards and to 165% of the annual base
salary for the non-statutory members of the Executive Committee. The pay-out of the retention
packages will be subject to the regular requirements on pay-out to Identified Staff, hence an ex-post
risk analysis will be conducted prior to vesting and deferral will be applied, in line with 'Richtlijn
Beheerst Beloningsbeleid 2017' and the EBA guidelines. Moreover a lock-up of 5 years, following the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code, is applicable and is also applied to the retention package for the
non-statutory members of the Executive Committee.
Pension
The CEO and other Managing Board members participate in the NIBC pension plan, in line with the
arrangements available to all other employees. In 2018, the pension plan consisted of a) a collective
defined-contribution pension arrangement (CDC arrangement) up to a maximum pensionable salary
of EUR 105,075 maximum salary, and; b) an additional (gross) contribution up to their respective
base salaries. The retirement age for the CEO and members of the Managing Board was 68 in 2018.
There are no contractual early retirement provisions.
For the CDC arrangement NIBC pays a standard flat-rate contribution of 26.2% into the pension
fund (for the Managing Board as well as for all other employees). All employees are required to make
a personal contribution of 4.2% of their pensionable salary in the CDC arrangement. The gross
contribution by NIBC for pensions above the fiscal maximum is set at 25%.
Other key benefits
The CEO and members of the Managing Board are entitled to a company car up to a certain price
limit or, if they prefer, the equivalent value of the lease car limit as a gross cash allowance. The CEO is
entitled to the use of a permanent chauffeur from the chauffeurs' pool whilst the other members of
the Managing Board are entitled to the use of a chauffeur from the pool for business purposes only
unless otherwise agreed by the Supervisory Board.
As is the case with all our employees, the members of the Managing Board are entitled to a
contribution towards their disability insurance, accident insurance and permanent travel insurance.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 97
REMUNERATION REPORT
Employment contracts
The CEO and members of the Managing Board all have indefinite employment contracts, which are
fully compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Their appointment to the Managing
Board is for a maximum term of four years. The term can be renewed.
Any severance payment is limited to 12 months’ base salary and will not be awarded if the agreement
with the member of the Managing Board is terminated early at the initiative of the member of the
Managing Board, or in the .event of seriously culpable or negligent behaviour on the part of the
member of the Managing Board.
Amendments in 2019
The Supervisory Board reviews base salary levels regularly and may decide to adjust it. In 2018, the
Remuneration and Nominating Committee (RNC) of the Supervisory Board thoroughly reviewed the
Managing Board remuneration. Hereby it took into account all relevant benchmarks, such as the
hybrid benchmark peer group in the relevant environment for NIBC, as well as a benchmark
regarding the post-employment benefits. The benchmark of Dutch banks was also explicitly included
in the assessment, in view of the recent developments with regard to salary and variable income.
Based on this information, the Supervisory Board will present to the Annual General Meeting a
proposal to put a system in place that determines the annual adjustment of the salaries of the
members of the Managing Board.
Other staff remuneration
In line with the DNB Principles, employees whose professional activities have a material impact on
NIBC’s risk profile are designated Identified Staff. Specific remuneration conditions may apply to
Identified Staff (other than Managing Board members). The outlines of the remuneration policies for
Identified Staff and other staff are given below. For further details on the policies for Identified Staff,
please see our website.
Total compensation funding
Each year, based on a proposal by the Managing Board, the Supervisory Board decides, at its
discretion, on the overall amount of money available for total compensation, the amount of money
available for variable compensation and the specific forms in which variable compensation may be
awarded. The 2018 compensation ratio (total compensation costs as percentage of operating
income) was 19.2%.
Variable compensation
All employees with a function contract have a pre-agreed set of financial and non-financial (at least
50%) performance targets. Their performance assessments take into account the achievement of pre-
agreed targets, how they have behaved according to NIBC’s corporate values, as well as their
contributions towards the bank’s longer-term objectives. Non-financial performance aspects include
client satisfaction, employee satisfaction, transparency, and sustainability. The Dutch Banking Code
serves as a guideline for all employees.
Whether or not an employee actually receives a variable compensation for his or her performance, is
wholly discretionary and depends on the overall financial and non-financial performance of the bank,
of the respective business unit, personal performance and relevant market levels of remuneration.
Employees do not qualify for variable remuneration if their performance has been inadequate or
poor, if they have failed to meet duty-of-care or compliance requirements, if they have displayed

action.
98 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REMUNERATION REPORT
Both for the Managing Board and employees, the variable compensation, if any, is delivered in various
components:
1. cash;
2. deferred cash;
3. vested phantom share units;
4. unvested PSUs.
The Managing Board determines the precise split between cash and equity or equity-linked
components, the proportion of deferred compensation and the form in which this is distributed
(such as cash or unvested equity), whether a threshold applies for the deferred component and, if so,
how high that threshold is.
For Identified Staff, no threshold applies and any variable compensation is delivered in a pre-defined
mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in PSUs and 20% in unvested PSUs. In this way, NIBC
complies with regulations that require Identified Staff to receive 50% of all variable compensation in
the form of equity or equity-linked instruments and for at least 40% of both the cash and equity
component to be deferred.
For employees with a scale contract (in the Netherlands) it has been agreed upon that they will
receive an on-off fixed amount of EUR 1,250 over 2018, which qualifies as variable compensation.
Special situations
Only in exceptional cases and only in the first year of employment the Managing Board can offer sign-
on or guaranteed minimum bonuses to new employees and retention bonuses to existing employees.
In the unlikely event that these bonuses amount to more than 100% of the base salary of the
individual employee concerned, procedures will be followed in accordance with the regulations; the
maximum ratio between fixed and variable remuneration will be respected. Beside the mentioned
retention packages in light of the IPO, this has not occurred in 2018.
Any severance payment made if NIBC terminates employment without cause, is subject to local
legislation. For the Netherlands, the prevailing business court guidelines (transition formula) and, in
the case of reorganisation, NIBC’s Social Protocol, are applicable. Special compensation plans for
specific groups of employees are subject to prior approval by the Managing Board, which annually
informs the Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board about these
arrangements.
Pension amendments in 2018
The pension scheme for employees is amended as of 1 January 2018. The retirement age has
become 68 years (2017: 67 years) to comply with the 2018 fiscal legislation. This is also applicable for
all members of the Managing Board. As of 2018 the financial agreement has been renewed for three
years (2018-2020). NIBC pays a standard flat rate contribution of 26.2% (2017: 22.0%) into the
pension fund for the CDC arrangement. All employees (including the Managing Board) are required
to make a personal contribution of 4.2% (2017: 4.0%) of their pensionable salary into the CDC
arrangement as from 1 January 2018.
The gross contribution for pensions above the fiscal maximum is now set at 25% (until 2017 this
contribution was age dependent).
Supervisory Board remuneration in 2018
The Supervisory Board remuneration was adjusted in 2017 and was not changed in 2018.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 99
REMUNERATION REPORT
The chairman of the Supervisory Board is entitled to an annual fee of EUR 75,000 (2017:
EUR 75,000), the vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board is entitled to an annual fee of EUR 60,000
(2017: EUR 60,000) and the other members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to an annual fee
of EUR 50,000 (2017: EUR 50,000).
In addition, the chair of the AC, RPCC and RNC of the Supervisory Board are entitled to an annual
fee of EUR 15,000. Members of the Audit Committee are entitled to an annual fee of EUR 10,000
(2017: EUR 10,000). The members of the Risk Policy & Compliance Committee are also entitled to
an annual fee of EUR 10,000 (2017: EUR 10,000). The members of the Remuneration and
Nominating Committee are entitled to an annual fee of EUR 7,500 (2017: EUR 7,500). The members
of the Related Party Transaction Committee are entitled to an annual fee of nil (2017: nil).
All members of the Supervisory Board are entitled to reimbursement of genuine business expenses
incurred while fulfilling their duties. For the Supervisory Board a proposal will be put forward to the
AGM to put a system in place that determines the annual adjustment of the annual fee of the
members of the Supervisory Board.
Remuneration governance
In line with the various recommendations and guidelines issued by regulators, NIBC has strengthened
governance around the annual remuneration process and agreed upon key roles for the Human
Resources, Risk Management, Compliance, Audit and Finance functions (control functions).
The Supervisory Board discussed the performance and remuneration of Identified Staff, as well as the
performance and remuneration of control functions. The Supervisory Board also discussed the
highest proposed variable compensations in 2018. Scenario analyses were conducted by Risk
Management to assess the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components on an
individual and collective basis. The internal annual report 'Harrewijn' is discussed in the RNC as well
as with the Works Council. Amongst others the report covers an internal pay ratio analysis.
In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, NIBC discloses the relevant elements related to
the internal pay ratios. In 2018 the base salary pay ratio of the CEO (EUR 825,000) compared to the
median full-time salary of all employees (EUR 77,775) was 11 (2017: 10).
Adjustments
Any vested amounts of variable remuneration are subject to clawback by the Supervisory Board in
the event they have been based on inaccurate financial or other data, fraud, or when the employee in
question is dismissed ‘for cause’. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, the Supervisory Board has
the discretion to adjust downwards any or all variable remuneration if, in its opinion, this
remuneration could have unfair or unintended effects. In assessing performance against pre-agreed
performance criteria, financial performance shall be adjusted to allow for estimated risks and capital
costs. In addition to clawbacks, the concept of ‘malus’ is part of the remuneration policy. This is an
arrangement that permits NIBC to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of deferred
compensation in relation to risk outcomes of performance. Malus is a form of ex-post risk
adjustment, one of the key requirements in addition to ex-ante risk adjustments.
If an employee resigns, any unvested amounts of compensation are forfeited.
Conclusion
The Remuneration and Nominating Committee and the Supervisory Board believe NIBC’s
remuneration policy responsibly links performance and reward and is compliant with the applicable
100 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
REMUNERATION REPORT
laws, regulations and guidelines. The Supervisory Board continues to believe in prudent management
of remuneration whilst recognising that NIBC operates in a competitive market place where it needs
to be able to attract, motivate and retain sufficient talent.
NIBC is determined to make a positive contribution towards fair compensation practices in the
banking sector in consultation with its stakeholders. Furthermore, we aim to create the level playing
field that regulators envisage with regard to variable compensation.
Disclosure on Dutch remuneration legislation for financial services companies
The total amount of variable income granted in 2019, with respect to the performance over 2018,
amounts to EUR 8.1 million. This grant consists of (direct and deferred) cash and (vested and
unvested) share based instruments. In 2018 six employees (2017: one employee) were awarded a
total compensation of more than EUR 1.0 million. The increase is related to the awarded retention
package for the Executive Committee and may therefore be considered a one-time increase.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 101
IN CONTROL REPORT
IN CONTROL REPORT
The responsibilities of the Managing Board are anchored in the principles of the Dutch Financial
Supervision Act (Wet op het financiële toezicht) and other regulations. These responsibilities include
compliance with relevant legislation and the implementation and operation of risk management and
control systems. These management and control systems aim to ensure reliable financial reporting
and to control the downside risk to the operational and financial objectives of NIBC.
Risk management and control
In discharging its responsibility regarding internal risk management and control systems, the Managing
Board acknowledges that in the normal course of business, shortcomings in processes and
procedures arise. The Managing Board has made an assessment of the effectiveness of NIBC’s internal
control and risk management systems. Following identification of any shortcomings, mitigating
controls are performed to determine that no material weaknesses or major control deficiencies
remain. Based on this assessment and to the best of its knowledge, the Managing Board states that:
■ the Report of the Managing Board in the Annual Report 2018 of NIBC provides a fair overview of
and insight into the effectiveness as well as shortcomings of the internal risk management and
control systems;
■ NIBC’s internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that NIBC
Bank N.V.’s Annual Report does not contain any errors of material importance. To address
identified weaknesses, additional mitigating controls have been performed where necessary;
■ there is a reasonable expectation that NIBC Holding N.V. will be able to continue in operation and
meet its liabilities for at least twelve months, as evidenced by the details included in 'performance
evaluation', therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements;
■ there are no material risks or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the continuity of NIBC Bank N.V.'s enterprise in the coming twelve months.
It should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide
absolute assurance as to the realisation of operational and strategic business objectives, or that they
can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules
and regulations. Nor can they provide certainty that we will achieve our objectives.
In view of the above, the Managing Board of NIBC believes it is in compliance with the requirements
of best practice provision 1.2 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
Responsibility statement
In respect of Article 5:25c, Section 2 (c) (1 and 2) of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the
members of the Managing Board of NIBC hereby confirm, to the best of their knowledge, that:
■ The annual company and consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and income statement of NIBC and its consolidated group companies;
■ The Report of the Managing Board gives a true and fair view of the situation on the balance sheet
date and developments during the financial year of NIBC and its consolidated group companies; 
■ The Report of the Managing Board describes the material risks which NIBC faces.

authorised for issue by the Supervisory Board and Managing Board on 26 February 2019. NIBC Bank
N.V. is a public liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 31 October 1945, and registered
at Carnegieplein 4, 2517 KJ The Hague, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number
27032036). NIBC Bank N.V. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NIBC Holding N.V.
NIBC Bank N.V. together with its subsidiaries (NIBC or the group), provides a broad range of
financial services to corporate - and retail clients. Refer to the Segment report in these financial
statements and the Report of the Managing Board in this Annual Report for detail.
Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless
stated otherwise. Where considered necessary comparative figures have been adjusted to conform
to changes in presentation in the current year.
Statement of compliance
NIBC’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (together IFRS-EU) and with Title 9
of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention,
except for:
■ Financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments, equity investments (including
investments in associates) and certain classes of (investment) property measured at fair value
through profit or loss (FVtPL);
■ Financial assets held for both collecting contractual cash flows and sale measured at fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);
■ Assets held for sale measured at fair value less cost to sell.
All figures are rounded to the nearest EUR million, except when otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS-EU requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying
NIBC’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed
in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements section.
Changes in accounting policies in 2018
Changes in IFRS-EU
New standards and amendments to standards become effective at the date specified by IFRS-EU, but
may allow companies to opt for an earlier application date. In 2018, the following standards or
amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB, and relevant for NIBC, were implemented:

1 NIBC early applied the own credit requirements introduced by IFRS 9 in isolation, without applying the other requirements of IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2016.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
Effective 1 January 2018, NIBC applied IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, which replaces IAS 39, Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and substantially changes accounting and financial
reporting in three key areas: classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment and hedge
accounting. NIBC has retained hedge accounting under IAS 39 as permitted and early applied the
own credit requirements of IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2016 and onwards.
The introduction of IFRS 9 gave NIBC the one-off opportunity to revise the accounting classification
made at initial recognition for certain financial instruments.
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, NIBC elected not to restate comparative
figures. Any effect on the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities at the date of
transition to IFRS 9 was recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings and/or the revaluation
reserve of financial assets. The detailed effects of the application of IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018 are
presented in this section as follows:
Transition impact IFRS 9
■ Transition to classification and measurement requirements;
■ Transition to expected credit loss (ECL) requirements;
■ Reclassification and re-measurement of carrying amounts and recognition of ECL;
■ Reconciliation of allowances and provisions on application date of IFRS 9;
■ IFRS 9 transition impact on equity.
Transition to classification and measurement requirements
For NIBC, the most significant IFRS 9 classification and measurement changes on transition to IFRS 9
are as follows:
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 115
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ the mortgage loans own book and securitised mortgage loans formerly designated at FVtPL are
reclassified to AC;
■ within the corporate loan portfolio certain loans formerly classified at FVtPL are reclassified to
AC, and vice versa;
■ debt investments formerly classified as available-for-sale are reclassified to FVOCI, AC or for a
small part to FVtPL;
■ equity investments formerly classified as available-for-sale are reclassified to FVtPL.
The accounting classification of the mortgage loans at FVtPL under IAS 39 was revisited at the
introduction date of IFRS 9 as all mortgage loans are already managed under a business model that
complies with the conditions for AC at that date. Furthermore the mortgage loans give rise to
specific cash flows that are SPPI.
Except for the reclassification effect of mortgage loans designated at FVtPL to AC, NIBC notes there
is a limited impact on equity related to changes in classification. The negative reclassification effect of
mortgage loans designated at FVtPL to AC is EUR 331 million, which is the result of revoking the
previous fair value designation. Consequently the reclassification effect is equal to the fair value
adjustment after initial recognition of the relevant mortgage loans designated at FVtPL as per
31 December 2017. The impact was primarily driven by market interest rates as these have had a
material impact on the fair value development of the portfolio. The reclassification effect of mortgage
loans designated at FVtPL to AC on the regulatory capital leads to a decrease of the fully loaded CET
1 ratio of NIBC of approximately 3.4% at 1 January 2018.
The gross fair value loss that would have been recognised in the income statement over the year
2018 if the mortgage loans (own book and securitised) had not been reclassified from FVtPL to AC
at 1 January 2018 amounts to EUR 66 million. Of this amount, EUR 53 million would have to be
adjusted to net interest income as reported under IFRS 9. The remainder would be adjusted within
net trading income.
The EIR of the different financial instruments is not significantly affected as a result of the
reclassifications and re-measurements due to the application of IFRS 9.
The presentation of the comparative figures for interest income and interest expense, as a
consequence of the introduction of IFRS 9, are aligned with the required presentation of IFRS 9.
NIBC voluntary changed the presentation of the interest expenses in the face of the income
statement to align the presentation of interest expenses with the presentation of interest income as
required under IAS 1.82(a).
Transition to expected credit loss (ECL) requirements
As set out in the 'Expected credit losses' section in the accounting policies, estimating ECL requires,
amongst others, considerations of multiple forward-looking scenarios, whereby the final ECL is an
average of the ECLs calculated under the different scenarios. As from 1 January 2018, key decisions
were implemented into ECL models and risk management processes. All relevant ECL models have
been validated by a third party. Furthermore risk and finance processes and systems have been
adjusted to support the required ECL-calculations, administrative processing and reporting.
Following the transition to IFRS 9, a more volatile impairment charge is expected on the back of
macroeconomic predictions.
116 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
With the introduction of IFRS 9, NIBC will no longer report incurred but not reported (IBNR)
impairment losses. This will partially offset the impact of ECL impairment allowances.
Reclassification and re-measurement of carrying amounts and recognition of ECL
The following table provides a detailed overview of the IFRS 9 transition effects as of 1 January 2018.
This includes:
■ reclassification of IAS 39 carrying amounts to the new categories applicable under IFRS 9;
■ remeasurement of carrying amounts due to reclassification;
■ recognition of IFRS 9 ECL and reversal of IAS 39 allowances.
The following table also includes the effects recognised for deferred tax assets and therefore the total
impact provided in equity in the table is net of tax effects.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 addresses pre-payable financial assets that would otherwise
meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criterion would be eligible to be measured at
AC or FVOCI –subject to the business model assessment – if the following conditions are met: the
instrument is inconsistent with the SPPI-criterion only because the party that chooses (or causes) to
terminate the contract early may receive reasonable additional compensation for doing so (first
eligibility condition); and the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant on initial recognition
of the financial asset (second eligibility condition). The amendments are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. NIBC early adopted the amendments to IFRS 9 as per
1 January 2018. These amendments to IFRS 9 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated
financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Effective from 1 January 2018, NIBC applied IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (IFRS
15), which replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and establishes principles for revenue recognition that apply to
all contracts with customers except those relating to financial instruments and insurance or lease
contracts and requires an entity to recognise revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. NIBC
applied the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative effect of initial application of IFRS 15 is
nil.
Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
On 12 April 2016, the IASB has issued amendments to its new revenue standard, IFRS 15. The
amendments address implementation questions that were discussed by the Joint Transition Resource
Group for Revenue Recognition on: identifying performance obligations; application guidance on
principal versus agent and licenses of intellectual property; and transition. The amendments are also
intended to help ensure a more consistent application when entities adopt IFRS 15 and decrease the
cost and complexity of applying it.
NIBC applied these amendments as from the effective date of 1 January 2018.
IFRIC 22, Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
The interpretation clarifies that in determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of
the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or
non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on
which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the
advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must
determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. The
interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The adoption of
this IFRS Interpretation did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The interpretation is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused
tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments
under IAS 12. NIBC early adopted this IFRS interpretation with no material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property
The IASB has amended the requirements in IAS 40 Investment property on when a company should
transfer a property asset to, or from, investment property. Under the amended IAS 40, a property
asset is transferred when, and only when, there is evidence of an actual change in its use. The
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 121
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The adoption of the
amendments to IAS 40 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the
effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction;
the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding
tax obligations; and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based
payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled. The amendments
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The adoption of these
amendments did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 123
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The not yet endorsed upcoming amendments are not expected to have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of NIBC and its
subsidiaries as at and for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017.
Subsidiaries
The group’s subsidiaries are those entities (including structured entities) which it directly or indirectly
controls. Control over an entity is evidenced by the group’s ability to exercise its power in order to
affect any variable returns that the group is exposed to through its involvement with the entity. The
group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored
by third parties for a variety of reasons, including allowing customers to hold investments in separate
legal entities, allowing customers to invest jointly in alternative assets, for asset securitisation
transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection.
When assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the group evaluates a range of control factors,
namely:
■ the purpose and design of the entity;
■ the relevant activities and how these are determined;
■ whether the group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities;
■ whether the group has exposure or rights to variable returns;
■ whether the group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.
Where voting rights are relevant, the group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or
indirectly, more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another
investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities, as indicated by one or
more of the following factors:
■ another investor has the power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement
with the group; or
■ another investor has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee
under a statute or an agreement; or
■ another investor has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board
of directors or equivalent governing body and the investee is controlled by that board or body; or
■ another investor has the power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors
or equivalent governing body and control of that entity is by this board or body.
Potential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.
Likewise, the group also assesses the existence of control where it does not control the majority of
the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise
in circumstances where the size and dispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the group the
power to direct the activities of the investee.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group and are
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The group reassesses the consolidation status at least at each financial reporting date. Therefore, any
changes in the structure leading to a change in one or more of the control factors require
reassessment when they occur. This includes changes in decision making rights, changes in contractual
124 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
arrangements, changes in the financing, ownership or capital structure as well as changes following a
trigger event which was anticipated in the original documentation.
The group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The
consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred,
the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages,
the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquire is re-
measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement
are recognised in the income statement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,
the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquired entity and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference
is recognised directly in the income statement presented under other operating income as negative
goodwill. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the
contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for
within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are
recognised in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of
impairment of the assets transferred. The accounting policies of subsidiaries (including structured
entities that the bank consolidates) have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the accounting policies adopted by NIBC.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as
equity transactions, that is as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of
net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling
interests are also recorded in equity.
Disposal of subsidiaries
When the group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured at its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in the income
statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting
for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if
the group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This may mean that amounts
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement
(investment income).
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 125
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control. Significant
influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also
is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not
limited to one or more of the following:
■ Representation in the board of directors;
■ Participation in the policymaking process;
■ Interchange of managerial personnel.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The group’s share of post-acquisition results of associates and joint ventures is recognised in the
income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is
recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount
of the investment in associates and joint ventures. When the group’s share of losses in an associate
and joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate and joint venture, the group does not
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on
behalf of the associate or joint venture.
The group’s investments in its associates and joint ventures are, except as otherwise described below,
accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a
joint venture is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to
recognise the group’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture after the date of
acquisition. The group’s investment in associates or joint ventures includes goodwill identified on
acquisition. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of
the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The group determines at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the
investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the group calculates the
amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint
venture and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to investment income (sub line
item share in result of associates) in the income statement.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associate or joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses
are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
If the interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate
share of amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the
income statement, where appropriate.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the group
measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the income
126 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
statement. If applicable, dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in
the income statement.
With effect from 1 January 2007, all newly acquired investments in associates and joint ventures held
by venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds (as that term is used in IAS 28 and IFRS
11) that qualify as a joint venture or associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value
through profit or loss. Interests held by the group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and
investment funds that are managed on a fair value basis are also accounted for as investments held at
fair value through profit or loss.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segment, has been identified as the Managing
Board of NIBC. For details of NIBC’s operating segments see note 1.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in EUR, the functional currency and
presentation currency of NIBC.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement,
except when deferred in equity (other comprehensive income net of tax) as qualifying net investment
hedges.
Changes in the fair value of monetary loans denominated in foreign currency that are classified at fair
value through other comprehensive income (formerly available for sale) are analysed between foreign
exchange translation differences and other changes in the carrying amount of the loan. Foreign
exchange translation differences are recognised in the income statement and other changes in the
carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Foreign exchange translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair
value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences
on non-monetary items classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (formerly
available for sale) are included in the revaluation reserve in other comprehensive income.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a
hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
■ Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date
of that balance sheet;
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 127
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates
of the transactions);
■ All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other
comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign
entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments,
are taken to shareholder’s equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, or partially disposed of,
such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Financial instruments
Recognition and classification and measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are
recognised on trade-date, the date on which NIBC commits to purchase or sell the asset.
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost (AC), fair value
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVtPL).
A debt instrument is measured at AC if it meets both of the following conditions:
■ it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual
cash flows;
■ the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).
A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions:
■ it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets;
■ the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are SPPI.
Equity instruments are accounted for at FVtPL. Other financial assets, not specifically mentioned
above, are measured at FVtPL and consist of held for trading assets, assets mandatorily measured on
a fair value basis and derivatives.
Forward purchases and sales other than those requiring delivery within the time frame established by
regulation or market convention are treated as derivative forward contracts.
Business model assessment
NIBC determines the nature of the business model, for example if the objective is to hold the
financial asset and collect the contractual cash flows, by considering the way in which the financial
assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective as determined by management.
128 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial assets that are held for trading or managed on a fair value basis are measured at FVtPL
insofar as the associated business model is neither to hold the financial assets to collect contractual
cash flows nor to hold to collect contractual cash flows and sell.
NIBC mainly originates loans to hold to maturity and in some cases (e.g. in underwriting) to sell or
sub-participate to other parties, resulting in a transfer of substantially all the risks and rewards, and
derecognition of the loan or portions of it. NIBC considers the activities of lending to hold and
lending to sell or sub-participate as two separate business models, with financial assets within the
former considered to be within a business model that has an objective to hold the assets to collect
contractual cash flows, and those within the latter included in a trading portfolio.
Loans originated under originate to manage contracts for third parties are not recognised by NIBC
after completion of their transfer.
NIBC decides to determine its business models at the combination of product and sector level, e.g.,
corporate loan facilities in the different sectors or residential mortgages in the Netherlands.
Contractual cash flow characteristics
In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, NIBC considers whether the contractual
terms of the financial asset contain a term that could change the timing or amount of contractual
cash flows arising over the life of the instrument, which could affect whether the instrument is
considered to meet the SPPI criteria.
The contractual provisions will pass the SPPI test as long as the interest/provisions reflects
consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the instrument during
the term of the instrument and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as profit.
A prepayment option which substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for the early
termination of the contract, would result in contractual cash flows that are SPPI on the principal
amount outstanding. This means that prepayment amounts will still meet the SPPI criteria even if it
includes what is deemed reasonable and market conform for early compensation.
All financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. In the case of financial instruments
subsequently measured at AC or FVOCI, the initial fair value is adjusted for directly attributable
transaction costs.
After initial recognition, NIBC classifies measures and presents its financial assets and financial
liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9 as described in the table on the following pages.

Derecognition, restructured and modified financial assets
When a counterparty is in financial difficulties or where default has already occurred, NIBC may
restructure financial assets by providing concessions that would otherwise not be considered and that
are outside of NIBC’s normal risk appetite, such as preferential interest rates, extension of maturity
and subordination. When a credit restructuring takes place, each case is considered individually and
the counterparty is classified as defaulted until the loan is collected or written off, non-preferential
conditions are granted that supersede the preferential conditions, or until the counterparty has
recovered and the preferential conditions no longer exceed NIBC’s risk appetite.
Concessions granted when there is no evidence of financial difficulties, or where changes to terms
and conditions are within NIBC’s usual risk appetite, are not considered to be a credit restructuring.
Modifications represent contract amendments that result in an alteration of future contractual cash
flows and that can occur within NIBC’s normal risk appetite or as part of a credit restructuring where
a counterparty is in financial difficulties.
NIBC derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions
have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference
recognised in the income statement. If the new discounted present value is at least 10% different and
greater than EUR 1 million from the original financial assets carrying value, NIBC considers the
132 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
modification as substantial. Qualitative thresholds to decide whether a modification is substantial are
change in currency or change in counterparty. Where the modification does not result in a
derecognition, any difference between the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original
EIR and the existing gross carrying value of a financial asset is recognised in profit or loss as a
modification gain or loss. Further, the subsequent SICR assessment is made by comparing the risk of
default at the reporting date based on the modified contractual terms of the financial asset with the
risk of default at initial recognition based on the original, unmodified contractual terms of the financial
asset.
Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the
cash flows from the assets have expired, or when they have been transferred and either (i) NIBC
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) NIBC neither transfers nor retains
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and NIBC has not retained control.
Fair value estimation
IFRS 13 requires for financial instruments and non-financial instruments that are measured at fair
value in the balance sheet disclosure of each class of financial assets and liabilities within a three-level
hierarchy, referring to the respective basis of fair value measurement as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
Determination of fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell or paid to transfer a
particular asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which NIBC has access at
that date. NIBC determines fair value either by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price
quotations without adjustment for transaction costs for those financial instruments that are currently
traded in an active market. The fair value measurement is based upon the bid price for financial assets
and the ask price for financial liabilities. These financial instruments are reported as level 1 in the fair
value hierarchy.
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and
regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s
length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive.
The fair value of financial instruments not quoted in an active market is determined using appropriate
valuation techniques. These valuation techniques are applied using, where possible, relevant market
observable inputs (level 2) or unobservable inputs (level 3). Valuation techniques include the
discounted cash flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which market observable prices
exist, option pricing models, credit models and other relevant models.
Certain financial instruments are recorded at fair value using valuation techniques in which current
market transactions or observable market data are not available. Their fair value is determined using a
valuation technique based on NIBC’s best estimate of the most appropriate assumptions and that has
been calibrated against actual market transactions. Outcomes are adjusted to reflect the spread for
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 133
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
bid and ask prices, to reflect costs to close out positions, where necessary for counterparty credit
and liquidity spread, and for any other limitations in the technique. Profit or loss, calculated upon
initial recognition (day one profit or loss), is deferred unless the calculation is based on market
observable inputs, in which case it is immediately recognised. Deferred day one profit or loss is
amortised to income over the contractual life until maturity or settlement.
The fair value of on demand deposits from customers is not less than the amount payable on
demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.
The level within the fair value hierarchy at which an instrument measured at fair value is categorised is
determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement of fair value
in its entirety.
NIBC recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred.
See note 47 for an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how
they are measured.
Recognition of day one profit or loss
The best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is the transaction price (that is, the fair value of
the consideration given or received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by
comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (that is,
without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only
data from observable markets.
NIBC has entered into transactions where fair value is determined using valuation models for which
not all inputs are market observable prices or rates. Such financial instruments are initially recognised
at the transaction price, which is the best indicator of fair value, although the value obtained from the
relevant valuation model may differ. Significant differences between the transaction price and the
model value, commonly referred to as day one profit or loss, are not recognised immediately in the
income statement.
Deferred day one profit or losses are amortised to income over the life until maturity or settlement.
The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value as determined by the relevant model
adjusted for any deferred day one profit or loss.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value
The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for
disclosure purposes of those financial instruments which are not recorded at fair value in the financial
statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying amount
For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than three months), it
is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate fair value. This assumption is also applied to
demand deposits from customers and customer savings with a specific maturity.
Fixed-rate financial instruments
The fair values of Fixed-rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by
comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates for
134 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
similar financial instruments. The estimated fair value of fixed-interest bearing deposits is based on
discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk
and maturity. For quoted debt issued, the fair values are determined based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model
is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity
and on credit spreads. For other variable rate instruments, an adjustment is also made to reflect the
change in required credit spread since initial recognition.
See note 47 for the fair values of NIBC’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the
balance sheet.
Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when,
and only when, NIBC has currently a legally enforceable right to set-off the amounts and the group
intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRS.
Collateral
NIBC enters into master agreements and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) with counterparties
whenever possible and when appropriate. Master agreements provide that, if the master agreement is
being terminated as a consequence of an event of default or termination event, all outstanding
transactions with the counterparty will fall due and all amounts outstanding will be settled on a net
basis. In the case of a CSA with counterparties, the group has the right to obtain collateral for the net
counterparty exposure.
NIBC obtains collateral in respect of counterparty liabilities when this is considered appropriate. The
collateral normally takes the form of a pledge over the counterparty’s assets and gives NIBC a claim
on these assets for both existing and future liabilities.
NIBC also pays and receives collateral in the form of cash or securities in respect of other credit
instruments, such as derivative contracts, in order to reduce credit risk. Collateral paid or received in
the form of cash together with the underlying is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Any
interest payable or receivable arising is recorded as interest expense or interest income respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
NIBC uses derivative financial instruments both for trading and hedging purposes. NIBC uses
derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks and
to credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured, and are subsequently re-measured, at fair value.
The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is obtained from quoted market prices. Fair values of
over-the-counter derivatives are obtained using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow
models and option pricing models.
The method of recognising fair value gains and losses depends on whether the derivatives are held
for trading or are designated as hedging instruments and if the latter, the nature of the risks being
hedged. All gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading are
recognised in the income statement in net trading income.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 135
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
When derivatives are designated as hedges, NIBC classifies them as either (i) a fair value hedge of
interest rate risk (‘portfolio fair value hedges’); (ii) a fair value hedge of interest rate risk or foreign
exchange rate risk (‘micro fair value hedges’) (iii) a cash flow hedge of the variability of highly
probable cash flows (‘cash flow hedges’) Hedge accounting is applied to derivatives designated as
hedging instruments, provided certain criteria are met.
Hedge accounting
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the criteria
specified in IAS 39, NIBC applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging
of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate, to the risks being hedged.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, NIBC documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking the
hedge. NIBC also requires a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing
basis, of whether or not the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in
offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.
Interest on designated qualifying hedges is included in net interest income.
NIBC discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
■ It is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
■ The derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised;
■ The hedged item matures, or is sold or repaid;
■ A forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable; or
■ It voluntarily decides to discontinue the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting and fair value hedge accounting on a micro level.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging
instruments are recorded in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to
the hedged risk.
If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative fair value
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over
the remaining period to maturity using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is
derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income
statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Portfolio fair value hedge
NIBC applies portfolio fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk arising on portfolios of
fixed-interest rate loans (classified as available for sale financial assets (until 31 December 2017) or as
amortised cost assets), to portfolios of plain vanilla fixed-interest rate funding (liabilities classified as
amortised cost) and to the residual interest rate risk from retail deposits and mortgages.
In order to apply portfolio fair value hedge accounting, the cash flows arising on the portfolios are
scheduled into time buckets based upon when the cash flows are expected to occur. For the first
two years, cash flows are scheduled using monthly time buckets; thereafter annual time buckets are
used. Hedging instruments are designated for each time bucket, together with an amount of assets or
liabilities that NIBC is seeking to hedge. Designation and de-designation of hedging relationships is
136 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
undertaken on a monthly basis, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging
relationship at a portfolio level, across all time buckets.
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item.
Micro fair value hedge
NIBC applies micro fair value hedge accounting to the interest rate risk and/or the foreign exchange
risk arising from debt investments at FVOCI (formerly available-for-sale) and fixed-interest rate
funding.
(Cross-currency) interest rate swaps are used as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the
income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the
hedged risks.
Effectiveness is tested retrospectively on a monthly basis by comparing the cumulative clean fair value
movement (since inception) of the hedged item, due to changes in both benchmark interest rates
and foreign exchange rates, to the total clean fair value movement of the hedging instrument (the
cumulative dollar offset method).
Ineffectiveness within the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised in the income statement through the
actual hedge adjustment. Ineffectiveness outside the 80% - 125% bandwidth is recognised by not
posting a hedge adjustment to the hedged item. In this case, the micro hedge relationship is de-
designated and it is re-designated at the beginning of the next period if expected to be highly
effective prospectively.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to hedge the variability arising on expected future cash flows
due to interest rate risk on loans at amortised cost and/or available for sale loans (until 31 December
2017) with floating interest rates. As interest rates fluctuate, the future cash flows on these
instruments also fluctuate. NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of such cash flow
fluctuations. Cash flow hedges are always on portfolio level.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and
qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income as net result of hedging
instruments. Any gain or loss in fair value relating to an ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the
periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When a hedging instrument
expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative
gain or loss in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income
until the forecast cash flow is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive
income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 137
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Hedge effectiveness testing
To qualify for hedge accounting, NIBC requires that at the inception of the hedge and throughout its
life, each hedge must be expected to be highly effective (prospective effectiveness). Actual
effectiveness (retrospective effectiveness) must also be demonstrated on an ongoing basis.
The documentation of each hedging relationship describes how effectiveness will be assessed. For
prospective effectiveness, the hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in achieving
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for
which the hedge is designated. For actual effectiveness, the changes in fair value or cash flows must
offset each other in the bandwidth of 80% - 125% for the hedge to be deemed effective.
Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the income statement in net income from assets and liabilities
at fair value through profit or loss.
Sale and repurchase transactions
Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (Repos) are reclassified in the financial statements as
pledged assets when the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or re-pledge the
collateral; the counterparty liability is included in amounts due to other banks or other deposits as
appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (Reverse repos) are recorded as loans and advances
to other banks or customers, as appropriate. The difference between sale and repurchase price is
treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
Expected credit losses (ECL)
NIBC recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured
at FVtPL:
■ financial assets that are debt instruments;
■ lease receivables;
■ financial guarantee contracts issued;
■ loan commitments issued.
No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments because they are classified at FVtPL.
Recognition of expected credit losses
ECL represents the difference between contractual cash flows and the actual cash flows NIBC
expects to receive, discounted at the EIR. For loan commitments and other credit facilities in scope of
ECL, expected cash shortfalls are determined by considering expected future drawdowns during the
contractual life of the instruments.
ECL are recognised on the following basis:
■ A maximum 12-month ECL are recognised from initial recognition, reflecting the portion of
lifetime cash shortfalls that would result if a default occurs in the 12 months after the reporting
date, weighted by the risk of a default occurring. Instruments in this category are referred to as
instruments in stage 1. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, ECL are
determined for this shorter period;
■ Lifetime ECL are recognised if a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) is detected subsequent to
the instrument’s initial recognition, reflecting lifetime cash shortfalls that would result from all
possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, weighted by the risk of a
138 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
default occurring. Instruments in this category are referred to as instruments in stage 2. The
moment SICR is no longer observed, the instrument moves back to stage 1.
■ Lifetime ECL are also recognised for credit-impaired financial instruments, referred to as
instruments in stage 3. The IFRS 9 determination of whether an instrument is credit-impaired is
based on the occurrence of one or more loss events with lifetime ECL derived by estimating
expected cash flows based on a chosen recovery strategy with additional consideration given to
forward-looking economic scenarios. Credit-impaired exposures may include positions for which
no loss has occurred or no allowance has been recognised, because they are expected to be fully
recoverable through the collateral held. For clarity and alignment the definition of credit-impaired,
stage 3 and defaulted were fully aligned. So a defaulted loan is by definition considered credit-
 impaired in the Capital Requirements Regulation in combination with further guidance and
clarification on this definition provided by European Banking Authority.
■ Changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are also recognised for assets that are purchased
or originated credit impaired financial assets (POCI). POCI are initially recognised at fair value with
interest income subsequently being recognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. POCI include
financial instruments that are newly recognised following a substantial restructuring and remain a
separate ECL-category until maturity.
NIBC applies the low credit risk exemption for part of the debt investments, being the liquidity
portfolio. NIBC considers a debt investment to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is
equivalent to the definition of 'investment grade'.
NIBC has a portfolio of lease receivables. NIBC elected to apply the general, not the simplified, ECL
approach for lease receivables.
ECL are recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding ECL allowance reported as a decrease in
the carrying value of financial assets measured at AC on the balance sheet. For financial assets
measured at FVOCI, the carrying value is not reduced, but an accumulated amount is recognised in
OCI.
For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines not recognised (i.e. related to
undrawn positions), provisions for ECL are reported in Provisions. ECL are recognised within the
income statement in Credit loss expense / recovery.
Default and credit impairment
A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of
the two following events have taken place:
1. NIBC considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by
NIBC to actions such as realising security (if held).
2. The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Group.
An instrument is classified as credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental
impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a
financial asset is credit-impaired include observable data about the following events:
1. significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the client;
2. a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
3. NIBC, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having
granted to the client a concession(s) that NIBC would not otherwise consider;
4. it is becoming probable that the client will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
5. the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 139
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6. the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit
losses.
Once a financial asset is classified as defaulted / credit-impaired (except POCIs), it remains as such
unless all past due amounts have been rectified, additional payments have been made on time, the
position is not classified as credit-restructured, and there is general evidence of credit recovery.
Write-off
A write-off is made when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven (e.g. in
cases of bankruptcy or distressed restructuring). Write-offs reduce the principal amount of a claim
and are charged against previously established allowances for credit losses. Recoveries, in part or in
full, of amounts previously written off are credited to Credit loss expense / recovery. Write-offs and
partial write-offs represent derecognition / partial derecognition events.
Measurement of ECL
NIBC calculates ECL's based on three probability-weighted scenarios (baseline, upturn and
downturn) to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at an approximation to the EIR. A
cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due to NIBC in accordance with the
contract and the cash flows that NIBC expects to receive.
The 12-month ECL (12M-ECL) and the Lifetime ECL (LT-ECL) represent the expected credit
losses that result from all possible default events over the next 12 months and the expected
remaining life of the instrument respectively. 12M-ECL and LT-ECL are calculated as a probability
weighted-average over the three macroeconomic scenarios and are based on the unbiased and
point-in-time estimates of Probability of Default (PIT-PD), Loss Given Default (PIT-LGD) and
Exposure at Default (PIT-EAD).
Credit losses and reversals are accounted for and disclosed separately from modification losses or
gains that are accounted for as an adjustment of the financial asset's gross carrying value.
The measurement of the ECL is summarised as follows:
140 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ECL Measurement
Stage 1 The 12M-ECL is calculated as the portion of LT-ECLs that represent the ECLs that result from
default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months or a shorter
period if applicable after the reporting date. NIBC calculates the 12M-ECL allowance based on
the expectation of a default occurring in the 12 months following the reporting date. These
expected 12-month default probabilities are applied to a forecast EAD and multiplied by the
expected LGD and discounted by an approximation to the original EIR.
Stage 2 When a loan has shown a SICR since origination, NIBC records an allowance for the LT-ECLs.
The mechanics are similar to those explained above, including the use of multiple scenarios, but
ECL calculations are summed over the lifetime of the instrument. The expected cash shortfalls
are discounted by an approximation to the original EIR. The EIR calculation for the corporate
exposures comprises of the current base rate plus an add-on. This rate is fixed to discount the
cash-flows over the remaining life of the loan until its legal maturity. This rate applies to all
financial instruments, including undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees. The EIR
calculation for retail mortgage loans is based on the current coupon rate. The rate is fixed over
the remaining life of the loan until its contractual maturity date.
Stage 3 For loans considered credit-impaired, NIBC recognises the LT-ECL, based on facility level
individual cash flow estimates determined by Restructuring & Distressed Assets (RDA). RDA
applies at least three scenarios (unless it is 100% impaired) and assigns probabilities to each of
these scenarios. Focus is on recovery of the client, while in parallel an enforcement strategy, a
loan trade or sale of the company are considered as alternative scenarios. The method is
conceptually similar to that for Stage 2 assets, but requires an individual assessment. For the
purpose of impairment calculation, the EIR is approximated by the sum of the applicable swap
curve plus the original contractual margin.
POCI POCI assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial recognition. NIBC only
recognises the cumulative changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition, based on a
probability-weighting of the three scenarios, discounted by the credit-adjusted EIR.
Loan When estimating LT-ECLs for undrawn loan commitments, NIBC estimates the expected
commitments portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its contractual life. The ECL is
and letters of then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash flows if the loan is drawn
credit down, based on a probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The expected cash shortfalls are
discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan. 
For loan commitments relating to revolving facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn
commitment, ECLs are calculated and presented together with the loan. For fully undrawn loan
commitments and letters of credit, the ECL is recognised within Provisions.
Financial NIBC's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially
guarantee recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the income statement, and the ECL
contracts provision. For this purpose, NIBC estimates ECLs based on the present value of the expected
payments to reimburse the holder for a credit loss that it incurs. The calculation is made using a
probability-weighting of the three scenarios. The ECLs related to financial guarantee contracts
are recognised within Provisions.
Both 12M-ECL and LT-ECL are calculated on an individual basis.
Movements of the financial instruments between the different stages due to changed credit risk
profiles are disclosed in the movement schedules in the notes to these consolidated financial
statements. Movements between changes or credit loss allowances, caused by eventual changes in the
models or in the input parameters used, are disclosed as separate items in these movement
schedules.
Scenarios and scenario weights
The determination of the probability weighted ECL requires evaluating a range of relevant future
economic conditions. To accommodate this requirement, NIBC uses three different macroeconomic
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 141
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
scenarios in the ECL calculation: a baseline, an upturn and a downturn scenario. Each scenario is
represented by a specific scenario narrative, scenario probability and a set of macroeconomic factors.
A weight is computed for each scenario by using a probabilistic econometric model that considers
recent information as well as several decades of historical data. The determined weights constitute
the probabilities that the respective macroeconomic developments will occur. The scenarios, including
the narratives, the macroeconomic forecasts and the scenario weights, are further discussed,
challenged and potentially refined by a team of NIBC-internal experts. The baseline scenario is
aligned to the economic and market assumptions used for NIBC business planning purposes.
Economic scenarios and weights applied
ECL scenario Assigned weights in %
Upturn 30.0
Baseline 32.5
Downturn 37.5
Macro-economic and other factors
The range of macroeconomic, market and other factors that is modelled as part of the scenario
determination is wide, and historical information is used to support the identification of the key
factors. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of information decreases and judgment
increases. The macroeconomic forecast has an influence on PDs only during the first 5 years. During
years 6-10 the model applies reversion to the mean (i.e. the Point-in-Time (PiT) PD converges with
the Through-the-Cycle (TTC) PD) and after year 11 the PDs are influenced only by the TTC matrix.
The forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions used in the ECL calculation are derived from
Moody’s Data Buffet. NIBC has identified different segments to allow for specific risks and forecasts
to be incorporated in the macroeconomic scenarios. The segments include:
■ Corporate General;
■ Corporate Offshore Energy;
■ Corporate Shipping; and
■ Retail.

Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)
Financial instruments subject to ECL are monitored on an ongoing basis which includes an assessment
whether SICR has occurred. The assessment criteria include both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Qualitative factors are forbearance measures, Watch List and/or managed by RDA and the
quantitative factor is increase in PD since initial recognition.

agreeing an amendment (restructuring) a longer probation period applies of at least one year. The
forbearance probation period is two years.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life and goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (Cash-Generating Units - CGUs). Non-financial assets, other than
goodwill that suffered an impairment, are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
reporting date. Impairment losses and the reversal of such losses, for non-financial assets other than
goodwill, are recognised directly in the income statement.
There were no impairments on non-financial assets in the years 2018 and 2017.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 143
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of NIBC’s share of the
net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on
acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is
included in investments in associates. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently
when there are indications that impairment may have occurred and carried at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the
goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment.
Trademarks and licences
Separately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and licences
acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks
and licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademarks and
licences over their estimated useful lives of ten years.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three
years.
Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost
less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
expected life of the customer relationship.
Impairment of intangible assets
At each reporting date, NIBC assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable (see impairment – non-financial assets).
Tangible assets
Property (land and buildings) and equipment
Land and buildings comprise offices and are measured at fair value (revaluation model). This fair value
is based on the most recent appraisals by independent registered appraisers, less straight-line
depreciation for buildings over the estimated economic life taking into account any residual value.
Buildings in own use are valued at market value on an unlet or let basis. If arm’s length lease
agreements have been concluded between NIBC group companies, the building is recognised at its
value as a let property. If there is no lease agreement, the property is recognised as vacant property.
Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the carrying amount of
the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property,
plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
144 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising from revaluation of land and buildings are credited to other
reserves in shareholder’s equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are
charged against other reserves directly in other comprehensive income; all other decreases are
charged to the income statement. Each year, the difference between depreciation based on the re-
valued carrying amount of the asset charged to the income statement and depreciation based on the
asset’s original cost is transferred from other reserves to retained earnings.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to
allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as
follows:
Depreciation
Buildings 30 - 50 years
Machinery 4 - 10 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 - 10 years
Assets under operating leases 1 - 5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting
date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount
and are recognised within other operating income. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts
included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Investment property
Investment property is property (land or a building - or part of a building - or both) held to earn
rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or
services, for administrative purposes or sale in the ordinary course of business.
Investment property is initially measured at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change
therein recognised in the income statement.
Where the group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s length transaction, the carrying value
immediately prior to the sale is adjusted to the transaction price, and the adjustment is recorded in
the income statement within net gain from fair value adjustment on investment property.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement at inception date.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 145
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A group company is the lessee
Operational lease
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another
party, the lessor, are classified as operating leases. Payments, including prepayments, made under
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to income statement on
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Properties leased out under operating leases are
included in investment properties.
Financial lease
Leases of assets where the group has substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair
value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease
payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included
in other liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period. The investment properties acquired under finance leases are measured
subsequently at their fair value.
The leases entered into by the group are primarily operational leases. The total payments made
under operating leases are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. When an operational lease is terminated before the
lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is
recognised as an expense in the period in which termination takes place.
A group company is the lessor
When assets are held subject to a financial lease, the present value of the lease payments is
recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the
receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of
the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of
return. When assets are held subject to an operating lease, the assets are included in Assets held
under operating leases under Property, plant and equipment.
Financial guarantees
In the ordinary course of business, NIBC issues financial guarantees, consisting of letters of credit,
guarantees and acceptances. Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements
(within ‘other liabilities’) at fair value, being the premium received and subsequently measured at the
higher of the amount of the loss allowance; and the premium received on initial recognition less
income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15. Any increase in the liability relating to
financial guarantees is recorded in the income statement in credit loss expenses. The premium
received is recognised in the income statement in fee and commission income on a straight line basis
over the life of the guarantee.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with
less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, including cash and non-restricted
balances with central banks and net credit balances on current accounts with other banks.
Cash balances are measured at face value while bank balances are measured at cost.
146 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is
considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,
financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under
insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset in the scope of
IFRS 15 (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent
increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the
date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of
derecognition.
Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or
amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for
sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal
group classified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as
held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,
is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a
subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are
presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, if material, the comparative income
statement and cash flow statement are represented as if the operation had been discontinued from
the start of the comparative period.
Provisions
Provisions contains:
■ ECL allowances for off-balance sheet financial instruments;
■ Restructuring and/or reorganisation provisions;
■ Employee benefits;
■ Other provisions.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in
settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised
even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of
obligations may be remote.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected required expenditure to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is
recognised as interest expense. Provisions are presented under other liabilities.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 147
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contingent liabilities, if applicable, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed,
unless they are remote.
ECL allowances for off-balance sheet financial instruments
For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines not recognised (i.e. related to
undrawn positions), provisions for ECL are reported in Provisions. ECL are recognised within the
income statement in Credit loss expense / recovery.
Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when:
■ The group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;
■ It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation;
■ The amount has been reliably estimated.
A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when the group has a detailed formal plan for the
restructuring identifying at least:
■ the business or part of a business concerned;
■ the principal locations affected;
■ the location, function, and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for
terminating their services;
■ the expenditures that will be undertaken;
■ when the plan will be implemented; and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will
carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to
those affected by it.
The group does not recognise provisions for projected future operating losses.
Employee benefits
Pension benefits
NIBC operates a defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable to a defined
contribution plan is in proportion to the services rendered to NIBC by the employees and is
recorded as an expense under personnel expenses and share-based payments. Unpaid contributions
are recorded as a liability. NIBC does not operate a defined benefit plan.
Termination benefits
NIBC recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group can no
longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In
the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured
based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12
months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
Share-based compensation
NIBC operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
Equity-settled transactions
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, under which the
entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (shares or options) of
the group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or
148 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to
the fair value of the shares or options granted:
■ Including any market performance conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions;
■ Excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares or options
that are expected to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the
period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each
reporting period, NIBC revises its estimates of the number of shares or options that are expected to
vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. NIBC recognises the impact of the revision to
original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is
conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the
market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied. Similarly, awards
of equity instruments with non-vesting conditions are treated as vesting if all vesting conditions that
are not market conditions are met, irrespective of whether the non-vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised in
personnel expenses is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. An additional expense is
recognised for any modification which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment
arrangement or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation,
and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award
where non-vesting conditions within the control of either NIBC or the counterparty are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a
modification of the original award.
Cash-settled transactions
For the cash-settled share-based compensation plan, the fair value of the employee services received
in exchange for the grant of share-based compensation is recognised as a liability. The liability is re-
measured at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date with changes in fair value
recognised in the income statement in personnel expenses. The social security contributions payable
in connection with the grant of the share options are considered an integral part of the grant itself,
and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
A liability is recognised for cash-settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into
consideration the profit attributable to our shareholder after certain adjustments. NIBC recognises a
liability where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive
obligation.
Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 149
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
shareholder’s equity (other comprehensive income), in which case it is recognised in shareholder’s
equity (other comprehensive income).
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using tax
rates (and laws) enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when NIBC intends to
settle on a net basis and a legal right of offset exists.
Deferred income tax is provided for in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred
income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
NIBC’s principal temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and
liabilities including derivative contracts, the depreciation of property and tax losses carried forward
and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired
and their tax base.
Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries
and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry-forward are recognised as an asset when it is
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax related to the fair value remeasurement of available for sale investments and cash flow
hedges, which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, is also credited or
charged directly to other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognised in the income
statement when the deferred gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Equity
Share capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is not a contractual obligation to transfer cash or other
financial assets.
Capital securities
As there is no formal obligation to (re)pay the principal or to pay a dividend the capital securities are
recognised as equity and dividends paid on capital securities are recognised directly in equity.
150 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Issue costs of shares and capital securities
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities
Dividends on ordinary shares and capital securities are recognised as a liability in the period that the
obligation for payment has been established, being in the period in which they are approved by the
shareholder.
Revenue recognition
As detailed in the sub-sections below, NIBC recognises the revenue on financial instruments in:
■ net interest income;
■ investment income;
■ net trading income;
■ net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL;
■ net gains or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC
in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (until 31 December 2017 IAS 39 Financial
Instruments).
In accordance with IAS 17 Leases, revenue from finance lease contracts are included in interest
income and revenue from operating lease contracts in other operating income.
NIBC recognises revenue in relation to:
■ net fee and commission income;
■ other operating income,
in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when (or as) a performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised service (ie an asset) to a customer. An asset is
transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods
and services in the ordinary course of NIBC’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value added tax,
returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within NIBC.
Net interest income
Interest income and expense from financial instruments measured at AC and FVOCI are recognised
in the income statement applying the EIR method. In determining interest income and expense, the
EIR is applied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (unless the asset is credit-impaired)
or the AC of a financial liability, based on estimated future cash flows that take into account all
contractual cash flows. However, when a financial asset becomes credit-impaired after initial
recognition, interest income is determined by applying EIR to the net carrying amount of the
instrument. Furthermore, for financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest
is determined by applying a credit-adjusted EIR to the AC of the instrument.
Penalty interest is directly recognised under interest income in case of early redemption ((partly)
derecognition of the related financial instrument). Penalty interest is directly recognised under interest
income in case of an interest reset.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 151
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Interest income from financial assets measured at FVtPL is recognised applying the contractual
interest rates. Deviations between the contractual interest rates and the prevailing market rates of
interest for a similar instrument (e.g. caused by performance related fees) are recognised in Net gains
or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL.
Interest income on financial instruments measured at AC and financial assets measured at FVOCI are
presented separately within Interest income from financial instruments measured at AC and FVOCI and
Interest expense from financial instruments measured at AC, with interest on financial instruments at
FVtPL presented in Interest income (or expense) from financial instruments measured at FVtPL.
Net fee and commission income
NIBC earns fee income from a diverse range of services it provides to its clients. Fee income can be
divided into two broad categories:
■ fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time, such as (originate to
manage) asset or investment management,
■ fees earned from point in time services such as underwriting and brokerage fees, structuring – and
advisory fees, and performance linked fees from investment management activities.
Over time services
Fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time are recognised ratably over
the service period provided the fees are not contingent on successfully meeting specified
performance criteria that are beyond the control of NIBC (see measurement below).
Costs to fulfil over time services are recorded in the income statement immediately because such
services are considered to be a series of services that are substantially the same from day to day and
have the same pattern of transfer.
Point in time services
Fees earned from providing transaction-type services are recognised when the service has been
completed provided such fees are not highly probable subject to refund or another contingency
beyond the control of NIBC.
Measurement
Fee and commission income is measured based on consideration specified in a legally enforceable
contract with a customer, excluding amounts such as taxes collected on behalf of third parties.
Consideration can include both fixed and variable amounts. Variable consideration includes refunds,
discounts, performance bonuses and other amounts that are contingent on the occurrence or non-
occurrence of a future event. Variable consideration that is contingent on an uncertain event can only
be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of
cumulative revenue for a contract will not occur.
In the following table the recognition of revenue under IFRS 15 per main fee revenue earned by
NIBC is listed.

Presentation of fee and commission income and expense
Fee and commission income and expense are presented gross on the face of the income statement.
Investment income
Investment income includes the following income items:
Gains less losses from financial assets
Realised gains or losses from debt investments and equity investments previously recognised in other
comprehensive income, and gains or losses from associates and equity investments at fair value
through profit or loss and impairment losses on equity investments are recognised in the income
statement as gains less losses from financial assets.
Dividend income
Dividends are recognised in the income statement when NIBC’s right to receive payment is
established.
Share in result of associates (equity method)
Share in result of associates includes gains and losses related to investments in associates (equity
method).
Net trading income
At the introduction of IFRS 9 NIBC decided to alter the presentation of net trading income
classification. Net trading income is split into two new income lines in the face of the income
statement;
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 153
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ Net trading income (only trading book related Net trading income) and
■ Net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
For comparison purposes, the 2017 figures are also presented using the new income structure.
Net trading income comprises:
■ all gains and losses from financial assets held for trading, as well as
■ realised gains and losses on financial liabilities held for trading, and
■ foreign exchange gains and losses.
Net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL.
Net gains or (losses) from assets and liabilities at FVtPL comprises
■ all gains and losses from financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit
or loss,
■ excluding those presented under
■ investment income,
■ net trading income, and
■ other comprehensive income (the results from movements in the fair value of financial liabilities
that are attributable to changes in NIBC Holding’s own credit risk).
Net gain or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC
The line item Net gain or (losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at AC includes the
differences between the carrying value just before derecognition and total consideration received at
the sale of a financial asset measured at AC.
Rental income
The group manages a portfolio of German Residential and Commercial Property. Rental income from
operating leases from the German Residential and Commercial Property is recognised in income on
a straight line basis over the lease term net of discounts and other deductions.
Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculation, gives details of the source
of cash and cash equivalents that became available during the year and the application of these cash
and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from
operating activities, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities.
Movements in loans and receivables and inter-bank deposits are included in the cash flow from
operating activities. Investing activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect
of financial investments, as well as investments in and sales of subsidiaries and associates, property,
plant and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are
treated as financing activities. Movements due to currency translation differences as well as the effects
of the consolidation of acquisitions, where of material significance, are eliminated from the cash flow
figures.
Fiduciary activities
NIBC acts in fiduciary activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals,
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. The assets are excluded from these financial
statements as they are not assets of the group. Related fee and commission income arising thereon is
recognised under fee and commission income.
154 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
NIBC Holding makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances.
Estimates and judgements are principally made in the following areas:
■ Fair value of certain financial instruments;
■ Expected credit losses of financial instruments not measured at FVtPL;
■ Income taxes, and
■ Consolidation of structured entities.
Fair value of certain financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on quoted market prices in an active
market or, where no active market exists, by using valuation techniques. In cases where valuation
techniques are used, the fair values are estimated from market observable data, if available, or by
using models. Where market-observable inputs are not available, they are estimated based on
appropriate assumptions.
Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically
reviewed by qualified personnel independent of those who prepared them. All models are reviewed
prior to use and models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative
market prices. To the extent possible, models use only observable data; however, in areas such as
applicable credit spreads (both own credit spread and counterparty credit spreads), volatilities and
correlations may require management to estimate inputs.
Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. For the
identification of assumptions used in the determination of fair value of financial instruments and for
estimated sensitivity information for level 3 financial instruments, except for own liabilities (see note
47).
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of these liabilities was estimated to be EUR 483 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 821 million). This portfolio is designated at fair value through profit or loss
and is reported on the face of the balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Own debt securities in issue;
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Debt securities in issue structured;
■ Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: Subordinated liabilities.
The portion of fair value changes on these liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss
during 2018 attributable to the movement in credit spreads as reported in notes 37, 38 and 43
reflects gross amounts, excluding pull-to-par and model refinement effects.
The bank estimates its own credit risk from market observable data such as NIBC senior unsecured
issues, NIBC subordinated issues and secondary prices for its traded debt.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 155
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The valuation of all the above classes of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or
loss is sensitive to the estimated credit spread used to discount future expected cash flows. A 10
basis point change in the weighted average credit spread used to discount future expected cash flows
would increase or decrease the fair value of these own financial liabilities at 31 December 2018 by
EUR 2 million (31 December 2017: EUR 3 million).
Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit valuation adjustment and debit valuation
adjustment)
Credit Valuation Adjustments & Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVAs and DVAs) are incorporated into
derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of respectively the counterparty and NIBC. In
essence, CVA represents an estimate of the discounted expected loss on an Over The Counter (OTC)
derivative during the lifetime of a contract. DVA represents the estimate of the discounted expected
loss from the counterparty’s perspective. Both CVA and DVAs are applied to all OTC derivative
contracts, except those that benefit from a strong collateral agreement where cash collateral is
regularly exchanged, mitigating credit risk.
Fair value of equity investments
The group estimates the fair value of its equity investments using valuation models, and it applies the
valuation principles set forth by the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation
Guidelines to the extent that these are consistent with IFRS 9.
On 31 December 2018, the fair value of this portfolio was estimated to be EUR 187 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 323 million). This portfolio is reported as equity investments (including
investments in associates) at fair value through profit or loss (31 December 2018: EUR 187 million;
31 December 2017: EUR 287 million) and until 31 December 2017 under IAS 39 as equity
investments at available for sale (31 December 2017: EUR 36 million).
For the determination of the fair value of equity investments and for estimated sensitivity to key
assumptions in the valuation, see note 47.
Expected credit losses (ECL) of financial instruments not measured at
FVtPL
The calculation of ECL requires management to apply significant judgment and make estimates and
assumptions that involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. Changes to these
estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be
recognised. Reference is made to the corresponding notes for the nature and carrying amounts of
the ECL of financial instruments not measured at FVtPL.
Determination of a significant increase of credit risk (SICR)
IFRS 9 does not include a definition of what constitutes SICR. NIBC assesses whether an SICR has
occurred since initial recognition based on qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable
forward-looking information that includes significant management judgment. More stringent criteria
could significantly increase the number of instruments migrating to stage 2.
Scenarios, scenario weights and macroeconomic factors
ECL reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount, which NIBC determines by evaluating a
range of possible outcomes. Management selects forward-looking scenarios and judges the suitability
156 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of respective weights to be applied. Changes in the scenarios and weights, the corresponding set of
macroeconomic variables and the assumptions made around those variables for the forecast horizon
would have a significant effect on the ECL.
The macroeconomic projections in the baseline scenario are the most important determinant of the
final ECL amount. The combined impact of MES, applied to the corporate loan and mortgage loan
portfolios, on the ECL is limited (1% of Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL).
ECL measurement period
Lifetime ECL are determined based upon the contractual maturity of the transaction (other than
revolving facilities), which significantly affects ECL. The ECL calculation is therefore sensitive to any
extension of contractual maturities triggered by business decisions, consumer behaviour and an
increased number of stage 2 positions.
Modelling and management adjustments
A number of complex models have been developed or modified to calculate ECL. Internal
counterparty rating changes, new or revised models and data may significantly affect ECL.
Management adjustments, based on counterparty details, can be applicable to resolve technical issues
in the processing of stage 1 and stage 2 ECL. The models are governed by NIBC’s risk department,
which aims to ensure independent verification.
Changes to the assumptions in the models are subject to approval by the Risk Management
Committee (RMC) or ALCO of NIBC.
Income taxes
Deferred tax assets are included only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near
future against which these temporary differences can be offset. When determining future taxable
profits, estimates are used since these are subject to uncertainty. If an amount of EUR 10 million less
or more future taxable profits can be offset against unused carry forward losses within the term to
maturity of these carry forward losses, that varies between two and nine years, an additional tax loss
or gain should be recognised in the profit or loss of EUR 2.5 million at the currently applicable
income tax rate of 25%.
Consolidation of structured entities
The consolidation of structured entities is a critical estimate that requires judgement and is described
in note 59.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Segment report
Segment information is presented in these consolidated financial statements on the same basis as
used for internal management reporting within NIBC. Segment reporting puts forth a presentation of
the segment results based on management reporting methods and a reconciliation between the
results of the operating segments and the consolidated financial statements. The Managing Board is
the Group's chief operating decision-maker.
Operating segments
Taking into account the changes, the operating segments are as follows:
Corporate client offering
Corporate client offering provides advice and debt, mezzanine and equity financing solutions to mid-
sized companies and entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Sectors in which we
are active include Commercial Real Estate, Food, Agriculture, Retail & Health, Infrastructure &
Renewables, Industries & Manufacturing, Telecom, Media, Technology & Services. Furthermore, we
are active in two global sectors in which we have longstanding expertise: Offshore Energy and
Shipping & Intermodal. This segment also includes NIBC Markets.
Retail client offering
Retail client offering offers savings products and mortgages to consumers who are seeking to actively
manage their financial objectives. Savings products are offered in the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium, and mortgages are offered in the Netherlands. We also offer brokerage services in Germany
under our label 'NIBC Direct.'
Treasury and Group Functions
Treasury and Group functions includes the bank's treasury function, asset and liability management,
risk management and the bank's Corporate Centre which includes HR & Corporate
Communications, Internal Audit, Legal & Compliance, Sustainability, Operations & Facilities,
Technology, and Finance, Tax & Strategy. A substantial part of the operating expenses as well as the
full time equivalents of Group Functions are allocated to corporate and retail client offering.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above-mentioned segments. Transfer
prices between operating segments are at an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions
with third parties.
Certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to Corporate client offering and Retail client
offering as they are managed on a group basis. These financial assets and liabilities are held within the
segment Treasury and Group Functions and mainly comprise cash, debt investments, derivative assets
and liabilities as well as majority of the bank's funding. As the assets of Corporate Banking and Retail
Banking are largely funded internally with transfer pricing, majority of NIBC's external funding is held
within Treasury and Group Functions.
Inter-segment income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation level.
Reconciliation with consolidated income statement
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in our Accounting Policies
section.

164 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The changes in 2018 net interest income compared to 2017 mainly relate to the following
developments:
■ With the reclassification of the fair value mortgage portfolio to amortised cost, as part of the
implementation of IFRS 9, the interest income of this portfolio is now included in the interest
income from financial instruments measured at amortised cost;
■ In 2017, the existing hedging portfolio of the fair value mortgage portfolio (with relatively high
interest rates) has been unwound and replaced with new swaps at current (low) interest rates, a.o.
to prepare for hedge accounting after implementation of IFRS 9. As a consequence, the interest
expenses related to these derivatives (net between the pay and receive leg) has decreased, which
is presented in interest income for financial instruments at amortised cost. This has increased net
interest income by EUR 28 million;
■ The average funding costs have decreased, leading to lower interest expenses. The effect has
impacted the interest expense from financial instruments measured at amortised cost and as well
as financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Interest income includes negative interest from liabilities for an amount of EUR 28 million (2017:
EUR 35 million).
For the year ended 31 December 2018, interest expense related to deposits from customers
amounted to EUR 88 million (31 December 2017: EUR 113 million).
Interest expense includes negative interest from financial assets for an amount of EUR 76 million
(2017: EUR 62 million).

explained by an increased portfolio under management.

loss of EUR 5 million in 2017.
Interest rate instruments (economic hedge) resulted in a loss of EUR 1 million (2017: a loss of
EUR 4 million), mainly related to CVA adjustments and the accounting mismatch between economic
hedges of the underlying exposures.
Loans report a loss of EUR 5 million, which includes a credit loss of EUR 3 million, in addition to fair
value movements.
As the mortgage portfolio and the debt investments have been reclassified from fair value through
profit or loss to amortised cost, these items equal nil in 2018.
Debt securities report a gain of EUR 1 million, related to repurchased securities.

Depositary receipts
The Depositary Receipts (DRs), consisting of CDRs and RDRs, are issued by Stichting
Administratiekantoor NIBC (the Foundation) in accordance with its relevant conditions of
administration (administratievoorwaarden). Prior to the IPO the conditions of administration have
been slightly adjusted to declare a generic lock-up period of six months for holders of DRs. The
generic lock-up period of six months ended on 23 September 2018 (i.e. six months after the IPO).
The Foundation issues a DR for each ordinary share it holds in NIBC Holding. The Foundation
exercises the voting rights in respect of each of these ordinary shares at its own discretion, while the
holder of a DR is entitled to the dividends and other distributions declared payable in respect of the
underlying ordinary share. Holders of DRs cannot exercise voting rights or request a power of
attorney from the Foundation to vote in respect of our ordinary shares.
Under the conditions of administration, the holders of DRs have pre-emption rights similar to other
shareholders of NIBC Holding, subject to the Foundation having been given pre-emptive rights.
Consequently, when given these pre-emptive rights, the Foundation will exercise the pre-emption
rights attached to the ordinary shares underlying the DRs if these holders so elect.
In 2009 a co-investment programme was introduced for Statutory Board members. Under this
programme Statutory Board members were granted matching shares (CRDRs), subject to a four-year
vesting period, on a net after-tax basis representing a 1:1 match to their personal investment in CDRs
at that time. These matching shares will become fully unconditional and vest immediately upon
change of control of NIBC Holding. NIBC Holding has the discretion to offer new members of the
Statutory Board the opportunity to participate in this co-investment programme under the same
conditions, except for the ability to earn performance shares as this feature is presumed no longer to
be in line with the DNB Principles.
In December 2017 it was proposed by the Statutory Board and subsequently approved by the
Remuneration and Nominating Committee and Supervisory Board to change the Plan Rules Variable
Compensation (NIBC Choice) in order to allow delivery of DRs for outstanding CCDRs in lieu of the
occurrence of a change of control of NIBC Holding. Furthermore it was decided that all unvested
CRDRs outstanding at 1 January 2018 will vest immediately (accelerated vesting) into CCDRs. This
applied to 3.558 CRDRs (net after tax basis) related to the cancellation of the Long Term Incentive

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
arrangement for certain Statutory Board members. Following this change of the Plan Rules 317,200
(net after tax basis) outstanding CCDRs were released into CDRs in January 2018.
As of 1 January 2015 a short-term variable income component at target of 15% of base salary (with
a maximum of 20%) is applicable for Statutory Board members. The variable compensation is
delivered in a pre-defined mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in PSUs and 20% in RPSUs.
One-off retention package ExCo members
On 23 March 2018, the date of the IPO, NIBC granted a retention package of DRs to the members
of the ExCo. For Statutory Board members of the ExCo, the monetary value of the retention
package will be set at 180 per cent of their fixed annual gross salary. The fixed annual gross salary is
EUR 825,000 for the CEO and EUR 600,000 for each of the CFO and CRO, therefore the gross
monetary value of the retention package is EUR 1,485,000 for the CEO and EUR 1,080,000 for each
of the CFO and CRO. For non-statutory members of the ExCo, the monetary value of the retention
package set at 165 per cent of their fixed annual gross salary. The fixed annual gross salary for each
of the non-statutory members of the ExCo is EUR 350,000 and therefore the gross monetary value
of the retention package EUR 577,500.
Under the one-off retention package, DRs were granted and will be vested in accordance to a
predefined vesting schedule.
The number of DRs is calculated by converting the gross monetary amount of the retention package
into the number of DRs corresponding to ordinary shares at the initial offering price of EUR 8.75.
The number of DRs to be issued pursuant to the retention package awarded at the first anniversary
of the IPO date shall be calculated by converting the gross monetary amount of the retention
package into the number of DRs corresponding to the ordinary shares at the share price of the
ordinary shares at 23 March 2019. In addition, for a period of five years from the date of award,
being either the IPO date or the first anniversary thereof, the members of the ExCo may not dispose
of any DRs received pursuant to the retention package. The lock-up period cannot be waived and
the retention package arrangement does not provide for any circumstances which may result in
automatic waiver of the lock-up period. Following the expiry of the applicable lock-up period, the
ExCo member (i) may request the Foundation to convert the DRs into ordinary shares and transfer
the ordinary shares to a third party investment account; or (iii) may offer all or part of their entire
holding of DRs for sale to the Foundation against cancellation of such DRs with the sale being settled
in cash and the value of the cash payments being calculated by multiplying the number of DRs
cancelled by the price of one ordinary share on Euronext Amsterdam as at the date of cancellation.
After the lock-up period of five years, the underlying shares of the DRs will be delivered by the STAK
to the personal securities accounts of the ExCo members or the underlying shares of the DRs will be
sold on the stock exchange on behalf of the respective ExCo member.
The retention package is subject to the holdback and claw back provisions as set out in the
remuneration policy of NIBC and as set out in article 2:135 of the Dutch Civil Code and article 1:126
and 1:127 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.
Depositary Receipts Purchase Plan (DRPP)
In view of the IPO at 23 March 2018, all employees of NIBC (including members of Statutory Board
and other members of the Executive Committee) were offered to participate in the DRPP to
purchase CDRs in NIBC Holding.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 171
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The ExCo and staff members of NIBC are entitled to a tax discount between 5.5 per cent and 18.5
per cent on the initial offering price at 23 March 2018, corresponding with a lock-up period for
disposal between one and five years. The related tax expense of EUR 1.0 million is borne by NIBC.
Phantom Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Phantom Share Units (RPSUs)
The short-term compensation in share-related awards consists of PSUs and/or RPSUs. RPSU awards
are subject to a three-year vesting with one third vesting each year on 1 April. All PSUs and RPSUs
are subject to a one-year retention period as measured from the date of vesting. For the Statutory
Board the lock-up period of the equity-linked instruments is five years. The RPSU and PSU has similar
characteristics as the CRDR, such as eligibility for dividend and a value which is tied to movements in
the net asset value of NIBC Holding, however RPSUs are not eligible for dividend. After IPO the fair
value is based on the listed share price of NIBC Holding. This short-term compensation can be
converted into cash immediately after the retention period and therefore is recognised as cash-
settled.

Result recognition
With respect to all instruments relating to NIBC Choice (CDRs, CCDRs, CRDRs, PSUs, RPSUs and
deferred cash), an amount of EUR 8 million was expensed through personnel expenses in 2018
(2017: EUR 3 million), of which EUR 2 million (2017: EUR 3 million) refers to cash-settled
instruments (deferred cash and vested PSUs) and 6 million (2017: nil) to equity-settled instruments
(including fiscal discount borne by NIBC related to one-off retention package and DRPP).
With respect to the cash-settled instruments (PSUs, RPSUs and deferred cash), the amount
expensed during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of
instruments originally granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at balance sheet date,
the vesting period and estimates of the number of instruments that will forfeit during the remaining
vesting period. The liability in the balance sheet with respect to cash-settled instruments is
EUR 5 million (2017: EUR 5 million).
174 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
With respect to the equity-settled instruments (CDRs, CCDRs and CRDRs), the amount expensed
during the vesting period through the income statement is based on the number of instruments
granted outstanding at balance sheet date, their fair value at grant date, the vesting period and
estimates of the number of instruments that will forfeit during the remaining vesting period. The
liability in the balance sheet relating to the cumulative expenses with respect to equity-settled
instruments is EUR 2 million (2017: EUR 4 million).
The current account position with NIBC Holding includes a receivable related to the capital
contribution received from NIBC Holding in relation to the granted equity settled NIBC Holding
share-based instruments (NIBC Choice) by NIBC. The share-based expenses are borne by NIBC and
the after payroll tax amounts were paid to the Foundation with subsequent delivery of CDRs and/or

The changes in fair value in the previous table reflect movements due to both interest rate changes
and credit spread changes. As NIBC hedges its interest rate risk from these assets, the movement
due to interest rate changes is compensated by results on financial derivatives.
The cumulative change in fair value included in the balance amount (at fair value through profit or
loss) attributable to changes in interest rates and credit risk amounts to a loss of EUR 21 million
(2017: EUR 8 million).
The portion of fair value changes in 2018 included in the balance sheet amount (at fair value through
profit or loss) as at 31 December 2018 relating to the movement in credit spreads amounted to nil
(2017: nil).
The maximum credit risk exposure including undrawn credit facilities amounted to EUR 187 million
(2017: EUR 181 million).
The maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account of any collateral or other credit
enhancement for this financial asset amounts to EUR 187 million as per 31 December 2018 (2017:
EUR 181 million). This credit risk exposure is mitigated by the collateral held as security and other
credit enhancements on these assets, for which the fair value amounts as per 31 December 2018 to
EUR 148 million (2017: EUR 181 million).

Derivative financial assets and liabilities used for hedge accounting are derivatives designated in hedge
accounting relationships as defined in IAS 39.
The derivatives financial assets and liabilities in the category 'other' are classified as held for trading
according to IAS 39.
The derivatives in this category consist of:
■ Interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of the mortgage portfolio;
■ Interest rate swaps to transform fixed rate funding into floating rate funding;
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 183
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ FX and cross-currency swaps to fund the non-euro loans to customers or to transform non-euro
funding into euros;
■ Client-driven derivative transactions and hedges resulting from this activity;
■ Limited money market trading.
Economically all these derivatives, with the exception of the limited money market trading, are used
to hedge interest rate or FX risk. The limited money market trading is controlled by a small facilitating
VAR limit of EUR 2.25 million. For further details see note 59 Market risk (Key risk statistics Trading
portfolio excluding NIBC Markets).
Sources of ineffectiveness are the behavior of the curve shift, the volatility of the basis spread over
the curve and the distribution of cash flows of assets and liabilities compared to the hedging
derivatives.

Portfolio fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC
uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To
mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate
plain vanilla funding and corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2018 was EUR 7 million debit (2017: EUR 16 million debit). The losses
on the hedging instruments were EUR 1 million (2017: EUR 2 million). The gains on the hedged
items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 1 million (2017: EUR 3 million). Differences between
the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by hedge
ineffectiveness.
Portfolio fair value hedge of Assets & Liabilities
According to NIBC's Hedging Policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its fixed
rate asset and liability activities such as mortgages and retail deposits above certain limits prescribed
by the ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk
arising on these primairly fixed rate mortgages and retail deposits. To mitigate any accounting
mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the assets and liabilities with a
contractual duration longer than three months and the corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2018 was EUR 1 million debit (2017: EUR 29 million credit). The losses
on the hedging instruments were EUR 34 million (2017: gain of EUR 35 million). The gains on the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 41 million (2017: loss of EUR 36 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness and hedging of committed facilities with respect to mortgage
loans.

Micro fair value hedge of plain vanilla funding
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate and foreign
exchange risk from its fixed rate plain vanilla funding activities above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest
rate risk and foreign exchange risk arising on this fixed rate funding. To mitigate any accounting
mismatches, NIBC has defined a micro fair value hedge for fixed rate plain vanilla funding and
corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2018 was EUR 5 million debit (2017: EUR 30 million debit). The gains
on the hedging instruments were EUR 11 million (2017: loss of EUR 34 million). The losses on the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were EUR 15 million (2017: gain of EUR 31 million).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
Portfolio fair value hedge of loans
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to interest rate risk from its
corporate loan activities above certain limits as set by ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate
swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising from these fixed rate loans. To mitigate any
accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a portfolio fair value hedge for the fixed rate loan and
corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
hedge relationships at 31 December 2018 was EUR 5 million credit (2017: EUR 9 million credit).
Gains on the hedging instruments were EUR 1 million (2017: gain of EUR 3 million). The losses on
the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were nil (2017: loss of 2 million). Differences
between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be explained by
hedge ineffectiveness.
Micro fair value hedge accounting of the Liquidity portfolio debt investments
According to NIBC's hedging policy, NIBC should not be exposed to fair value interest rate risk from
its fixed rate debt investments held in the Liquidity portfolios above certain limits prescribed by
ALCO. Consequently, NIBC uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value interest rate risk arising
on this fixed rate debt investments. To mitigate any accounting mismatches, NIBC has defined a
micro fair value hedge for fixed rate debt investments and corresponding hedging transactions.
The hedged risk is the benchmark interest rate (interbank offered rates up to one year and swap
rates for periods longer than one year) for the currency in question.
The net fair value of the derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in these
relationships at 31 December 2018 was nil. (2017: nil). The losses on the hedging instruments were
nil (2017: nil). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were nil (2017: nil).
Differences between the results recognised on the hedging instruments and hedged items can be
explained by hedge ineffectiveness.
192 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash flow hedges
NIBC has classified a large part of its corporate loans as loans and receivable at amortised cost.
Therefore, variability in the cash flows of the floating rate corporate loans is accounted for in future
periods, when the coupons are recorded in the income statement on an amortised cost basis.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the floating cash flows of its floating corporate loans. These
swaps are reported at fair value through profit or loss. This accounting mismatch creates volatility in
the income statement of NIBC. Therefore NIBC applies hedge accounting on these positions. Hedge
accounting is applied to all swaps that are used to hedge the cash flow risk of the floating corporate
loans by defining a macro cash flow hedge relationship with the floating corporate loans.
The variability in interest cash flows arising on floating rate corporate loans is hedged on a portfolio
basis with interest rate swaps that receive fixed and pay floating (generally one, three and six months
floating rates). The highly probable cash flows being hedged relate both to the highly probable cash
flows on outstanding corporate loans and to the future reinvestment of these cash flows. NIBC does
not hedge the variability of future cash flows of corporate loans arising from changes in credit
spreads.
Interest rate swaps with a net fair value of nil (2017: EUR 17 million debit) were designated in a cash
flow hedge relationship. The cash flow on the hedged item will be reported in income over the next
six years. In 2018 the ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arose from cash flow
hedges was a loss of EUR 1 million (2017: loss of EUR 5 million).
Some macro cash flow hedging relationships ceased to exist during 2018 and therefore the related
cumulative hedge adjustment as from that date is being amortised over the remaining contractual
maturity of the hedged item.
The amount that was recognised in equity for the year 2018 was EUR 2 million debit (2017:
EUR 10 million debit). The amount that was transferred from equity to the income statement in
2018 was a gain of EUR 12 million net of tax (2017: gain of EUR 7 million).

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured for all temporary differences using the liability
method.
Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carry forward losses can only be utilized if taxable profits
are realised in the future. To measure deferred tax assets, NIBC takes a management best estimate
regarding future compensation of carry forward losses. On 31 December 2018 there was a realistic
expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be generated within the applicable periods for the
recognised deferred tax asset based on internal (medium term) forecasts.

of 1 January 2015.
In 2017, in negotiation with the Works Council, new appointments were made for the annual
pension contribution for the period 2018 - 2020. As part of the negotiations the Employer agreed to
pay a one-off pension contribution of EUR 1 million to the premium reserve of the Pension Fund
before the end of December 2017.
Obligations and expense under pension plans
A collective defined-contribution plan (CDC-plan) is a pension plan under which NIBC each year
pays a fixed percentage of the salaries of the members into the scheme. The size of the fund on
retirement will be determined by how much was contributed to the scheme and the investment
return achieved.
For defined-contribution plans, NIBC pays contributions directly into the member's scheme. NIBC
has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
The CDC-plan is based on an average salary plan. The retirement age is set at 68 years as per
1 January 2018. The contribution payable by participants in the CDC-plan is maximised at 4% per
annum. Under the CDC-plan the annual pension contributions are calculated according to a fixed
contribution calculation mechanism. The annual pension contribution of NIBC is maximised at 26% of
the pensionable salary (salary minus a social security deductible). By paying the agreed fixed annual
contribution NIBC Holding is released from all its obligations.

The capital securities are perpetual and have no expiry date. The distribution on the Capital
Securities issued in September 2017 is as follows: the coupon is 6% per year and is made payable
every six months in arrears as of the issue date (29 September 2017), for the first time on 29 March
2018. The capital securities are perpetual and first redeemable on 29 September 2026. As of
29 September 2026, and subject to capital securities not being redeemed early, the distribution is set
for a further five-year period, but without a step-up, based on the 5 year euro swap rate +5.564 %.
Any payments including coupon payments are fully discretionary.
The coupon payments on capital securities amounts to EUR 13 million in 2018 .
The principal amount of the capital securities will be written down if the CET1 ratio of NIBC falls
below 5.125%. Following such reduction, the principal amount may, at NIBC's discretion, be written-
up to the original principal amount if certain conditions are met. In addition, the capital securities may
be subject to a permanent write-down or conversion into equity in circumstances where the
competent resolution authority would determine that NIBC has reached the point of non-viability or
the occurrence of a bail-in.

47.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data
47.12 Fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value
47.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
47.1 Valuation principles
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current
market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using a valuation technique.
In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a
hierarchy of valuation techniques, as follows:
■ Level 1 financial instruments - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities;
■ Level 2 financial instruments - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);
■ Level 3 financial instruments - Inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).
47.2 Valuation governance
NIBC’s fair value methodology and the governance over its models includes a number of controls and
other procedures to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure its quality and adequacy. All
new product initiatives (including their valuation methodologies) are subject to approvals by various
functions of NIBC including the Risk and Finance functions. Once submitted, fair value estimates are
also reviewed and challenged by the Risk and Finance functions.
47.3 Financial instruments by fair value hierarchy
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to
initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 within the fair value hierarchy based on the
degree to which the fair value is observable:

47.4 Valuation techniques
The following is a description of the determination of fair value for financial instruments that are
recorded at fair value using either quoted prices or valuation techniques. These incorporate NIBC's
interpretation of valuation assumptions (qualitative) that a market participant would consider when
valuing the instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Equity investments - level 1
The level 1 portfolio consists of unadjusted, quoted prices for assets in an active market. The assets
have been valued at the market’s closing price of 31 December 2018.
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2018, NIBC applied market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Loans - level 2
In an active market environment, these assets are marked-to-market by applying market bid quotes
observed on the secondary market. The quotes received from other banks or brokers and applied in
the marked-to-market process are calibrated to actual market trades whenever possible.
In certain instances, where the market is inactive, a discounted cash flow model is used based on
various assumptions including market interest rates, market credit spread levels and assumptions
regarding market liquidity, where relevant. Additional pricing reference points have been obtained by
collecting spreads using primary transactions that are comparable with the relevant loans.
Derivatives financial assets and liabilities (held for trading and used for hedging) - level 2
Derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs are mainly
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange contracts. The most
frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The
models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange rates, credit spread levels and interest
rate curves. Credit derivative valuation models also require input as to the estimated probability of
default and recovery value.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 225
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Debt investments - level 3
For the level 3 debt investments, NIBC uses valuation models that apply discounted cash flow analysis
that incorporates both observable and unobservable data. Observable inputs include interest rates
and collateral values; unobservable inputs include assumptions regarding credit spreads and market
liquidity discounts.
Equity investments (including investments in associates) - level 3
The fair value of investments in equity funds is determined based on the net asset value reported by
the managers of these funds. These net asset values are analysed for reasonableness, so as to
ascertain that the reported net asset value has been appropriately derived using proper fair value
principles as part of a robust process. To approximate the fair value at the reporting date, the net
asset value is adjusted, where appropriate, for factors such as, subsequent capital contributions and
fund distributions, movements in exchange rate and subsequent changes in the fair value of the
underlying investee companies, where these are known to NIBC.
The fair value of equity investments is established by applying capitalisation multiples to maintainable
earnings. Maintainable earnings are estimated based on the normalised last twelve months’ EBITDA.
Capitalisation multiples are derived from the enterprise value and the normalised last twelve months
EBITDA at the acquisition date. On each reporting date, the capitalisation multiple of each equity
investment is compared against those derived from the publicly available enterprise value and
earnings information of traded peers, where these can be identified. Peer capitalisation multiples are
normalised for factors such as differences in regional and economic environment, time lags in earnings
information and one-off gains and losses.
The resulting enterprise value is adjusted for net debt, non-controlling interests, illiquidity and
management incentive plans to arrive at the fair value of the equity.
Mortgage loans (own book and securitised) - level 3
NIBC determines the fair value of mortgage loans (both those NIBC holds on its own book and
those NIBC has securitised) by using a valuation model developed by NIBC. To calculate the fair
value, NIBC discounts expected cash flows (after expected prepayments) to present value using
inter-bank zero-coupon rates, adjusted for a spread that principally takes into account the credit
spread risk of the mortgages and uncertainty relating to prepayment estimates.
The RMBS spread is determined by collecting RMBS spreads from publicly issued Dutch RMBS-
transactions. The discount spread is derived by adding related RMBS costs to the RMBS spread.
Sensitivity analysis carried out on the prepayment rates used in the valuation model of the mortgage
loans showed that the variability in these rates does not have a significant impact on the total value of
the Mortgage Loan portfolio.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
Debt investments - level 1
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2018, NIBC used market-observable prices
(including broker quotes). NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time,
ensuring comparability and continuity of valuations.
226 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Debt investments - level 2
For the determination of fair value at 31 December 2018, NIBC used market-observable prices
(including broker quotes), interest rates and credit spreads derived from market-observable data.
NIBC has determined the fair value in a consistent manner over time, ensuring comparability and
continuity of valuations.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (including trading)
Own liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - level 2
This portfolio was designated at fair value through profit or loss and is reported on the face of the
balance sheet under the following headings:
■ Own debt securities in issue (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
■ Debt securities in issue structured (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss);
■ Subordinated liabilities (financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss).
Debt securities in issue structured consist of notes issued with embedded derivatives that are tailored
to specific investors’ needs. The return on these notes is dependent upon the level of certain
underlying equity, interest rate, currency, credit, commodity or inflation-linked indices. The embedded
derivative within each note issued is fully hedged on a back-to-back basis, such that effectively
synthetic floating rate funding is created. Because of this economic hedge, the income statement is
not sensitive to fluctuations in the price of these indices.
In the case of debt securities in issue structured and subordinated liabilities, the fair value of the notes
issued and the back-to-back hedging swaps is determined using valuation models developed by a
third party employing Monte Carlo simulation, lattice valuations or closed formulas, depending on the
type of embedded derivative. These models use market-observable inputs (e.g. interest rates, equity
prices) for valuation of these structures.
For each class of own financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the expected cash flows
are discounted to present value using interbank zero-coupon rates. The resulting fair value is adjusted
for movements in the credit spread applicable to NIBC issued funding.
47.5 Valuation adjustments and other inputs and considerations
Credit and debit valuation adjustments
NIBC calculates CVA/DVA (as defined in Critical accounting estimates and judgements) on a
counterparty basis over the entire life of the exposure.
Bid-offer
NIBC's asset pricing models initially calculate mid-market prices, which are subsequently adjusted to
reflect bid offer spreads (the difference between prices quoted for sales and purchases). NIBC
Markets asset pricing models use bid prices.
Day-1 profit
A Day-1 profit, representing the difference between the transaction price and the fair value output of
internal models, is recognised when the inputs to the valuation models are observable data market
data.
47.6  Impact of valuation adjustments
The following table shows the amount recorded in the income statement:

47.8 Transfers between level 1 and level 2
Except for changes due to the introduction of IFRS 9, during 2018, there were no transfers between
level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.
In 2017 debt investments at fair value through profit or loss for an amount of EUR 166 million has
been transferred from level 1 to level 2. The level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy better
reflected the underlying valuation methodology.
Transfers between levels are reviewed semi-annually at the end of the reporting period.

The following table provides a summary of the valuation techniques, key unobservable inputs and the
lower and upper range of such unobservable inputs, by type of level 3 asset/liability. The lower and
upper range mentioned in the overview represent the lowest and highest variance of the respective
valuation input as actually used in the valuation of the different financial instruments. Amounts and
percentages stated are unweighted. The range could change from period to period subject to market
movements and change in level 3 position. Lower and upper bounds reflect the variability of level 3
positions and their underlying valuation inputs in the portfolio, but do not adequately reflect their

Non-Listed equity investments
Level 3 equity securities mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity
securities which are not traded in active markets. In the absence of an active market, fair values are
estimated on the analysis of fund manager reports, company's financial position and other factors.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 233
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Discount spreads
Discount spread is the spread above a market interest rate, based on Euribor, which is used to
discount the projected cash flows. The lower range is the outcome of a bottom-up valuation
approach, the upper range is the result of a top-down valuation approach.
Expected sales prices underlying assets
The fair value of the loans available for sale is highly dependent on the projected sales prices of the
underlying assets. The lower level assumes actual sales prices of 75% of the projected sales prices the
higher level assumes actual salesprices of 125%.
Price
For securities where market prices are not available fair value is measured by comparison with
observable pricing data from similar instruments. Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no
recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay good
yield.
Debt investments AFS
Level 3 AFS debt investments are valued based on the expected cashflows of the instrument flowing
from the collateral.
47.11 Sensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in observable market data

In order to determine the reasonably possible alternative assumptions, NIBC adjusted key

■ For equity investments, the material unobservable input parameters, such as capitalisation multiple,
that are applied to the maintainable earnings to determine fair value are adjusted by 5%;
234 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ For the mortgage loans classified at fair value through profit or loss (both those NIBC holds on its
own book and those NIBC has securitised), NIBC adjusted the discount spread with 10bp as a
reasonably possible alternative outcome;
■ For the debt investments, NIBC adjusted the weighted average calculated model price by 100
basis points as a reasonably possible alternative outcome. The primary unobservable input in the
calculated model price is the applicable credit spread;
In 2017, there were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances that affect the
fair value of the NIBC's financial assets and liabilities and there were no reclassifications of financial
assets.

1 The portfolio of mortgage loans previously classified at fair value through profit or loss, which was reclassified to amortised cost during the transition to IFRS 9, has a carrying
value of EUR 4,217 million per 31 December 2018. The fair value per 31 December 2018 equals EUR 4,455 million.
2 The fair value disclosed for the mortgage loans is determined in a manner consistent with the valuation per 31 December 2017, applying a discount spread based on the observed
RMBS spread, adjusted for related RMBS costs. If the fair value of the mortgage loans is (own book plus securitised) determined applying the observed retail spread, the fair value
equals EUR 9,767 million per 31 December 2018.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value are carried at amounts that
approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These
financial instruments include cash and balances with central banks, due from other banks, due to
other banks, deposits from customers and other financial liabilities. These financial instruments are
not included in the previous table.
47.13 Non-financial assets valued at fair value
Property and equipment
NIBC's land and buildings are valued at fair value through equity. The carrying amount of NIBC's land
and buildings (level 3) as of 31 December 2018 was EUR 42 million (31 December 2017:
EUR 41 million). The land and buildings were last revalued as of 31 December 2017 based on

Related amounts which cannot be set off in the balance sheet position are amounts which are part of
ISDA netting agreements. The related amounts are reported on the asset side and the liability side of
the balance sheet as the ISDA agreements does not meet all requirements for offsetting in IAS 32.
Cash collateral pledged decreased to EUR 155 million in 2018 mainly caused by the transfer from
collatorised-to-markets to settle-to-markets.
49 Repurchase and resale agreements and transferred financial assets
NIBC has a programme to borrow and lend securities and to sell securities under agreements to
repurchase (‘repos’) and to purchase securities under agreements to resell (‘reverse repos’). The
securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase are transferred to a third party and NIBC
receives cash, or other financial assets in exchange. The counterparty is allowed to sell or repledge
those securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements in the absence of default by NIBC, but has
an obligation to return the securities at the maturity of the contract. These transactions are
conducted under terms based on the applicable ISDA Collateral Guidelines. If the securities increase
or decrease in value, NIBC may in certain circumstances, require, or be required, to pay additional
cash collateral. NIBC has determined that it retains substantially all the risks and rewards of these
securities and therefore has not derecognised them. In addition, it recognises a financial liability for
cash received as collateral.
Similarly NIBC may sell or repledge any securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to
resell, but has an obligation to return the securities and the counterparty retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership. Consequently the securities are not recognised by NIBC, which
instead records a separate asset for the cash collateral given.
NIBC conducts these transactions under terms agreed in Global Master Repurchase Agreements. As
per year-end 2018 NIBC did not have any repurchase and resale agreement related positions as
described in this note (2017: nil).
Transferred financial assets
This disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and
associated financial liabilities in order to understand which risks the bank is exposed to when the
assets are transferred.
If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised on the balance sheet, NIBC is still exposed to
changes in the fair value of the assets.

RMBS programme
NIBC uses securitisations as a source of funding whereby the Structured Entity (SE) issues debt
securities. Pursuant to a securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, NIBC transfers the title
of the assets to SEs. When the cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by
consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (residential mortgage loans) are considered to be
transferred.
The Covered Bond programme
Under NIBC's Covered Bond programme, notes are issued by NIBC from its own balance sheet.
Bond holders are protected from suffering a loss even in the event that NIBC defaults because at the
point the notes were issued, NIBC also transferred the legal title of a portfolio of mortgages to a
Structured Entity (SE) to act as collateral for the covered bond investors. From a legal perspective, the
SE guarantees the repayment of the Covered Bonds. The title transfer of the mortgages has been
achieved by NIBC providing an inter-company loan on the same terms and conditions as the external
bonds to the SE. The SE used the proceeds to purchase the mortgage portfolio. The net result is that
the SE retains the legal title, but proceeds from the mortgages are passed through the intercompany
loan to the covered bond holders. NIBC consolidates the SE on the basis that, in addition to having
power as the sole owner, NIBC also is entitled to substantial variable returns through the over-
collateralised portion of the sold mortgages.
Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets that are derecognised in their
entirety
NIBC does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where
NIBC has continuing involvement.
50 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-
interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
238 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.
The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table
by category. In the following table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced.
The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would
be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.

These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC’s policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 56 Credit risk.
240 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Contingent liabilities related to income tax
The European Commission has addressed questions related to the Dutch Government about article
29a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code. If the European Commission would decide to start a
formal investigation and ultimately would conclude that this is a case of state aid, NIBC may have to
repay tax benefits it will enjoy from 208 onwards Article 29a of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax
Code was included in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Code so that capital instruments issued by
credit institutions and which are covered by EU regulation 575/2013 would be considered tax
deductible. In this context NIBC issued Capital Securities in September 2017, amounting
EUR 200 million at a fixed interest rate of 6%. The contingent liability related to this matter may start
at the (fully discretionary) first coupon payment date (scheduled in March 2018).
Claims, investigations, litigation or other proceedings or actions may have a
material adverse effect on NIBC’s business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.
NIBC is involved in a number of proceedings and settlement negotiations that arise with customers,
counterparties, current or former employees or others arising in the ordinary course of business.
Proceedings may relate to, for example, alleged violations of NIBC’s duty of care (zorgplicht) vis-a-vis
its (former) customers, the provision of allegedly inadequate investment advice or the provision of
allegedly inadequate services. Negative publicity associated with certain sales practices, compensation
payable in respect of such issues or regulatory changes resulting from such issues could have a
material adverse effect on NIBC’s reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. Dutch financial services providers are increasingly exposed to collective claims from
groups of customers or consumer organisations seeking damages for an unspecified or indeterminate
amount or involving unprecedented legal claims in respect of assumed mis-selling or other violations
of law or customer rights.
While NIBC has made considerable investment in reviewing and assessing historic sales and “know
your customer' practices and in the maintenance of risk management, legal and compliance
procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be no assurance that all of the issues
associated with current and historic sales practices have been or will be identified, nor that any issues
already identified will not be more widespread than presently estimated. Assessments of the
likelihood of claims arising from former activities are often difficult to accurately assess, due to the
difficulties in applying more recent standards or court judgements to past practices. Furthermore
many individual transactions are heavily fact-specific and the likelihood of applicability to more
transactions of a court decision received on one particular transaction, is difficult to predict until a
claim actually materialises and is elaborated. Changes in customer protection regulations and in
interpretation and perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable
market practices might also influence client expectations. One example of past practice that is
currently being subjected to a current review of the correctness of such behaviour relates to
EURIBOR-based mortgages. In 2017 NIBC acquired a portfolio of mortgages and, as part of such
acquisition, took over a number of such EURIBOR-based mortgages. Such types of mortgages are
currently the subject of individual and class action claims towards another financial institution within
the Netherlands. The claimants contest the contractual right of such mortgage lender to have
adjusted the margin and allege that the mortgage lender violated its duty of care towards the relevant
customers. These claims are currently the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, with a verdict
being expected in early 2019. Given the similarity of the facts to the EURIBOR-based mortgages
within the portfolio acquired by NIBC, NIBC is monitoring such developments and has notified the
relevant clients that it will apply the outcome of these court proceedings to the EURIBOR-based
loans acquired by NIBC. The risks related to this legal issue were taken into account at the time of
acquisition of this mortgage portfolio and factored into the consideration paid by NIBC at the time.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 241
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
It is difficult for NIBC to predict the outcome of many of the pending or future claims, regulatory
proceedings and other adversarial proceedings. The costs and staffing capacity required to defend
against future actions may be significant. Counterparties in these proceedings may also seek publicity,
over which NIBC will have no control, and this publicity could lead to reputational harm to NIBC and
potentially decrease customer acceptance of NIBC’s services, regardless of whether the allegations
are valid or whether NIBC is ultimately found liable. In addition, NIBC’s provisions for defending these
claims may not be sufficient.
In cases where the potential financial outcomes of expected settlements can be reliably estimated,
NIBC has made such estimates. NIBC has recognised an aggregated provision based on those
estimates. The associated loss has been recognised in ‘Other operating expenses’. Any settlements
resulting in economic benefits are recognised in the same line item, if and when these become
virtually certain. During 2018 NIBC was involved in a legal procedure with a former IT outsourcing
service provider. In January 2019 the legal proceedings have been terminated by a settlement on
mutual satisfactory terms. NIBC does not disclose detailed information regarding such provisions
and/or settlements as such disclosures could seriously prejudice its position and/or disclosures are not
allowed based on the settlement agreements. The settlement has no material impact on the financial
performance of NIBC.
On the basis of legal advice, taking into consideration the facts known at present NIBC is of the
opinion that the outcome of these proceedings is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results.

53 Related party transactions
In the normal course of business, NIBC enters into various transactions with related parties. Parties
are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control or exercise significant influence
over the other party in making financial or operating decisions. Related parties of NIBC include,
amongst others, its subsidiaries, associates and key management personnel. The transactions were
made at an arm’s length price. Transactions between NIBC and its subsidiaries meet the definition of
related party transactions. However, as all of these transactions are eliminated on consolidation, they
are not disclosed as related party transactions.

All intended deals with related parties, including the JC Flowers Fund IV related to the majority

transaction with J.C. Flowers Fund IV is at arm's length.
At 2 November 2018 NIBC Bank committed to a co-investment of EUR 30 million in HSH
Nordbank along with the 'Flowers Fund IV'. NIBC Bank's exposure to HSH Nordbank at
31 December 2018 is EUR 30 million. Due to the existing relationship with the J.C. Flowers Funds a
waiver has been obtained for certain fees.
In 2018, EUR 7 million fee related to the purchase of HSH Nordbank by a consortium led by J.C.
Flowers Funds, where NIBC acted as the M&A advisor for the buyer has been received.
In March 2016, NIBC Holding N.V. (the parent company of NIBC Bank N.V.) acquired Beequip B.V.
(Beequip). Before and after the acquisition, NIBC financed Beequip. At acquisition date the (long-
term) loan to Beequip amounted to EUR 52 million. NIBC's exposure at 31 December 2018
amounted to EUR 368 million (31 December 2017: EUR 208 million).
In May 2015, NIBC obtained control of Vijlma B.V. with a view to resale to NIBC Investments N.V. (a
subsidiary of the parent company of NIBC). Subsequently Vijlma B.V. was sold to NIBC Investments
N.V. on 30 June 2015. NIBC's exposure to Vijlma B.V. at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017
is nihil.

Key management personnel investments
NIBC’s key management personnel, and persons connected with them, are also considered to be
related parties for disclosure purposes. Key management personnel is defined as those persons
having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of NIBC
(directly or indirectly). In 2018 key management personnel was brought in line with the internal
management reporting. Consequently key management personnel of NIBC consist of the ExCo
members (including Statutory Board members) instead of the Identified staff group as of 2018. The
comparative disclosures for 2017 were adjusted accordingly.
Details of the remuneration of the Statutory Board members and Supervisory Board members are
disclosed in note 56. For details of the holdings of Statutory Board members and other staff in NIBC
Choice instruments reference is made to note 9 Personnel expenses and share-based payments.
Other transactions with key management personnel and related parties
In 2018 key management personnel (ExCo members) were granted CDRs under the one-off

(for further details see note 56).
Details of the remuneration of the Statutory Board members and Supervisory Board members are
disclosed in note 56. For details of the holdings of Statutory Board members in NIBC Choice
instruments reference is also made to note 56.

Information on subsidiaries
Composition of NIBC
NIBC consists of 42 (2017: 50) consolidated entities, including 11 (2017: 15) consolidated structured
entities (for further details see note 55). 31 (2017: 33) of the entities controlled by NIBC are directly
or indirectly held by NIBC at 100% of the ownership interests (share of capital). Third parties also
hold ownership interests in 11 (2017: 17) of the consolidated entities (non-controlling interests).
Accounting for investment in subsidiaries
In the company financial statements of NIBC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at net asset value.
Principal subsidiaries
NIBC's principal subsidiaries are set out in the following table. This includes those subsidiaries that are

Significant judgements and assumptions used to determine the scope of the consolidation
Determining whether NIBC has control of an entity is generally straightforward, based on ownership
of the majority of the voting rights. However, in certain instances this determination will involve
significant judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not
the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement may involve assessing
the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether NIBC, or
another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right
or as an agent on behalf of others.
There is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over
structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other
investors’ exposures to the structure’s variable returns have been substantively eliminated, NIBC may
conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore NIBC will
consolidate the structured entity.
An interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% (or in certain circumstances large minority
shareholding) would typically indicate that NIBC has control of an entity. However certain entities are
excluded from consolidation because NIBC does not have exposure to their variable returns and/or
are managed by external parties and consequently are not controlled by NIBC. Where appropriate,
interests relating to these entities are included in note 55 Structured entities.
See the basis of consolidation section of the Accounting policies for further information on other
factors affecting consolidation of an entity.
Significant restrictions to access or use NIBC’s assets
Legal, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests
might restrict the ability of NIBC to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within
NIBC and to settle liabilities of NIBC.
Since NIBC did not have any material non-controlling interests at the balance sheet date, any
protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions.
Restrictions impacting NIBC’s ability to use assets:
■ NIBC has pledged assets to collateralise its obligations under repurchase agreements, securities
financing transactions, collateralised loan obligations and for margining purposes of OTC derivative
liabilities;
■ The assets of consolidated structured entities are held for the benefit of the parties that have
bought the notes issued by these entities; and
■ Regulatory and central bank requirements or local corporate legislation may restrict NIBC’s ability
to transfer assets to or from other entities within NIBC in certain jurisdictions.

55 Structured entities
A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined
objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.
The principal use of structured entities is to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets
and to provide market liquidity for clients through securitising financial assets. Structured entities may
be established as corporations, trusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the
purchase of assets by issuing notes that are collateralised by and/or indexed to the assets held by the
structured entities. The notes issued by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of
subordination.
Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between NIBC and the
structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by NIBC, as pointed out in the
Accounting policies section Basis of consolidation. In other cases it may sponsor or have exposure to
such an entity but not consolidate it.
Consolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in consolidated structured entities
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC primarily has contractual arrangements for securitisation vehicles which may require it to
provide financial support. NIBC uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk
transfer. At 31 December 2018 and 2017, there were no significant outstanding loan commitments
to these entities.
Financial support provided or to be provided to consolidated structured entities
NIBC has not provided any non-contractual financial support during 2018 and 2017 and does not
anticipate providing non-contractual support to consolidated structured entities in the future.
Unconsolidated structured entities
Nature, purpose and extent of NIBC’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities
252 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The structured entities covered by this section are not consolidated since NIBC does not has control
them through voting rights, contract, funding agreements and/or other means. The extent of NIBC’s
interests in unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entity.
Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments,
liquidity facilities and guarantees in which NIBC is absorbing variability of returns from the structured
entities.
Securitisation vehicles
NIBC established securitisation vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed-
income securities, corporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial, residential
and mortgage-backed assets). The securitisation vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple
tranches of notes.
Third-party fund entities
NIBC provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the
form of funding entities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralised by the
asset in the structured entities. NIBC’s involvement involves predominantly equity investments.
Income derived from involvement with unconsolidated structured entities
NIBC earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment
management services in relation to funds. Interest income is recognised on the funding provided to
structured entities. Movements in the value of different types of notes held by NIBC in structured
entities are recognised in net trading income.
Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities
The maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the
unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is
reflected in their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for
off-balance sheet instruments such as guarantees, liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS
12, as interpreted by NIBC, is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts do not reflect the
economic risks faced by NIBC because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or
hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred.
At 31 December 2018 off-balance sheet instruments amounts to EUR 20 million (2017:
EUR 14 million). There were no derivatives linked to structured unconsolidated entities.
Size of structured entities
NIBC provides a different measure for the size of structured entities depending on their type. The
following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of
structured entities:
■ Securitisations – notional of notes in issue when NIBC derives its interests through notes its holds
and notional of derivatives when NIBC’s interests is in the form of derivatives; and
■ Third party fund entities – total assets in entities. For third party fund entities, size information is
based on the latest available investor reports and financial statements.
Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The following table shows, by type of unconsolidated structured entity, the carrying amounts of
NIBC’s interests recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the
maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. It also provides an indication of the size of
the structured entities. The carrying amounts presented in the following table do not reflect the

Exposure to losses
NIBC’s exposure to losses related to securitisations depends on the level of subordination of the
interest which indicates the extent to which other parties are obliged to absorb credit losses before
NIBC. This is summarised in the following table. There is no significant level of subordination relating
to third-party funding.

Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities
As a sponsor, NIBC is involved in the legal structure and marketing of the entity and supports the
entity in different ways, namely:
■ transferring assets to the entities; and
■ providing operational support to ensure the entity’s continued operation.
NIBC is also deemed a sponsor for a structured entity if market participants would reasonably
associate the entity with NIBC. Additionally, the use of the NIBC name for the structured entity
indicates that NIBC has acted as a sponsor.

56 Remuneration of the Statutory Board members and Supervisory
Board members
Remuneration of the Statutory Board members
The Supervisory Board reviewed and amended NIBC's Remuneration Policy in 2018. The review
took account of all relevant laws, regulations and guidelines: the Dutch Corporate Governance Code,
the Dutch Banking Code, the DNB Principles on Sound Remuneration Policies (DNB Principles), EBA
Guidelines on sound Remuneration and CRD IV and the Dutch remuneration legislation for Financial
Service Companies (Wet beloning Financiële ondernemingen - Wbfo).
Regular annual remuneration
In 2018, the average number of members of the Statutory Board appointed under the articles of
association was 3 (2017: 3). For the total regular annual remuneration costs (including pension costs)
for members of the Statutory Board, appointed under the articles of association, reference is made
to note 9 Personnel expenses and share-based payments. During 2018 no changes occurred in the
Statutory Board.
Base salary and short-term incentive compensation (cash bonus)
In 2018, the base salary for the Chairman and for members of the Statutory Board increased with
respectively 3% and 9%. As of 1 January 2015, in light of the legislation on remuneration for Financial
Service Companies and the social context, the long-term incentive arrangement (40% to 70% of base
salary) was revoked by the Supervisory Board and replaced by a short-term variable income
component at target of 15% of base salary (with a maximum of 20%).The variable compensation is
delivered in a pre-defined mix: 30% in cash, 20% in deferred cash, 30% in Phantom Share Units and
20% in Restricted Phantom Share Units.
Over 2018 the following incentive compensation (excluding one-off retention package) of base salary
was granted: The Chief Executive Officer 20%, The Chief Financial Officer 20% and the Chief Risk
Officer 20%.

Co-investment programme
As a result of personal investments by the Statutory Board members in 2012 and 2014 matching
shares were granted to the Statutory Board members in 2012 and 2014, in the form of CRDRs with
an after-tax value equal to the value of the personal investment made. NIBC has the discretion to
offer new members of the Statutory Board the opportunity to participate in this co-investment
programme under the same conditions.
This offer was made to and accepted by Mr Dijkhuizen and Mr. de Wilt when they joined the
Statutory Board.
The matching shares were subject to four-year vesting with one quarter vesting each year on
1 January, but they will immediately vest upon a change of control of NIBC Holding N.V. in which
case they (i) will become fully unconditional and (ii) be legally transferred.
In December 2017 it was decided that all unvested CRDR outstanding at 1 January 2018 will vest
immediately (accelerated vesting) into CCDRs. The accelerated vesting applied to 3.558 CRDRs (net
after tax basis) related to the cancellation of the Long Term Incentive arrangement for certain
Statutory Board members.
According to the change of the Plan Rules in 2017, the 70,788 outstanding CCDRs of certain
Statutory Board members were released into 70,788 CDRs in January 2018.
(Restricted) Phantom Share Units
Phantom Share Units
In 2010, a new equity-linked reward instrument was introduced as part of the Short-Term Incentive
(STI) plan. The short-term compensation in share-related awards consists of Phantom Share Units
(PSUs) and/or Restricted Phantom Share Units (RPSUs). RPSU awards are subject to a three-year
vesting with one third vesting each year on 1 April. The PSUs, whether vested or restricted, held by
the members of the Statutory Board are subject to a five-year retention period as measured from
the date of vesting. This short-term compensation can be converted into cash immediately after the
retention period.

57 Credit risk
This section includes all financial assets subject to credit risk. Non-credit obligations fall under other
risk types, such as market risk, and equity is subject to investment risk. Figures may not always add up
due to rounding. The following portfolios that contain credit risk have been identified:
■ Corporate/Investment Loans;
■ Lease receivables;
■ Mortgage loans;
■ Debt Investments;
■ Cash Management;
■ Derivatives.

Table 57-1 presents the maximum credit risk exposure per portfolio, without taking collateral or any
other credit risk reduction into consideration. For all portfolios except derivatives, this is generally the
total commitment of NIBC, which also includes off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees
and undrawn credit lines.
262 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The figures in table 57-1 are not directly comparable to the figures on the balance sheet. Mortgage
loans are recognised on the balance sheet under mortgage loans own book and securitised mortgage
loans. Debt investments (securitisations) differ from the figure on the balance sheet due to off-
balance sheet exposures as disclosed in the Risk Management notes.
NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based
(AIRB) approach for quantifying the credit quality of corporate, retail and bank counterparties. The
AIRB methodology for corporate counterparties was approved by NIBC’s regulatory authority, the
DNB, in 2008. In 2014, NIBC also received approval from the DNB to use the AIRB methodology for
bank counterparties.
Corporate loans
Corporate loan distribution
The industry sectors shown in tables 57-2 and 57-3 are based on internal NIBC sector organisation.
NIBC steers its business on internal sector classification, however it can be mapped to the industry
sectors of NACE classification, if necessary. For comparability purposes portfolio breakdown based
on NACE codes is also provided in a separate document published on NIBC’s annual report website.
Tables 57-2 and 57-3 display a breakdown of the Corporate Loan portfolio among regions and
industry sectors, at year-end 2018 and 2017. The Corporate Loan portfolio increased by
EUR 20 million in 2018 to EUR 9,413 million mainly due to exposure increases in the industry
sectors: Industries & Manufacturing (I&M) and Shipping & Intermodal (S&I). The relative weight of
NIBC’s core growth market the Netherlands increased, and the weight of Rest of Europe slightly
increased. The corporate loan portfolio in the Netherlands increased to 45% of the total exposure at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 42%).

CRR/CRD IV and credit approval process
NIBC employs an internally-developed methodology under AIRB approach for quantifying the credit
quality of its Corporate Loan portfolio. In line with CRR/CRD IV regulations, the methodology
consists of three elements:
■ CCR, reflecting the through-the-cycly PD of the borrower. The default definition is in line with the
CRR/CRD IV definition1
■ LGD, defined as an anticipated loss in the event of default and under an economic downturn
assumption, which takes into account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ EAD, which is the amount that is expected to be outstanding at the moment a counterparty
defaults.
The CRR/CRD IV PDs, LGDs and EADs that are calculated through NIBC's internal models are used
for the calculation of expected loss (EL) and regulatory capital (RC). Economic capital (EC), risk-
adjusted return on capital (RAROC), limit setting and stress testing are additional areas which make
use of these parameters, although the values and methodologies for both EC and stress testing differ
from those employed in Pillar 1. PDs, LGDs and EADs are also used in the CRR/CRD IV solvency
report to the regulator.
Annual backtests of the internal rating framework are carried out to assess the quality and the
performance of the models. The internal CCRs and LGDs are also benchmarked periodically with the
scales of external rating agencies.
NIBC enforces strict separation of responsibilities with respect to its internal rating methodologies
and rating process, model development, model validation and internal audit. The roles and
responsibilities of each department involved are explicitly set out in internal policies and manuals, also
in conformity with the stipulations of CRR/CRD IV on model governance. 
1 According to the CRR/CRD IV definition, a default is determined at the borrower level. A default is indicated by using a 9 or 10 rating in NIBC’s
internal rating scale. A default is considered to have occurred with respect to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events
have taken place: i) the bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the
bank to actions such as realising security (if held); ii) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group.
264 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IFRS9 for expected credit loss determination
In order to calculate the Expected Credit Losses (ECL), NIBC has transformed the CRDIV/CRR
PD/LGD/EAD to unbiased and point-in-time best-estimates by applying probability-weighted
forward-looking scenarios for relevant macroeconomic factors. The ECL consists of three elements:
■ Point-in-time PD of the borrower, which is an estimate of the default rate over any specified
horizon based on the current state of the credit cycle and the anticipated macroeconomic
scenarios. 
■ Point-in-time LGD, defined as the unbiased loss estimate at a future default date, which takes into
account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ Point-in-Time EAD, which is the estimation of the exposure at a future default date, taking into
account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments and
prepayments of principal and interest, and expected drawdowns on undrawn committed facilities.
Credit approval process
All approvals of individual credit proposals are granted after risk management has made a credit risk
assessment and has analysed proposals by taking into consideration, among others, aggregate limits
set per country, per industry segment, and per individual counterparty. The total one obligor
exposure and related exposure are also taken into account. Individual credit and transaction
proposals are then approved in the Transaction Committee (TC). Proposals, credit reviews and
amendments of smaller scale can be approved outside the TC by risk management. All
counterparties and, subsequently, all facilities, are reviewed at least once a year.
Credit ratings
NIBC uses an internal through-the-cycle CCR rating scale which consists of 10 grades (1-10) and a
total of 22 notches. This internal rating table relates to the tables in note 25 and note 27 showing the
credit quality and the maximum exposure to credit risk. The CCRs 9 and 10 are assigned to
counterparties that have already defaulted and therefore carry a PD of 100%.

The weighted average CCR of the non-defaulted clients remained stable during 2018 to 6+ with an
average PD of 1.8% at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 1.9%). The credit quality in terms of
CCRs remained concentrated in the sub-investment grade categories 5 and 6 (BB and B categories in
external rating agencies’ scales).
Graph 57-4 shows the distribution of the drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposure per CCR.
The numbers on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s internal rating scale, whereas the letters in
parentheses refer to the equivalent rating scale of Standard & Poor’s. NR stands for not ratable, which
was a negligible portion of the corporate loans (0.1% at 31 December 2018; 0.2% at 31 December
2017). NR is assigned to entities for which NIBC’s corporate rating tools were not suitable at the
time of rating.

Collateral and LGD
NIBC's internal LGD scale consists of 7 grades (A-F) and 10 notches, each of which represents a
different degree of recovery prospects and loss expectations. LGD ratings are facility-specific. The
weighted average LGD remained stable at B-1 grade with improved average LGD of 13.8% at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 15.3%). The weighted average LGD is calculated for non-
defaulted loans and is weighted by exposure. Nearly all facilities within NIBC have some form of
collateralisation, resulting in LGDs concentrated (at inception) in those LGD categories which
correspond to high recoveries in the range of 80% and 90%.
Graph 57-5 shows the distribution of drawn and undrawn corporate loan exposures per LGD. The
letters on the horizontal axis refer to NIBC’s LGD grades and notches, whereas the numbers in

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note that the corporate loan exposure of graph 57-5 refers to non-defaulted exposure as the LGD
is a measure of anticipated loss for facilities of a non-defaulted counterparty.
The most significant types of collateral securing the loan and derivative portfolios are tangible assets,
such as real estate, vessels, rigs and equipment. Exposures in the shipping and offshore energy sectors
are primarily secured by moveable assets such as vessels and drilling vessels. The commercial real
estate portfolio is primarily collateralised by mortgages on financed properties. The fair value of
collateral affects the LGD and therefore indirectly affects the calculation of 'expected credit loss' (ECL)
and is generally assessed at inception and periodically re-assessed thereafter. Collateral value on a
going concern basis is estimated using third-party appraisers, whenever possible, or valuation
techniques based on common market practice. Realisable collateral value is determined as collateral
value after haircuts for factors such as business cycle, location, asset construction status or guarantor
counterparty rating. For example, loan-to-value ratios are regularly tested and vessels are appraised
semi-annually by external parties. Other commercial exposures are, to a large extent, collateralised
by assets such as inventory, debtors, lease and other receivables and third-party credit protection
(e.g. guarantees).
Arrears
The total arrears in the Corporate Loan portfolio to the total outstanding increased to 0.9% at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 0.6%). An overview of the amounts in arrear per arrear
bucket is provided in tables 57-6 and 57-7. The exposure amounts refer to drawn and undrawn
amounts of those facilities with an arrear, whereas the outstanding amounts refer to the drawn
amounts only. The amounts in arrear are the actual amounts overdue at 31 December 2018 and
31 December 2017. The column labelled ‘Impairment Amount’ includes IFRS 9 stage 3 assets only
(31 December 2018: EUR 129 million), which can be compared to IAS 39 on-balance sheet
impairment amount (31 December 2017: EUR 126 million) with inclusion of Incurred but not Reported
(IBNR) impairment amounts (31 December 2017: EUR 17million). Loans that are impaired but do
not have payment arrears represent restructured loans which are now current on its payment
obligations. Tables 57-11 and 57-12 provide more information on impairment amounts.
Note that 31 December 2018 figures are compared with 31 December 2017 figures, although the
basis of presentation for some figures was different due to the implementation of IFRS 9. Due to
IFRS9 classification, the IAS 39 impairments are compared with the IFRS 9 stage 3 impairments.

NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a loan carries a non-material arrear. If the total of
the sum of all individual arrears on facility level is lower than 1% of the loan amount outstanding and
EUR 500, and the oldest due date of individual counterparty is less than 90 days, then the arrear is
considered insignificant. If arrears fall within the threshold, the exposure is placed on the ‘no payment
in arrear’ line on tables 57-6 and 57-7. The application of this threshold does not influence the total
arrears, which amounted to EUR 69 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
EUR 49 million).
Graph 57-8 displays the rating distribution of the exposure amounts (expressed as the sum of drawn
and undrawn amounts) of all loans with an amount in arrears. The total exposure amount at
31 December 2018 was EUR 367 million (31 December 2017: EUR 184 million) and the total drawn
amount at 31 December 2018 was EUR 178million (31 December 2017: EUR 184 million).

Forbearance and non-performing Corporate Loans
NIBC considers a client to be forborne if:
1. NIBC considers the obligor to be in financial difficulties, and
268 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. NIBC grants a concession to the obligor
Financial difficulties are defined as a debtor facing or about to face difficulties meeting financial
obligations. Concession refers to one of the following (per facility):
■ Modification of terms or conditions of a troubled facility to allow sufficient debt service capacity
(that would not be granted if the obligor were not in financial difficulties);
■ (partial) Refinancing of a troubled facility (that would not be granted without financial difficulties).
An obligor is considered non-performing if one or more of the following criteria are applicable:
■ Material exposures are more than 90 days past due;
■ The obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without realisation of collateral;
■ A performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional forbearance measures or
becomes more than 30 days past due.
The first two criteria are the same as the default criteria and therefore a defaulted obligor is always
non-performing as well.
Tables 57-9 and 57-10 provide the total forborne outstanding in NIBC’s Corporate Loan portfolio
per industry sector and per region as at 31 December 2018. The forborne outstanding is divided in
performing and non-performing outstanding. NIBC considers a client non-performing if that client is
in default, or if a performing forborne facility under probation is extended additional forbearance
measures, or becomes more than 30 days past due. At the end of December 2018, EUR 70 million
non-performing outstanding was not forborne. Comparable figures for 2017 can be seen in Tables
57-11 and 57-12.

Expected credit losses amounts
With the exception of purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, ECL is determined
under the following three stages:
■ Stage 1 – For newly originated loans and loans with no significant increase in their credit risk, the
ECL is determined on a 12-month horizon;
■ Stage 2 – For loans with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), ECL is determined on a
(remaining) lifetime basis. The assessment of SICR incorporates forward-looking information and is
performed on a regular basis at an obligor level.
■ Stage 3 - For defaulted and credit-impaired loans, the ECL is determined on a (remaining) lifetime
basis and based on facility-specific cash flow scenarios. The loss amount is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows. If collateral is present, then the present value of the future cash flows reflects the
foreclosure of collateral. More information on the method impairments are calculated is included
in the Accounting Policies section.
NIBC determines a default on a borrower level, whereas the credit-impaired definition is applied at
facility level. When a default occurs, the entire exposure and outstanding amount of the borrower
are classified as defaulted. If, however, stage 3 expected credit loss amount is taken on a facility, only
the exposure amount of that particular facility is classified as credit-impaired.
In 2018, the total write-offs (EUR 48 million) decreased compared to 2017 (EUR 52 million), mainly
in Shipping & Intermodal and Telecom, media, technology & services sectors. The stock of
impairments (related to stage 3 assets) decreased and amounted to EUR 129 million at year-end
2018 (year-end 2017: EUR 143 million).
Tables 57-14 and 57-15 display an overview of IFRS 9 stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 ECL amounts at
31 December 2018 and IAS 39 impairments amount 31 December 2017, subdivided in industry
sectors and regions, respectively. Note that it is relevant to compare IFRS 9 stage 3 ECL amount in
2018 with IAS 39 impairment amount in 2017. The column labelled ‘Exposure’ includes both drawn

Corporate loans without impairments or arrears
At 31 December 2018, the size of the corporate loan exposure carrying stage 1 and stage 2 credit
losses equalled EUR 8,072 million or 96% of the total Corporate Loan portfolio (31 December 2017:
EUR 8,592 million or 96%). Graph 57-16 displays the distribution of exposure amounts without
(stage 3) impairments or arrears, at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017. Of this exposure
94% is rated in CCR categories 4, 5 and 6 (BBB, BB and B categories in external rating agencies’
scales). NR represents a negligible part of the portfolio (31 December 2018: 0.1% of all loans without
stage 3 credit losses or amounts in arrear; 31 December 2017: 0.2%).

Country risk
Country risk is the risk that an entity defaults due to political, social, economical or financial turmoil in
its applicable jurisdiction(s). Country risk can potentially be an important cause of increased
counterparty default risk since a large number of individual debtors could default at the same time.
NIBC did not experience any counterparty defaults from this risk in 2018.
Investment loans
Investment loans are originated and monitored separately from the Corporate Loan portfolio.
Investment loans are typically (unsecured) subordinated loans that contain equity characteristics such
as attached warrants or conversion features. As such, investment loans typically carry a higher risk
profile than corporate loans. Examples of these loans include mezzanine loans, convertible loans and
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 277
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
shareholder loans. Note that not all investment loans are meeting SPPI requirements on the balance
sheet. Those that meet the SPPI requirements are subject to ECL and those that fail SPPI
requirements are classified at FVTPL as at 1 January 2018.
The investment loan can be divided into indirect investments and direct investments. Indirect
investments are investments made through funds (NIBC Funds). Direct investments are all other
investments.
Direct investments or commitments in NIBC Funds are approved by the Investment Committee (IC)
of NIBC. Indirect investments are approved by the investment committees of the NIBC Funds,
subject to the investment guidelines stipulated in the fund agreements between the manager of the
NIBC Fund and the investors.
Investment officers monitor the quality of counterparties in the portfolio on a regular basis. On a
quarterly basis, the entire Investment Loan portfolio is assessed for impairment. All existing
impairments are reviewed. Impairments of indirect investments are determined by the manager of
the NIBC Fund. All impairments are reviewed and approved by the IC.
The total size of investment loans at 31 December 2018 was EUR 240 million (31 December 2017:
EUR 220 million), of which 98% had been drawn (31 December 2017: 91%). In line with the
characteristics of the asset class, investment loans typically carry riskier internal CCRs and often a
higher LGD than corporate loans. At 31 December 2018, the weighted average counterparty credit
rating (CCR) of non-defaulted investment loans remained stable at an internal rating 6 (31 December
2017: 6) on NIBC’s internal rating scale (equivalent to B on external rating agencies’ scales).

Lease receivables
In 2014, NIBC obtained a leasing portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Gallinat-Bank AG in
Germany. This is a static portfolio and strict criteria were in place to determine the eligibility of lease
contracts for this programme. These were entered into with German lessees to finance moveable
objects such as trucks and trailers. The contracts are to commercial clients in the German SME
market and consist of hire purchase contracts, partially amortising and fully amortising lease contracts.
The servicing of this portfolio remains with the leasing company. The portfolio is financed by NIBC
via a ring-fenced structure benefiting from credit enhancement. At the end of December 2018, the
leasing portfolio continues to decrease from the original EUR 221 million to EUR 21 million.
EUR 32 million of leases on the balance sheet are related to one single counterparty.

The Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of owner occupied mortgages. These contain
NIBC Direct loans originated by business partners since 2013, as well as white label mortgage loans
that were also originated by business partners till 2009 or acquired through third parties. Buy-to-Let
(NIBC Vastgoed Hypotheek) mortgages for investors were started in January 2015.This niche
currently comprises approximately 7% of the total mortgage portfolio. Servicing and administration of
the mortgage portfolio is outsourced to third-party servicers. Acceptance and special servicing is
performed in-house.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At 31 December 2018, 24% of the Mortgage loan portfolio (31 December 2017: 29%) had a Dutch
government guarantee (NHG guarantee) in accordance with the general terms and conditions set by
the Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woningen (WEW, Social Housing Guarantee Fund).
A part of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio has been securitised to obtain external funding. NIBC
generally retains the junior notes As a result the securitisation programmes are consolidated on
NIBC’s balance sheet. The total amount of the retained positions at 31 December 2018 was
EUR 33.6 million (31 December 2017: EUR 26.5 million).
Risk governance Dutch Mortgages loans
In order to control the credit risk in the origination of residential mortgage loans, an acceptance
policy framework was formulated to screen residential mortgage applications. Acceptance depends
on the following underwriting criteria:
■ Conformity with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Credits of the Dutch Bankers Association
where applicable;
■ A check of an applicant’s credit history with the Dutch National Credit Register (Bureau Krediet
Registratie or BKR), a central credit agency used by financial institutions in the Netherlands, which
records five years of financial commitments and negative credit events;
■ Mortgage loans are secured by first-ranking mortgage rights;
■ Other criteria, such as type of property, maximum Loan-To-Market Value (LTMV), maximum Loan-
to-Income (LTI) and minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR);
■ Underwriting criteria for mortgages with an NHG guarantee are set in accordance with the
general terms and conditions set by the WEW. The WEW finances itself by a one-off up-front
charge to the borrower as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan. The NHG
guarantee covers losses on the outstanding principal, accrued unpaid interest, and disposal costs,
caused by foreclosure.
In 2018, the following amendments were implemented:
■ The maximum NHG guaranteed loan amount increased to EUR 265 thousand.
■ Maximum Loan-to-Value decreased to 100% in 2018 for owner occupied mortgages. For Buy-to-
Let mortgages, maximum LTMV in rented state is currently 70% (not regulated by law).
Management of loans in arrears Dutch Mortgages loans
In order to control the credit risk in the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio, NIBC has established
procedures to manage all loan amounts in arrears. All amounts in arrears are managed in-house. This
ensures a dedicated team focused on preventing and minimising credit losses. The Special Servicing
Mortgages team is responsible for arrears, client retention, foreclosures, collecting remaining debts
and visiting clients and properties that serve as collateral.
The special servicing at NIBC is focused on intensive contact with its mortgage clients and tailor-
made solutions. When amounts in arrears occur, the borrower receives a letter after the first day of
arrears. Within one week, the client is contacted by phone. Depending on the outcome of these
contacts, a customer-specific approach is formulated on a case-by-case basis. Customer visits are
made if arrears reach two months. In case of defaults, the Special Servicing team has to submit the
file to the Arrears Management Committee for approval of the strategy to be followed. The Arrears
Management Committee includes members from Risk Management, Operations, Portfolio
Management and the Special Servicing team. NIBC bids for own foreclosed properties at auctions to
ensure the proceeds are at arm’s length. If needed, NIBC acquires these properties.
282 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NIBC has introduced a programme where vulnerable customers that may face potential future
financial difficulties are approached pro-actively with the intention of identifying and resolving
difficulties before actual arrears arise.
Table 57-23 shows the arrears overview of the total Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December
2018 and 31 December 2017. Overall, the notional amount in arrears decreased compared to year

Forbearance Dutch Mortgage loans
NIBC has developed a forbearance policy for mortgage clients experiencing financial difficulties and
who consequently are unable to meet the original terms and conditions of the contract. The
forbearance policy is defined, formalised and implemented in the standard working routines and
processes and is similar to the policy applied for the corporate loan portfolio.
NIBC has been providing a forbearance program to its mortgagers who are experiencing financial
difficulties since May 2013. The Client Retention team of the Special Servicing department has the
responsibility of assessing the nature and the expected duration of a client’s financial distress, and will
determine necessity of providing forbearance measures to that client and the conditions that should
apply. The team considers forbearance solutions for clients who do not fully meet their financial
obligations to NIBC. Forbearance solutions are also submitted to the Arrears Management
Committee for further approval. At 31 December 2017, EUR 43 million was forborne of which
EUR 29 million was performing and EUR 15 million non-performing. At 31 December 2018,
EUR 50 million was reported as forborne of which EUR 35 million was performing and
EUR 16 million non-performing.
Risk measurement Dutch Mortgage loans
NIBC’s rating methodology for residential mortgage loans has been used for determining regulatory
capital requirements since 2008. The calculation of PD, LGD and EAD for owner- occupied
mortgages is performed by an internally-developed CRR/CRD IV AIRB model (for Buy-to-Let
mortgages, Basel standardised approach for credit risk is used).
The PD estimates are dependent on a variety of factors, of which the key factors are debt- to-
income and loan-to-value ratios. Minor factors that play a role in the PD estimates are several other
mortgage loan characteristics, borrower characteristics and payment performance information. The
PD scale is based on a continuous scale ranging from 0-100%.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 283
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The validation of these estimates is performed on historical data and is carried out annually. For the
PD, the estimates are back tested against realised defaults and realised losses. In this way, it is ensured
that the model functions correctly in a changing economic environment. Moreover, NIBC is closely
following recent regulatory proposals regarding the adjusted capital requirements under standardised
approach and introducing of capital floors also known as Basel IV.
Table 57-24 shows the PD distribution of the Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2018
and 31 December 2017. A PD of 100% means that a borrower is close to or more than 90 days in
arrears.

1 Excluding buy-to-let mortgages
Impairment amounts under IFRS9 or Expected Credit Losses (ECL) are calculated on individual
residential mortgage loans.
For ECL for mortgages the staging can be summarised as follows:
■ Stage 1 – For newly originated loans and loans with no significant increase in their credit risk, the
ECL is determined on a 12-month horizon;
■ Stage 2 – For loans with a significant increase in credit risk (SICR), ECL is determined on a lifetime
basis.
■ Stage 3 - For defaulted loans the ECL is determined on a lifetime basis and based on facility-
specific cash flow scenarios. The expected loss is measured as the difference between the
exposure at default and the sale proceeds of the collateral through private sale or auction.
Taking into account probability weighted scenarios for the forward looking macro economy, the ECL
per individual mortgage loan consists of three risk parameters:
■ Point-in-time PD of the borrower, which is an estimate of the default rate over any specified
horizon based on the current state of the credit cycle and the anticipated macroeconomic
scenarios. 
■ Point-in-time LGD, defined as the unbiased loss estimate at a future default date, which takes into
account the presence and the value of collateral;
■ Point-in-Time EAD, which is the estimation of the exposure at a future default date, taking into
account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments and
prepayments of principal and interest and arrears
Risk mitigation and collateral management Dutch Mortgage loans
Credit losses are mitigated in a number of ways:
■ The underlying property is pledged as collateral;
284 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ 29% of the Dutch Own Book portfolio and 8% of the Securitised portfolio are covered by the
NHG programme; 
■ For the part of the Dutch portfolio that has been securitised, credit losses higher than the retained
positions, excess spread and reserve accounts are attributable to investors in the securitisation
programmes.
For the portfolio not covered by the NHG programme, the underlying property is the primary
collateral for any mortgage loan granted, though savings, life insurance and investment deposits may
also serve as additional collateral.
An indicator for potential losses, taking into account indexation of house prices and seasoning, is the
Loan-to-Indexed-Market-Value (LTIMV). The indexation is made by using the CBS/Kadaster index,
which is based on market observables. The Kadaster (national property register) is a public
government register of real estate and their vested rights (e.g. ownership and mortgages). This
register contains transaction data as well as CBS (Statistics Netherlands) data, which are used to
construct a pricing index. Graphs 57-25 and 57-26 show a breakdown of the LTIMV for the total
Dutch Mortgage loan portfolio at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017. The average
seasoning of the total portfolio is approximately 7 years, 2% of the total portfolio has an LTIMV
above 100%. For the remainder of the portfolio, the indexed collateral value is less than or equal to
the nominal loan balance outstanding or is a NHG guaranteed mortgage.

German Mortgage loan portfolio
The German Mortgage loan portfolio amounted to EUR 29 million at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 53 million). The collateral value of this portfolio amounted to
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 285
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
EUR 57 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 95 million). The majority of this
portfolio was acquired from third parties via two portfolio purchases. The purchased portfolios
contain highly seasoned loans with low LTMV.
As is the case in the Netherlands, the underlying property is the primary collateral for the granted
mortgage loan. The majority of mortgage loans in Germany contain an annuity debt profile, leading
to a lower outstanding balance during the lifetime of the loan.
Debt investments
NIBC defines credit risk in debt investments as issuer risk, which is the credit risk of losing the
principal amount on products such as bonds. Issuer risk is calculated based on the book value.
Risk monitoring and measurement
Risk is controlled by setting single issuer limits and, in some cases, programme limits. All single issuer
limits are approved by the TC or by delegated authority to the FMCR department. Apart from single
issuer limits, risk is also monitored by assessing credit spread risk. Both sensitivity analysis (basis point
values, BPVs) and Value at Risk (VaR) numbers are used2.
Note 58 on Market Risk contains more information on these variables.
In the remainder of this section, the exposure has been divided into the following two sub-portfolios:
■ Debt from financial institutions, corporate entities and sovereigns; and
■ Securitisations.
Debt from financial institutions and corporate entities
NIBC invests in debt (bonds) issued by financial institutions and corporate entities. The size of this
sub-portfolio decreased in the course of 2018 to EUR 248 million at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 324 million). Of the total exposure, 39% (31 December 2017: 30%) were
covered bonds. The remaining 61% (31 December 2017: 70%) was senior unsecured debt.
In 2014, NIBC began to use internal ratings to assess the creditworthiness of a financial institution. In
general debt investments are rated more conservative by NIBC than by the external rating agencies.
The amount of EUR 248 million at 31 December 2018 represents the maximum credit risk exposure,
without taking into account the presence of any collateral that could be repossessed in case of
default. The portfolio did not contain any credit default swap exposures.

At both 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, the portfolio of debt from financial institutions
and corporate entities had no credit losses and contained no arrears.
Securitisations
NIBC has been an active participant on the securitisation market in the past decade, both as an
originator and investor in securitisations.
Tables 57-29 and 57-30 present an overview of NIBC’s total securitisation exposure resulting from its
activities as investor in securitisations. The exposure relating to NIBC’s activities as an originator can
be split into exposures related to consolidated and non-consolidated securitisations. If a securitisation
programme is consolidated on NIBC’s balance sheet, the exposure to the underlying collateral is
excluded from the securitisation exposure and included in the total exposures presented in note 57
on credit risk in the corporate loans or mortgage loans sections. NIBC’s total exposure as an
originator to consolidated securitisations was EUR 215 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December
2017: EUR 206 million).
NIBC distinguishes two Securitisation sub-portfolios: the portfolio of Western European
Securitisations and the Liquidity Investments portfolio.
NIBC’s total securitisation exposure (investor and non-consolidated originator) increased to
EUR 577 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 498 million), mainly due to an
increase of the Liquidity portfolio.
The portfolio of investments in Western European securitisations contains NIBC’s investor
securitisations in Western Europe as well as all investments in NIBC’s own non-consolidated
securitisations. All investments in NIBC’s own securitisations are subject to approval from both Risk
Management and Finance. The total amount of the portfolio of investments in Western Europe
decreased to EUR 65 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 74 million). The
Liquidity Investments portfolio was set up to invest part of NIBC’s excess liquidity in the securitisation
market. Investments are in majority AAA rated RMBS transactions backed by Dutch collateral or
European ABS and are eligible to be pledged as collateral with the European Central Bank (ECB).
Apart from the strict mandate, each investment is pre-approved by FMCR. Exposure in this portfolio
increased to EUR 512 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 424 million). The
underlying assets in the collateral pools of NIBC’s securitisation investments comprise Dutch
residential mortgage loans (NL-RMBS AAA Liquidity Portfolio) and French and German car loans and
credit card receivables (EU-ABS AAA Liquidity Portfolio).

Geographic distribution of securitisations
Graph 57-31 presents the distribution of the Securitisations portfolio by geographic region at
31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017. NIBC allocates exposure to a region based on the
geographic location in which the cash flows are generated. The geographic distribution illustrates that
the majority of these assets are located in Western Europe, mainly in the Netherlands (62%),
Germany (14%) and the United Kingdom (5%). NIBC’s exposure in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal is
limited and had decreased to EUR 5 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
EUR 18 million). Approximately 94% of this exposure is investment grade exposure. NIBC had no
exposure in Greece at 31 December 2018 or 2017.

Expected credit losses on securitisations
The majority of the Securitisations portfolio is reported at amortised cost or Fair Value for
accounting purposes and the respective assets are subject to a quarterly credit-impaired analysis.
Expected credit losses related to stage 3 are taken when the expected future cashflows are
insufficient to meet the payment obligations. The stock of IFRS 9 stage 3 credit losses decreased to
EUR 0.5 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 1 million IAS 39 impairments).

Cash management
NIBC is exposed to credit risk as a result of cash management activities. In 2018, NIBC’s risk
management framework for cash management continued its conservative approach, taking into
account the vulnerable financial markets.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 289
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk monitoring and measurement
NIBC places its excess cash with the DNB/Dutch State Treasury Agency and with a selected number
of investment-grade financial institutions. A monitoring process is in place within the FMCR
department for the approved financial institutions. Cash management exposures can be collateralised
through reverse repo transactions or unsecured through interbank deposits and current accounts.
Correspondent banking and third-party account providers
Apart from the exposure in cash management, NIBC holds foreign currency accounts at
correspondent banks and also utilises third-party account providers for internal securitisations.
Exposures
At 31 December 2018, NIBC’s total cash amounted EUR 2,601 million (31 December 2017:
EUR 2,021 million). EUR 2,169 million of the cash was held at DNB and Deutsche Bundesbank,
EUR 432 million at financial institutions and no exposure at corporate entities (securitisation-related
liquidity facilities).

At year-end 2018, EUR 155 million cash collateral has been excluded from the cash management
exposure (year-end 2017: EUR 627 million) as this amount is restricted cash that relates to
derivatives with a negative fair value. At both 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, this
portfolio carried no impairments and no arrears.
Credit risk in derivatives
Credit risk in derivatives is the risk of having to replace the counterparty in derivative contracts.
NIBC’s credit risk in derivatives can be split into exposures to financial institutions and corporate
entities. NIBC’s policy is to minimise this risk. NIBC only enters into OTC contracts with central
clearing counterparties and financial institutions that are investment grade or with corporate entities
where the exposure is secured by some form of collateral.
Risk monitoring and measurement
Credit risk in derivatives is based on the marked-to-market value and Potential Future Exposure (PFE)
of the derivative. The PFE reflects a potential future change in marked-to- market value during the
290 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
remaining lifetime of the derivative contract. For financial institutions, separate limits for credit risk are
in place, based on the external rating. For corporate clients, NIBC enters into a derivative transaction
as part of its overall relationship with the client. The credit approval process for these derivatives is
closely linked with the credit approval process of the loan. Limit-setting proposals for both financial
institutions and corporate counterparties are reviewed in the TC. For financial institutions, collateral
postings under a CSA are taken into account. In 2018 NIBC offsetted assets and liabilities with central
clearing members. Derivatives with the same characteristics, being counterparty, maturity bucket and
currency are netted. In 2018, EUR 2 million of NIBC’s derivative portfolio including netting, but
excluding collateral and PFE has been centrally cleared. For corporate counterparties, both the loan
and derivative are treated as a single package whereby the derivative often benefits from the security/
collateral supporting the loan exposure.
Exposures
Tables 57-36 and 57-37 display NIBC exposures from credit risk in derivatives allocated across the
rating class of the underlying counterparty. Exposure is the sum of the positive marked-to-market
value of derivative contracts, excluding the effect of netting and collateral exchange. The total
derivative exposure excluding netting and collateral decreased in 2018 to EUR 578 million at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 1,023 million). This decrease can be explained by the
fact that during 2018, NIBC has conversed its cleared interest rate swap (IRS) positions from
collateralised-to-market (CTM) to settled-to-market (STM). From an accounting perspective, this
means that changes in the value of the IRS positions are no longer paid and received in a collateral
account reflecting the total marked-to-market (MTM), but rather daily changes are settled in the cash
account. This conversion leads to a shortening of the balance sheet.

Collateral
To the extent possible, NIBC attempts to limit credit risk arising from derivatives. NIBC enters into
bilateral collateral agreements with financial institutions to mitigate credit risk in OTC derivatives by
means of CSAs. Positive marked-to-market values can be netted with negative marked-to-market
values and the remaining exposure is mitigated through bilateral collateral settlements (as in tables
57-38 and 57-39). Accepted collateral is mainly cash collateral, which is usually exchanged on a daily
basis. The primary counterparties in these CSAs are large international banks with ratings of A or
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 291
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
higher. NIBC generally carries out daily cash collateral exchanges to account for changes in the
market value of the contracts included in the CSA.
Terms and conditions of these CSAs are in line with general International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) credit support documents. Collateral from CSAs significantly decreases the credit
exposure on derivatives, as presented in table 57-38 at 31 December 2018 and in table 57-39 at
December 2017.

Valuation of corporate derivatives (credit and debt value adjustments)
CVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the risk of default of the
counterparty as well as the own default risk of NIBC. The adjustments are applied to all OTC
derivative contracts, except for those that benefit from a solid collateral agreement where cash
collateral is regularly exchanged, mitigating the credit risk. In practice, this means that CVA and DVA
are only applied to OTC derivative contracts that generate credit risk on corporate (i.e. non-financial)
counterparties.
Arrears
NIBC applies a threshold for determining whether a derivative carries a non-material arrear. The
criteria for this threshold are the same as for the portfolio of corporate loans. If amounts in arrear fall
below the threshold (EUR 100,000), they are considered insignificant and are therefore excluded.
The application of the threshold does not influence the total arrears for 2018 and 2017.
Table 57-40 displays an overview of the arrears for corporate derivatives at 31 December 2018 and
31 December 2017 as well as the exposures (marked-to-market values) these arrears refer to. There
were no amounts in arrear for derivatives with financial institutions. As shown in Table 57-40, at
31 December 2018, no marked-to-market exposure in arrear (31 December 2017: no marked-to-
market exposure in arrear).

Interest rate risk in the Banking book
NIBC defines interest rate risk in the Banking book (IRRBB) as the risk of losses from interest rate
sensitive positions in non-trading activities due to movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is
measured both from an economic value perspective and an earnings perspective. The first
perspective considers the impact on the market value, while the latter considers the impact on the
net interest income.
NIBC’s banking book consists of:
■ Corporate treasury
■ Commercial Treasury
■ Corporate banking
■ Retail banking
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for IRRBB from an economic value perspective is measured by the modified
duration of equity and equal to 5 (with a tolerance of 7.5), while the risk appetite from an earnings
perspective is measured by the impact on 1Y earnings and equal to EUR 18 million (assuming a shift
in interest rates of 100 bps).
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest Basis Point Value (BPV) and interest Value at Risk (VaR) measures are
calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the Market Risk department:
■ Interest BPV measures the sensitivity of the market value to an instantaneous change of one basis
point in each time bucket of the interest rate curve. The BPV as displayed in the tables below
represents the sensitivity of the market value to a one-basis-point, parallel upward shift of the
underlying curve;
■ The interest VaR measures the threshold value, which daily marked-to-market losses with a
confidence level of 99% will not exceed, based on four years of historical data for weekly changes
in interest rates. These weekly changes are superimposed on the current market rates. The VaR is
calculated by means of full valuation to take non-linearity into account.
From the earnings perspective changes in interest rates occur both instantaneously and gradually over
time. The combination of static and dynamic (changes to the current portfolio composition) analyses
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 293
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
are used. The dynamic analysis allows the integration of the business strategy in the earnings, by
aligning the development of the balance sheet with the business plan, taking into account both
refinancing and reinvestments. Earnings at risk (EaR) is calculated by means of the following measure:
■ 12 months earnings impact due to a 200 bps gradual upwards or downwards interest rate shock
per currency
EaR as displayed in the tables below represents the 200 bps gradual upwards measure.
The interest rate risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as
stress testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future
events.
Limits are set on the above measures, both those from the economic value perspective and from an
earnings perspective. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once every two weeks.
Any major breach of IRRBB limits is reported to the CRO immediately.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk in the Banking book
Interest rate risk in the Banking book from an economic value perspective is mainly present in the
Mismatch book and the Mortgages book; note that the books have opposite interest rate risk
positions from an economic value perspective.
NIBC accepts a certain economic value risk exposure in the Mismatch book to stabilise earnings. We
call this our strategic mismatch exposure. If we would not have this exposure and hedge all our
interest bearing assets and liabilities to 3-months Euribor/Libor, our (non-interest bearing) capital will
effectively be financing very short-term assets and the interest return on our (non-interest bearing)
capital will fluctuate with these short term rates earned on those assets.
The Mismatch book exclusively contains swaps in EUR and GBP as these are, next to USD, the major
currencies in which also lending activities take place. The Mismatch book contained no USD position
in 2018. At year-end of 2018 the total notional position is EUR 511 million, with 69% of the mismatch
position held in EUR, 31% in GBP and 0% in USD. Duration based the relative positions would be
77% in EUR, 23% in GBP, 0% in USD.
The Mortgage loan book consists of:
■ The White Label portfolio which has a size of 4.0 billion EUR at year-end 2018; with 29 million
EUR in Germany.
■ The NIBC Direct portfolio, which was launched in 2013 and has significantly grown since then. At
year-end 2017 this portfolio’s size was EUR 4.4 billion and at year-end 2018 the size of this
portfolio is EUR 5.2 billion.
The mortgages portfolios are accounted on amortised cost and notional hedging is applied to hedge
the interest rate risk.
However the interest rate sensitivity (from an economic value perspective) of both books is
measured identically, i.e. by taking into account a discount spread.

58 Market risk
NIBC defines market risk as:
■ the risk of losses in the Trading book arising from adverse movements in market rates and;
■ the risk of losses in the Banking Book from NIBC’s credit spread risk position and;
■ the risk of losses in both the banking and trading book from adverse movements in currencies
with respect to the Euro.
The predominant market risk drivers for NIBC are interest rate risk and credit spread risk .
In Money Markets & Trading, NIBC takes short-term positions in the EUR, GBP and USD yield
curves. This book also contains interest rate risk related to derivative transactions of NIBC’s clients.
All positions within NIBC Markets are part of the Trading book. The Trading book of NIBC Markets
contains bonds and a relatively small equity portfolio in those equities, for which NIBC markets is
liquidity provider.
Risk appetite
The risk appetite for market risk is moderate. For all market risk types limits are set and monitored
on a daily basis.
Risk monitoring and measurement
From an economic value perspective the impact of an instantaneous shift in interest rates on a static
portfolio is considered. Interest and credit spread Basis Point Value (BPV) and interest and credit
spread and equity Value at Risk (VaR) measures are calculated on a daily basis and reviewed by the
Market Risk department. VaR is calculated using 4 years of historical data and a confidence level of
99%.
The market risk analysis is complemented by a set of scenarios, including scenarios intended as stress
testing and vulnerability identification, both based on historical events and on possible future events.
Limits are set on the above measures. The limits and utilisation are reported to the ALCO once
every two weeks. Any major breach of market risk limits is reported to the CRO immediately.

Currency risk
NIBC manages its overall currency position based on the currency positions in the monthly balance
sheets. The main exposures in foreign currencies for NIBC are USD, GBP and JPY. NIBC uses
matched funding and other measures to apply its policy of not taking any currency positions. Any
currency position which does show at month end is caused by movements in the fair value of assets
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 297
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
or liabilities or interest income in foreign currencies and is hedged by entering into FX spot
transactions. The total open foreign currency position, by nominal amount, was EUR 5.7 million at
year-end 2018. This currency position is the position prior to hedging, which is always done shortly
after month-end. Regulatory capital for currency risk is equal to 0.4 million EUR per end of 2018.
Furthermore, the impact of a reasonably possible yearly change (in absolute terms) of EUR against
other currencies was calculated. Per end of 2018 the impact of these reasonably possible changes is
as follows for NIBC Holding (only currencies with the larger exposures are displayed).

59 Liquidity risk
NIBC defines liquidity risk as the inability of NIBC to fund its assets and meet its obligations as they
become due, at acceptable cost.
Maintaining a sound liquidity and funding profile is one of NIBC’s most important risk management
objectives. NIBC analyses its funding profile by mapping all assets and liabilities into time buckets that
correspond to their maturities. Based on projections prepared by the business units and reviewed by
Risk Management, and the current asset and liability maturity profiles, several liquidity stress tests are
prepared and presented once every two weeks to the ALCO, in order to create continuous
monitoring of the liquidity position.
Assumptions
One of the stress scenarios, the market-wide stress test, assumes a world-wide liquidity shortage in
which no new market funding can be attracted by NIBC. Furthermore, it is assumed that assets
cannot be sold, but that they can only be made liquid by making them eligible for collateralised and
ECB funding. In addition, the following assumptions are made:
■ In order to maintain NIBC’s business franchise, it is assumed that new corporate loan production
continues at a level where the current books are maintained constant;
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to for example collateral cash outflows (payments from
CSAs) and drawdowns of undrawn commitments are made; and
■ A one notch downgrade is assumed.
The projection of NIBC’s liquidity in this way is necessarily a subjective process and requires
management to make assumptions about, for example, the fair value of eligible collateral and
potential outflow of cash collateral placed by NIBC with derivative counterparties.
In light of these projections, NIBC is confident that sufficient liquidity is available to meet maturing
obligations over the next 12 months.
298 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Maturity calendar consolidated balance sheet
The following tables present the cash flows payable by NIBC in respect of non-derivative financial
liabilities relevant for liquidity risk by the remaining contractual maturities at 31 December. The
amounts disclosed in the tables for the non-derivative financial liabilities are contractual future
undiscounted cash flows. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are therefore restated
to future nominal amounts. The financial assets relevant for managing liquidity risk are based on the
fair value (discounted cash flows) for those assets which are classified at FVOCI.
The differences between the table and the stress scenario are caused mainly by the following items
that are included in the stress scenario analysis but not in the maturity calendar of the consolidated
balance sheet:
■ New asset production;
■ Collateralised funding capacity of internal securitisations and individual bonds; and
■ Conservative assumptions with respect to possible cash outflows (e.g. CSA collateral, callable
funding).

60 Capital management
Overview
It is NIBC’s policy to maintain a strong capital base, to meet regulatory capital requirements at all
times and to support the development of its business by allocating capital efficiently. Allocation of
capital to the business is based on an EC approach. EC is the amount of capital which NIBC allocates
as a buffer against potential losses from business activities, based upon its assessment of risks. The EC
that NIBC allocates to each business is based on the assessment of risk of its activities. It differs from
the CRR/CRDIV capital requirements, i.e. regulatory capital, as in certain cases NIBC assesses the
specific risk characteristics of its business activities in a different way than the CRR/CRDIV method.
Total regulatory capital however, in combination with a minimum benchmark Tier 1 ratio, does form
a limit to the maximum amount of EC that can be allocated to the business.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 303
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Comparing the risk-based EC of each business to its profit delivers a RAROC for each business. EC
and RAROC are key tools in NIBC's capital allocation and usage process, assisting in allocating Own
Funds as efficiently as possible, based on expectations of both risks and return. Usage of EC is
assessed once every two weeks in the ALCO. The ALCO resets the maximum allocation level of EC
to and within each business, taking into account business expectations, NIBC's desired risk profile and
the regulatory requirements.
Methodology
NIBC uses the business model of each activity as the basis for determining the EC. If the business
model of an activity is trading, distribution or investing for a limited period, a market risk approach
based upon VaR and scaled to a one-year horizon is used to calculate the EC usage. A business
model based on 'buy-to-hold' or investing to maturity leads to a credit risk approach being applied,
based upon estimations of PD and LGD. Add-ons for operational risk and country risk are also
calculated. Furthermore, NIBC allocates EC for business risk, reputation risk and model risk on a
group-wide level.
The EC approach differs from the CRR/CRDIV approach in which only the trading books are
assigned a market risk approach. In the CRR/CRDIV framework, activities that are not trading but
have a business model based on distribution or investment for a limited period are often assigned a
credit risk approach, following CRR/CRDIV regulations or regulatory industry practice, whereas in the
EC framework NIBC applies a market risk approach similar to that of the trading activities. Risks and
EC are monitored accordingly.
The main differences between the EC capital and CRR/CRDIV framework come from the Residential
Mortgage portfolio, the Securitisations portfolio and NIBC’s interest rate mismatch position. EC is
determined by a market risk approach for these activities. The CRR/CRDIV approach is either a
credit risk approach (mortgage loans and securitisations) or is not part of the CRR/CRD IV Pillar 1 at
all (mismatch position).
Capital allocation
NIBC allocates EC to all its business activities in the form of limits set by the ALCO and calculates the
amount of EC usage of each business based on the risk of its activities:
■ For the Corporate Loan portfolio, NIBC calculates EC usage by means of a credit risk approach
largely based upon the CRR regulatory capital formula and an add-on for concentration risk;
■ For the Debt Investments and Trading portfolios, the Residential Mortgage portfolio and the
interest rate mismatch position, NIBC uses a market risk approach to determine EC usage. EC
usage for these portfolios is calculated using VaR, calculated with four years of historical data and
scaled to a one-year horizon;
■ For the Investment loans, NIBC calculates EC usage by applying a credit approach based upon the
CRR regulatory capital formula. NIBC uses fixed percentages for the equity investments.
CRR/CRDIV regulatory capital
The objective of CRR/CRDIV is to enhance the capital adequacy of the banking industry by making it
more responsive to risk. CRR/CRDIV is structured on three pillars:
■ Pillar 1 describes the capital adequacy requirements for three risk types; credit risk, market risk and
operational risk;
■ Pillar 2 describes the additional supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), where regulators
analyse the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) of the individual banks. Since the
end of 2011, Dutch Central Bank also analyses the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process
(ILAAP);
304 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
■ In Pillar 3 the required risk reporting standards are displayed, supporting additional market
discipline in the international capital markets.
Under CRR/CRDIV and subject to approval from the regulator, banks have the option to choose
between various approaches, each with a different level of sophistication in risk management, ranging
from ‘standardised’ to ‘advanced’.
For credit risk, NIBC adopted the AIRB approach as further specified in CRR/CRDIV for its
corporate, retail and institutional exposure classes. NIBC started using the AIRB approach at
1 January 2008. A small residue of exposures is measured on the standardised approach.
For market risk, NIBC adopted an internal model VaR approach.
For measuring operational risk, NIBC adopted the standardised approach, which is based on
prescribed business-line activities.
The basis for Pillar 2 is NIBC’s ICAAP, which is NIBC’s self-assessment of risks sufficiently captured by
Pillar 1, i.e. the link between NIBC's risk profile, its risk management and risk mitigation, and NIBC's
capital planning.
Under Pillar 3, NIBC publishes its regulatory disclosures regarding its capital structure, capital
adequacy, liquidity risk, risk management objectives/policies and risk-weighted assets each year. The
Pillar 3 disclosures are published on the same date as the Annual Report on our website.
The following table displays the composition of regulatory capital as at 31 December 2018 and
31 December 2017.The regulatory capital is based on the CRR/CRDIV scope of consolidation,
calculated for NIBC Bank consolidated on a fully loaded base and including the full year profit after of
the year. The full year profit after tax is included without permission of DNB. NIBC Bank complies
with the CRR/CRDIV capital requirements, which formally requires a minimum Common Equity ratio
(including capital buffer) of 9.75%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio (including capital buffer) of 11.25% and a
minimum Total Capital ratio (including capital buffer) of 13.50%.

COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the company financial statements are
set out in the consolidated financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all
the years presented, unless otherwise stated. Where necessary, comparative figures have been
adjusted to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.
The company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements for
financial statements contained in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. NIBC applies the
provisions in Section 362, paragraph 8, Title 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code that make it
possible to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies
(including those for the presentation of financial instruments as equity or liability) used in its
consolidated financial statements.
The company financial statements are presented in euros rounded to the nearest million. The euro is
the functional and presentation currency of NIBC .
Summary of significant accounting policies
Except as set forth below, the accounting policies applied in the company financial statements are the
same as those for the consolidated financial statements.
Interests in group companies
Interests in group companies, as defined in the Subsidiaries section in the basis of consolidation in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements, are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is
determined by measuring the assets, provisions, liabilities and income based on the accounting
policies used in the consolidated financial statements. The company’s share of its group companies
profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. The bank applies paragraph 107a of the
Dutch Accounting Standard 100. Under this paragraph the bank eliminates the expected credit losses
on loans to subsidiaries in the same line item.
If losses of group companies that are attributable to the company exceed the carrying amount of the
interest in the group company (including separately presented goodwill, if any, and including other
unsecured receivables), further losses are not recognised unless the company has incurred obligations
or made payments on behalf of the group company to satisfy obligations of the group company. In
such a situation, NIBC recognises a provision up to the extent of its obligation.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For a specification of segment information, please see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
1 Net interest income
Interest income consists of interest income on loans and advances to customers, interest-bearing
securities and other interest and similar income.
Interest expense consists of interest expense on liabilities, whether or not embodied in debt
securities, and derivatives, as well as commissions having an interest nature, penalty interest on early
redemptions, premiums and discounts. Premiums and discounts on debts, whether or not embodied
in debt securities, not stated at fair value are recognised using the effective interest method, together
with the relevant interest expense.

The interest income includes a positive amount of EUR 5 million related to the Targeted Long-Term
Refinancing Operations programme (TLTRO II) of the ECB, as NIBC expects to meet the minimum
net lending amount in the reference period, needed to receive the applicable discount rate of 40bps.
Interest income includes negative interest from liabilities for an amount of EUR 28 million (2017:
EUR 35 million).
For the year ended 31 December 2018, interest expense related to deposits from customers
amounted to EUR 88 million (31 December 2017: EUR 113 million).

Fair value hedges of interest rate risk
The interest rate risk of financial assets with a fixed interest rate classified at available-for-sale or at
amortised costs are hedged with interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a fixed rate and
receives floating rates. Fair value hedge accounting is applied to these hedge relationships.
Interest rate swaps under which NIBC pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate are used in fair
value hedges of fixed-interest rate liabilities (as far as not held for trading purposes or designated at
fair value through profit or loss).
The following table discloses the fair value of the swaps designated in fair value hedging relationships:

Balance at 31 December 2 6
The deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured for all temporary differences using the liability
method. The effective tax rate in the Netherlands for measuring deferred tax is 25% (2017: 25%).
There were no changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in the effective tax
rate in the Netherlands. Deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carry forward losses can only be
utilized if taxable profits are realised in the future. To measure deferred tax assets, NIBC takes a
prudent approach regarding future compensation of carry forward losses. On 31 December 2018
there was a realistic expectation that sufficient taxable profits would be generated within the
applicable periods for the recognised deferred tax asset.

27 Commitments and contingent assets and liabilities
At any time, NIBC has outstanding commitments to extend credit. Outstanding loan commitments
have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement
period of one to three months. Commitments extended to customers related to mortgages at fixed-
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 337
COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
interest rates or fixed spreads are hedged with interest rate swaps recorded at fair value. These
commitments are designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
NIBC provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers
to third parties. These agreements have fixed limits and generally extend for a period of up to five
years. Expirations are not concentrated in any period.
The contractual amounts of commitments and contingent liabilities are set out in the following table
by category. In the following table, it is assumed that amounts are fully advanced.
The amounts for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum accounting loss that would
be recognised at the balance sheet date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted.

Contract amount:
Undrawn facilities and capital commitments 1,537 1,377
Guarantees and letters of credit 84 70
1,621 1,447
These commitments and contingent liabilities have off-balance sheet credit risk because only
commitment/origination fees and accruals for probable losses are recognised in the balance sheet
until the commitments are fulfilled or expire. Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments will
expire without being advanced in whole or in part. Therefore, the amounts do not represent
expected future cash flows.
Details of concentrations of credit risk including concentrations of credit risk arising from
commitments and contingent liabilities as well as NIBC's policies for collateral for loans are set out in
note 50 of the consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees within the meaning of Section 403 Title 9 of Book 2, of the Netherlands Civil Code have
been given on behalf of De Nationale Maatschappij voor Industriële Financieringen B.V., Parnib
Holding N.V. and B.V. NIBC Mortgage Backed Assets. A complete list of the companies on behalf of
which NIBC has given guarantees within the meaning of Section 403 Title 9 of Book 2, of the
Netherlands Civil Code has been filed with the Chamber of Commerce in The Hague.

Basis for our opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements” section of our report. 
 
We are independent of NIBC Bank N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding 
statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision 
act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for 
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations 
in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants 
(VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 
 
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Materiality 
Materiality  €13 million (2017: €12 million) 
Benchmark applied  5% of profit before taxation (2017: 5%) 
Explanation  This benchmark is a generally accepted auditing practice and is widely used for listed 
entities. Based on our professional judgment regarding the common information needs 
of users of the financial statements, we believe that 5% of profit before taxation is an 
appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality. 
 
We have also taken misstatements into account and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for 
the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. 
 
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of €0.65 million which are identified during the 
audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative 
grounds. 
Scope of the group audit 
NIBC comprises of multiple components. The financial information of these components is included in the 
consolidated financial statements of NIBC. NIBC is structured in operating segments: Corporate client segment, 
Retail client segment and Treasury and group functions. Corporate client offering is focused on mid-sized companies 
and entrepreneurs in the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Retail client savings products are offered 
in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, and mortgage loans are offered in the Netherlands. 
 
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing 
the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried 
out for components. Our group audit focused on components based on its size and risk. This resulted in a coverage 
of 97% of profit before taxation and 99% of total assets. 
 
The component in Germany, focusing on the Corporate client segment, is audited by an EY member firm. We sent 
detailed instructions to the component auditor, covering significant areas including the relevant risks of material 
misstatement and set out the information required to be reported to the group audit team. We visited the German 
component and had calls with the auditor in which we discussed the planning, risk assessment, procedures 
performed, findings and observations reported to the group auditor. 
 
By performing the procedures mentioned above at components, together with additional procedures at group 
level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial 
information to provide an opinion on the financial statements. 
Our key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters 
are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. 
 
With regards to the key audit matters in our auditor’s report compared to those reported in 2017, we determined 
that the implementation of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in 2018 was a key audit matter given the complexity of 
(new) models, assumptions and the impact on the opening balance sheet and on the 2018 results. 
 
As part of the IFRS 9 adoption, NIBC reclassified the residential mortgages portfolio from fair value through profit 
and loss to amortized cost. As such, we no longer consider the fair value measurement of this portfolio a key audit 
matter. Further, due to reduced estimation uncertainty, we no longer consider the recognition of deferred tax assets 
for carry forward losses a key audit matter. 
 
 
   
342 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  
 
IFRS 9 adoption and impairment of corporate loans 
Key audit matter  On 1 January 2018, NIBC adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which replaced IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.  
 
The implementation of IFRS 9 negatively impacted 2018 opening shareholders’ equity by €260 
million. The impact was mainly driven by NIBC’s decision to revise the accounting classification 
and measurement of residential mortgages at fair value through profit and loss to amortized cost. 
In accordance with the IFRS 9 transition provisions, the 2017 comparative information has not 
been restated. As a result, the 2018 and 2017 financial statements are not comparable in this 
respect. 
 
At 31 December 2018, NIBC reported Loans (amortised cost) of €7,770 billion and a provision of 
€163 million for expected credit losses. The timing and measurement of expected credit losses 
requires significant estimates and  judgment in setting assumptions in respect of: 
-  Allocation of corporate loans to stages 1, 2 and 3; 
-  Accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models to 
calculate the expected credit loss (ECL); 
-  Completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate the ECL; 
-  Inputs and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple macro-economic 
scenarios to calculate the ECL for stages 1 and 2; 
-  Measurement of individually assessed provisions, including the assessment of multiple 
recovery scenarios; 
-  Accuracy and adequacy of financial statement disclosures. 
 
Due to the significance of the corporate loan portfolio and the related estimation uncertainty of 
expected credit losses, we consider the measurement of the provision for expected credit losses 
as a key audit matter. Refer to the “Summary of significant accounting policies” section, the 
“Critical accounting estimates and judgments” section, note 27 “Loans (amortized cost)” and note 
57 “Credit risk” to the financial statements. 
Our audit approach  As IFRS 9 was adopted as of 2018, we performed audit procedures on the opening balances to 
gain assurance on the transition from IAS 39. This included evaluating the accounting 
interpretations for compliance with IFRS 9 and testing the adjustments and disclosures made on 
transition. 
 
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls across the processes relevant to 
the ECL. This included the allocation of assets into stages, model governance, data accuracy and 
completeness, credit monitoring, multiple economic scenarios, individual provisions, journal 
entries and disclosures. 
 
We performed an overall assessment of the ECL provision levels by stage to determine if they are 
reasonable considering the NIBC’s portfolio, risk profile, credit risk management practices and 
macroeconomic environment. We considered trends in the economy and industries to which NIBC 
is exposed. 
 
We challenged the criteria used to allocate corporate loans to stage 1, 2, or 3 in accordance with 
IFRS 9. We tested loans in stage 1,2 and 3 and verified whether they were allocated to the 
appropriate stage. 
With the support of our modelling specialists, we tested assumptions, inputs and formulas used in 
a sample of ECL models. This included the appropriateness of model design and formulas used 
and recalculating the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default for a 
sample of models. Further, we assessed  the selected macro-economic scenarios used with the 
support of our economic specialists. 
 
 
   
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 343

We examined a selection of loan exposures to assess the expected credit loss provision for stage 3 
loans. We applied professional judgment in selecting those exposures for our detailed inspection, 
placing an emphasis on portfolios that are potentially more sensitive to developing economic and 
political trends such as leveraged finance, offshore energy and shipping. For selected loan 
exposures we recalculated individually assessed provisions and  challenged the recovery scenarios 
and probability weights assigned.  
 
We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures for compliance with IFRS-EU. 
Our observations  We are satisfied that expected credit loss provisions are reasonable and in compliance with IFRS 
9. We have made recommendations in our 2018 management letter to NIBC’s management and 
the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. Our recommendations relate to designing an 
observable set of credit impairment triggers, evidencing the design and execution of periodic 
review controls and back testing of models for calculating expected credit losses.  
 
We concur with the related disclosures in the financial statements. 
Reliability and continuity of the information technology and systems 
Key audit matter  NIBC is highly dependent on its IT systems and IT infrastructure for the continuity of the 
operations. NIBC continuously invests to further improve its IT environment and IT systems. In 
particular, significant  management attention was paid to outsourcing of various IT services to 
third parties. We therefore consider this as a key audit matter. 
Audit approach  As part of our audit procedures we have assessed the changes in the IT systems and IT 
infrastructure. We have tested the reliability and continuity of electronic data processing within 
the scope of the audit of the 2018 financial statements. For that purpose, we have included IT 
auditors in our team. Our procedures included testing of controls with regards to IT systems and 
processes relevant for financial reporting. 
 
A particular area of attention is related to logical access management, including access rights and 
segregation of duties. We evaluated the impact of changes during the year following the 
(re)migration of applications from and to external service providers. We tested logical access 
rights to the extent relied upon for the audit of the consolidated financial statements. This 
resulted in the identification of certain control deficiencies with respect to access rights, change 
management processes and segregation of duties. We performed procedures over management’s 
remediation activities and additional substantive audit procedures to mitigate the related audit 
risk. 
Our observations  We have made recommendations to management relating to internal controls and governance of 
outsourced applications in our 2018 management letter to NIBC’s management and the Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board. The combination of the tests of controls and the substantive 
tests performed provided sufficient appropriate evidence for the purposes of our audit.

Description of responsibilities for the financial statements 
Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with 
EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal

Page 6  
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management 
should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management 
should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in the financial statements.  
 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. 
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and 
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.  
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all 
material errors and fraud during our audit. 
 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial 
statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the 
effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.  
 
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in 
accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit 
included amongst others: 
•  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control 
•  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
company’s internal control 
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management 
•  Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern 
•  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures 
•  Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation 
 
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and 
performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be

carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On 
this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of 
financial information or specific items. 
 
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our 
audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of 
the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information 
included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report. 
 
We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
 
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters 
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
NIBC uses, throughout its financial publications, alternative performance measures (APMs) in addition
to the figures that are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV). NIBC
uses APMs to provide additional information to investors and to enhance the understanding of the
results. The APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than a substitute for, the figures
determined according to IFRS, CRR and CRD IV. All measures that are covered by IFRS, CRR and
CRD IV are not considered to be APMs.
NIBC uses the following APMs:
■ Dividend payout ratio, %
■ Cost/income ratio, %
■ Return on equity, %
■ Cost of risk, %
■ Impairment ratio, %
■ NPL ratio, %
■ Impairment coverage ratio, %
■ Loan-to-deposit ratio, %
■ Net interest margin, %
Investors should consider that similarly titled APMs reported by other companies may be calculated
differently. For that reason, the comparability of APMs across companies might be limited. In
accordance with the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the
following information is given in regards to the above mentioned alternative performance measures:
1. Definition of the APM;
2. Reconciliation of the APM to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal or total presented in
the financial statements.
NIBC’s most recent financial publications at any time are available online at our website.
Dividend pay-out ratio
The dividend pay-out ratio is the fraction of net income for a period to be paid to NIBC’s
shareholders in dividends. It provides meaningful information on the portion of NIBC’s profit that is
distributed to its shareholders. The elements of the dividend pay-out ratio reconcile to the income
statement of NIBC.

Cost of risk
The cost of risk compares the total credit losses included in the income statement to the total risk
weighted assets. This measure provides meaningful information on Issuer’s performance in managing
credit losses. The cost of risk is calculated as the ratio of (i) the sum of annualised impairments and
the credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans (as part of the net trading income) and
to (ii) the total risk weighted assets averaged over the reporting period. With the exception of the
credit losses on the fair value mortgage loans and loans, the elements of the cost of risk reconcile to

Impairment ratio
The impairment ratio compares impairments included in the income statement on corporate and
retail loans to the carrying value of these loans. The measure provides meaningful information on
NIBC’s performance in managing credit losses arising from its business. The impairment ratio is
calculated as the ratio of (i) the annualised impairment expenses to (ii) the average loans and
mortgage loans. All elements of the impairment ratio reconcile to NIBC’s income statement and the
consolidated balance sheet.

NPL ratio
The non-performing loans (NPL) ratio compares the non-performing exposure (as defined by the
European Banking Authority) of corporate and retail loans to the total exposure of these loans. The
measure provides meaningful information on the credit quality of NIBC’s assets. The ratio is calculated
by dividing the total of non-performing exposure for both corporate loans and mortgage loans by the
total exposure for corporate loans and mortgage loans. The elements of the NPL ratio reconcile to
the consolidated financial statements and the regulatory reporting of NIBC.

Net interest margin
The net interest margin is a measure to display the difference between interest income and the
amount of interest paid out to lenders, relative to the amount of interest-earning assets. It is similar to
the gross margin (or gross profit margin) of non-financial companies and provides meaningful
information on the contribution of Issuer’s business to its operating income. It is calculated as the
ratio of (i) the net interest income from the last 12 months and (ii) the 12 months moving average
interest bearing assets. Interest bearing assets equal the total assets from the consolidated balance
sheet excluding equity investments, derivatives, investments in associates, property, plant and
equipment and other assets. The net interest income reconciles to the income statement of NIBC.
The average interest bearing assets cannot be directly reconciled with the financial publications of
NIBC as the monthly figures are not disclosed, however the monthly figures are prepared in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.
Since the denominator of the net interest margin calculation is subject to volatility in the balance, a
moving average provides more reliable information on the underlying developments. The moving
average however does not tie back to disclosed balances. For reference purposes, the following table
shows the calculation method and the comparative outcome for 2017 when the net interest margin
is calculated on ending balances instead of moving averages.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING SCOPE
This Annual Report is an integrated report. We have chosen to combine all our financial, economic,
social and environmental information into one document because all these factors are integral to
NIBC’s strategy and operations. By providing this additional information we aim to increase
transparency for all of our stakeholders and to allow them to make a more informed assessment of
NIBC and how we are creating and sustaining value.
The non-financial key figures for this report were confirmed by the departments that are responsible
for the data. The reported non-financial key figures were reviewed by Internal Audit. Internal Audit
confirmed that nothing has come to the attention that causes them to believe that the reported non-
financial key figures for NIBC Bank N.V. are inadequately presented, in all material respects, in
accordance with the reporting criteria.
Scope
Unless specified otherwise, this report includes figures and information for NIBC Holding N.V.
(including all international offices and wholly-owned subsidiaries established by NIBC for our business
purposes).
NIBC Bank N.V. is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. The NIBC Bank N.V. Annual Report
contains details of our progress as regards the 10 Global Compact principles.
Criteria
The contents of this Annual Report and the selection of non-financial key figures are based on the
following criteria:
■ Assessment of materiality. We report on NIBC’s strategy and the elements that we have identified
as most relevant for us as a company and for our stakeholders. Please see our Materiality
Assessment report and materiality matrix for an overview of these elements;
■ Legal and regulatory requirements. For NIBC, the principal regulatory requirements are contained
in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Dutch Banking Code and the Dutch Decree on
disclosure of non-financial information (Besluit bekendmaking niet-financiële informatie), which
came into effect on 24 March 2017 as part of the transposition into Dutch law of the EU Non-
Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU, OJEU 201 330). Please see the Corporate Governance
sector for more details.
Accountability and reporting standards
Our non-financial key figures are prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria and guidelines of
the latest Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. We have applied the GRI Standards guidelines at
a 'core' level with no exceptions. The GRI content index and glossary of definitions can be found in
the appendices available on our website.
The methodology used for the calculation of indicators for 2018 is the same as for 2017 unless
otherwise stated in the definitions for non-financial key figures. 
Materiality Assessment
We engaged with our stakeholders to verify the focus of our sustainability strategy and materiality in
reporting. This materiality assessment process and the outcomes are described here and form the
basis for our Annual Report.
356 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
OTHER INFORMATION
Stakeholder consultation confirmed the three most important aspects for stakeholders were client
satisfaction, product responsibility, and stakeholder engagement. Given their importance to
stakeholders, NIBC will focus on in these areas while continuing to prioritize our efforts across the
other aspects which stakeholders found to be most material.

Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 357
OTHER INFORMATION
DEFINITIONS FOR THE NON-FINANCIAL KEY FIGURES
The following definitions have been used for the Non Financial Key Figures presented in NIBC’s
annual report.
NPS
Outcome of Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey with corporate lending and advisory clients, who
executed a (lending) deal/deals with NIBC Corporate Banking during the reporting period, and for
existing lending and advisory clients of NIBC.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our corporate lending and
advisory clients as well as an indicator of stakeholder engagement.
The NPS methodology is a widely used methodology in which scores from 0 to 6 are classified as
'detractor', scores. 7 or 8 are classified as 'passive' and only those scores that are 9 or 10 are
classified as 'promoters'. The result is calculated by the percentage of promoters minus the
percentage of detractors, giving the NPS. The NPS can therefore range from -100% to +100%.
The NPS is measured over a 12 month period, from the 1st December to the 30st November each
year. It takes place in four batches and each respondent weighs the same in the score. It is calculated
over the corporate lending and advisory client base, where we are in direct contact with the client,
excluding distressed asset clients, internal clients and certain legacy clients. In case of multiple deals for
one client, the client is counted once. When the online survey is sent to multiple contact persons for
a client, only the first response is included.
The total population of NIBC corporate clients in scope is 602 clients in the 12 month period. 425
clients fall within the definition described above and were surveyed, 109 responses were received.
NIBC considers this to be representative of the total population. The online surveys are sent by a
third party service provider, which transfers the raw results back to NIBC.
NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction Score
The results of the latest, annual online Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS) for the bank's retail clients,
i.e. NIBC Direct Savings Netherlands (NL, including Mortgages), Belgium (BE) and Germany (GE, also
including Brokerage clients), that was completed in the reporting period.
The digital surveys were conducted in November 2018 through a third party, using a random
selection of NIBC’s new and existing Dutch NIBC Direct Mortgage and Savings clients, Belgian NIBC
Direct Savings clients and German NIBC Direct Savings and Brokerage clients. Clients were selected
based amongst other criteria on country and product. The average scores per country and product
are totaled and divided by the total number of clients in the population. The reported 2017 and
2016 figures are based on a different calculation method where the total number of respondents is
used as the denominator for the calculation.
2018 Score per product: Netherlands Mortgages 8.1; Netherlands Savings 7.7; Germany Savings 7.6;
Germany Brokerage 7.8; Belgium Savings 7.8
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of client satisfaction of our retail clients as well as an
indicator of stakeholder engagement.
358 Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018
OTHER INFORMATION
The population of NIBC Direct Customer Satisfaction survey was approx. 289.000 clients in
November 2018, of which 30.000 have been surveyed (10,000 each country), and around 2.500
responses were received. NIBC considers this to be representative for the population.
% of new Corporate loans screened against sustainability policy framework
New corporate deals which have been assessed for social and environmental risks during the
reporting period. A deal may include one or more underlying facilities with different tenors as part of
a deal or loan structure. Amendments to existing deals are excluded from this figure.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator in regard to transparency. Sustainability impacts and
good corporate governance are among the financial and non-financial aspects taken into
consideration during NIBC’s corporate client engagement and financing decision processes.
Screenings were performed by Corporate Banking account managers as part of NIBC’s ongoing and
mandatory due diligence process using a third party toolkit system.
Number of New clients/transactions with increased sustainability risk assessment
Number of new (potential) clients/transactions for which increased sustainability risks were identified
using a third party toolkit assessment. This does not include monitoring of existing client files with
sustainability risks nor clients for which a sustainability risk assessment has not (yet) been completed
as the transaction is still in an early stage or was cancelled in an early stage.
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of stakeholder engagement on potential sustainability
issues.
In these situations, NIBC performs enhanced sustainability due diligence into potential material
environmental, social, and governance aspects that are of potential concern.
Fines or sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations
Number of significant fines and number of non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with laws and
regulations. The definition is limited to fines from a regulator. This excludes any pending claims and/or
litigation. Significant: values of fine > EUR 10.000 (in line with category 2 and 3 fines of AFM).
Stakeholders view this as a material indicator of regulatory compliance and corporate governance of
NIBC’s own operations and day-to-day business.
NIBC includes non-punitive fines agreed as part of settlement of regular tax audits within its
interpretation of the definition for this indicator.
Number of FTE's end of year
Number of FTE's of NIBC worldwide at the end of the year. Only employees on NIBC's payroll and
having an 'internal' position are accounted for. NIBC Bank N.V. includes all its international offices as
well as NIBC Bank Deutschland AG, though excludes minor participations of the bank.
A Full Time Equivalent (FTE) represents, per employee, the total number of contract hours per week
related to the maximum number of contract hours per week (e.g. 40 hours). This maximum can
differ per NIBC office (depending on local guidelines) and kind of job contract.
Male/female ratio
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year.
Annual Report NIBC Bank N.V. 2018 359
OTHER INFORMATION
The number of males and females is based upon headcount as reported from NIBC's human
resources information management system at the end of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity in the company. NIBC
supports all types of diversity and aspires to further diversify its workplace.
Male/female ratio top management
Percentage of number of male and female for NIBC worldwide, at the end of the year. Top
management consists of management with corporate title 'Director' or 'Managing Director'.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator for gender diversity of top management.
Training expenses per employee
Total of training and education expenses, incurred in the current year based on average headcount
calculated by taking the headcount at the beginning and end of the year. For employees traveling for
training, this includes travel costs and any related expenses.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of the bank’s commitment to employee
development and future employability.
Absenteeism
Absenteeism is the rolling average of the latest absenteeism percentage, annualized for NIBC’s
employees in The Netherlands. The absenteeism percentage is the number of workdays lost to
absenteeism divided by the total number of available workdays, expressed as a percentage. In case of
partial absenteeism, the absenteeism percentage only reflects the actual absenteeism (non-working
hours). Maternity leave is not included in the figure.
Absenteeism rate may change as the year progresses due to previously unreported cases of
absenteeism and/or confirmation of the employee’s recovery.
Notifications of illness and recovery are submitted by NIBC to a 3rd party ARBO service
organization. NIBC uses its 3rd party health & safety services organization to report on absenteeism
figures. The absenteeism percentage relates to the absenteeism in the Netherlands only: absenteeism
in Germany, Belgium and United Kingdom is not accounted for in this figure.
Employee turnover (employees started & left)
Employee turnover consists of inflow of new employees ('started') and outflow of existing employees
('left').
Started: The number of employees that joined NIBC worldwide throughout the current calendar
year (hire date between 1-1-18 and 31-12-18), divided by total number of employees at the start of
the year.
Left: The number of employees that left NIBC worldwide throughout the calendar year divided by
the total number of employees at the start of the year.
Stakeholders view this metric as a material indicator of employee engagement of existing employees
and further as an indicator of the bank’s position as an attractive employer.
