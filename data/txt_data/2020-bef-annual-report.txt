Dear Shareholder,
After the challenges we have all endured over the past year, our Baird Equity Asset Management
team hopes this letter finds you, your families and your loved ones healthy and safe. To say that 2020
was a challenging year for the financial markets and investors truly understates what we have all
experienced. The impact of the coronavirus on our investors’ lives, families, businesses and
communities felt at times overwhelming, but you all persevered and we are honored to have been
your equity manager during this period.
For our Baird Equity Asset Management team, this year has reminded us of the importance of looking
out for each other and remaining laser focused on delivering on your financial needs. We have spent
many years building and refining our equity strategies and I am extremely proud of our team for
navigating the unprecedented challenges in 2020. We not only delivered competitive returns, but also
peace of mind that your equity portfolio was doing what it was supposed to do. Having talented,
experienced teams with time-tested strategies remains a significant competitive advantage. That
expertise and talent was a contributor to the Funds’ competitive performance in 2020.
Amidst this extremely volatile and challenged environment,the MidCap, Small/Mid Cap Growth,
Chautauqua International Growth and Chautauqua Global Growth Funds delivered very strong
absolute performance. Our Value Funds, while lagging in the growth environment, performed as
they should have, particularly with superior downside protection during the March downdraft in the
market. All of the Baird Equity Funds’ long-term track records remain competitive and the portfolios
are positioned well as we enter 2021.
While much in the world has changed, our core commitment to our investors has not. We remain
dedicated to generating competitive, risk-controlled returns over full market cycles, providing
competitively-priced products, delivering outstanding service and continuing to invest in our long-
tenured and seasoned investment team.
Through all of the challenges in 2020, we never lost sight of the fact that our long-term success rests
on the trust you have placed in us to be effective stewards of your assets. We want to express our
sincere appreciation for your confidence in our work and continued investment in the Baird Equity
Funds. May 2021 bring you health, happiness and success.
Sincerely,
Mary Ellen Stanek, CFA
President

December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Portfolio Managers’ Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Baird MidCap Fund Institutional Class posted a total return of
34.81% as compared to 35.59% for the Russell Midcap®Growth Index, the Fund’s benchmark index.
The ability of equity markets to perform so well in 2020 amid a global pandemic and a near full stop of the
economy was rather remarkable, but scientific ingenuity applied to vaccine development and significant
central bank and government stimulus helped offset the devastating impacts of the virus. The Fund’s
positioning entering the year rested on an expectation for continued economic growth. Importantly, our
underlying philosophy of investing in a mix of diversified, high-quality growth businesses helped the Fund
navigate the significant market decline as the pandemic unfolded in March, as well as the sharp market
rebound that followed. The Fund produced a second consecutive year of returns in excess of 30%, and we
were pleased with the performance compared to the benchmark, particularly given favorable results in most
benchmark sectors.
The Fund’s consumer discretionary holdings played a key role in driving relative outperformance. Despite the
pandemic’s significant toll on employment, substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus created enough of a
bridge to carry market expectations beyond the worst of the pandemic’s economic impact. The positive wealth
effect from a strong equity market and rising home prices and increased levels of consumer savings helped
support consumer confidence and spending. Typically, to achieve very strong relative performance in this
sector, it takes good stock picking in several areas, and this was the case in 2020 as the Fund holdings we
selected in diversified retail, home building, leisure, and the restaurant industries performed well. The Fund’s
overweight positioning in the sector relative to the benchmark, based on the favorable fundamentals described
above, also contributed to performance.
The Fund’s returns from investments in the producer durables and materials sectors exceeded benchmark
performance. It is worth grouping these two sectors together given that the prospects of many companies in
both tend to be heavily influenced by changes in the economic cycle. As a result, economic weakness in the
first half of the year challenged the stock performance of many companies in these sectors but returns broadly
improved in the second half. Fund holdings with exposure to areas experiencing increased activity and
spending performed well and included, testing and measurement for the 5G network buildout, trucking, and
power transmission equipment. The standout performer for the Fund in the materials sector was a company
that produces composite decking primarily for residential homes. The overall housing market was strong in
2020 and Fund holdings in companies along the home spending chain, including repair and remodel,
benefitted. The Fund also held several processing and services businesses and their generally more stable
revenue streams held up well amid the market volatility during the year.
As a partial offset to the strength in preceding sectors, the Fund’s technology holdings meaningfully trailed
benchmark performance. Returns were quite strong throughout the sector, particularly in the large software
and services group, leaving little room for stock-selection error. In some respects, the performance headwind
was a matter of style over substance. The technology sector includes an increasing number of high revenue
growth, but unprofitable companies. We view sustainable revenue growth and the ability to generate a profit as
important measures of quality. As a result, profitability is a fundamental characteristic that we require when
selecting investments for the Fund. Unprofitable companies as a group produced stronger stock price returns
in 2020 compared to profitable companies, and the performance differential between unprofitable and
profitable business was particularly acute in the technology sector.
The financial services sector also detracted from relative performance. The payments and processing businesses
held in the Fund did not keep pace. In addition, the Fund’s credit sensitive financial holdings struggled,
suffering from the overhang of potential credit problems given economic weakness, and the headwind of low
rates and a flat yield curve. Even a small weight in this area hurt relative performance. Exposure to a company
providing a leading electronic bond trading platform, which performed well, helped moderate the sector’s
underperformance.

The healthcare sector positively contributed to Fund performance due to good stock picking. Notable
performance from holdings in the healthcare services, medical and dental instruments, and equipment
industries led to outperformance, highlighting the diversity of strength. Of note, two holdings providing
technologies used in the emerging treatment systems for diabetes also continued to perform well.
The Fund’s investments in two sectors, energy, and consumer staples, each had a single holding during the
year, owing to their small benchmark weights. Within energy, we sold a traditional oil and gas holding to
reduce exposure to falling oil prices. While the sale proved helpful, not participating in the sector’s alternative
energy industry, notably solar, hurt overall Fund performance. The consumer staples sector typically behaves in
a more defensive manner; however, the Fund’s holding of a specialty potato producer underperformed both in
the market decline and subsequent recovery as pandemic restrictions caused many restaurant closures, a key
end market for the company.
While the Fund’s cash position is not used tactically, in such a strong market advance even the modest amount
held by the Fund to accommodate additions to individual holdings or new investment ideas created a drag on
relative performance.
Signs of an increased appetite for risk among market participants appeared later in the year evidenced by
significant equity market strength and an uptick in mergers & acquisitions, not to mention sharp price
appreciation in other corners of the market like Bitcoin and IPOs. The Fed continues to signal a desire for an
accommodative monetary position to support the economy and lift inflation. We are encouraged by the
prospects for the economy to recover further in 2021 but are on guard for excesses that might emerge from the
significant push of money into the economic system.
The long-standing investment process underlying the Fund remains focused on identifying high-quality
companies that deliver attractive returns and above average growth relative to peers. Seeking to control risk at
the sector and position level is also a priority of our process, with the goal of providing lower volatility of
returns for the Fund compared to its benchmark index.

Characteristics”.
The Fund focuses on growth-style stocks and therefore the performance of the Fund will typically be more
volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that have a broader investment style.  The
Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities and ADRs. Foreign
investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations, political and economic instability, and
different and sometimes less strict financial reporting standards and regulation.  The Fund invests a substantial
portion of its assets in the stocks of mid-capitalization companies.  Mid-capitalization companies often are more
volatile and face greater risks than larger, more established companies.  U.S. and international markets have
experienced significant periods of volatility in recent years and months due to a number of economic, political
and global macro factors including the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and
related public health issues, growth concerns in the U.S. and overseas, uncertainties regarding interest rates,
trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries. These and other geopolitical
events may cause market disruptions and could have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
For information about the performance of the Fund as of the most recent month-end, please call

performance may be lower or higher than that stated.

Baird MidCap Fund
Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

Baird Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund
December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Portfolio Manager's Commentary
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Baird Small/Mid Growth Fund Institutional Class posted a total
return of 44.57% as compared to 40.47% for the Russell 2500®Growth Index, the Fund’s benchmark index.
The ability of equity markets to perform so well in 2020 amid a global pandemic and a near full stop of the
economy was rather remarkable, but scientific ingenuity applied to vaccine development and significant
central bank and government stimulus helped offset the devastating impacts of the virus. The Fund’s
positioning entering the year rested on an expectation for continued economic growth. Importantly, our
underlying philosophy of investing in a mix of diversified, high-quality growth businesses helped the Fund
navigate the significant market decline as the pandemic unfolded in March, as well as the sharp market
rebound that followed. The Fund produced a second consecutive year of returns in excess of 35%, exceeding
the benchmark return both years.
The Fund’s consumer discretionary holdings played a key role in driving relative outperformance. Despite the
pandemic’s significant toll on employment, substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus created enough of a
bridge to carry market expectations beyond the worst of the pandemic’s economic impact. The positive wealth
effect from a strong equity market and rising home prices and increased levels of consumer savings helped
support consumer confidence and spending. Typically, to achieve very strong relative performance in this
sector, it takes good stock picking in several areas, and this was the case in 2020 as the Fund holdings we
selected in diversified retail, e-commerce, home-related spending, and home building, industries performed
well. The Fund’s overweight positioning in the sector relative to the benchmark, based on the favorable
fundamentals described above, also contributed to performance.
The healthcare sector produced the second strongest relative returns for the Fund in calendar 2020.  This was
due to better than benchmark returns from businesses that either benefited from thecoronavirus (COVID-19)
crisis response, or were able to grow sales and earnings in spite of the crisis.  Examples include medical
technology companies with novel products, vaccine manufacturing or diagnostic testing companies, or
companies that provide life-saving products to treat cancer or diabetes. Furthermore, a few select Fund holdings
that were adversely affected due toCOVID-19, did better than benchmark returns as the market seemed to
assign increased valuations to them based on future years earnings from a more “normal” economic environment.
Based on new Russell benchmark industry definitions in 2020, the financial sector weight was reduced to less
than 5%.  The Fund’s relative returns were better than the benchmark due to two holdings in the portfolio, one
focused on insurance sold to small businesses and the other an electronic trading platform for fixed income
securities.  The Fund’s lone regional bank holding was a negative contributor to annual relative performance.
Similar to financials, the Fund holds only two telecommunications stocks, including a re-classified consumer
company the Fund has owned since inception.  This small industry was also a positive contributor to relative
performance for the year.
The Fund’s returns from investments in the producer durables and materials sectors exceeded benchmark
performance. It is worth grouping these two sectors together given that the prospects of many companies in
both tend to be heavily influenced by changes in the economic cycle. As a result, economic weakness in the
first half of the year challenged the stock performance of many companies in these sectors but returns broadly
improved in the second half. The standout performer for the Fund in the materials sector was a company that
produces composite decking primarily for residential homes. The overall housing market was strong in 2020
and Fund holdings in companies along the home spending chain, including repair and remodel, benefitted.
Other industrial companies that benefited the portfolio included auto suppliers, HVAC distributors, and a
leading manufacturer of back-up generators and storage technologies for solar energy. The Fund also held a
few services businesses and their generally more stable revenue streams held up well amid the market volatility
during the year.

December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
As a partial offset to the strength in preceding sectors, the Fund’s technology holdings trailed benchmark
performance. Returns were quite strong throughout the sector, particularly in the large software and services
group, leaving little room for stock-selection error. In some respects, the performance headwind was a matter
of style over substance. The technology sector includes an increasing number of high revenue growth, but
unprofitable companies. We view sustainable revenue growth and the ability to generate a profit as important
measures of quality. As a result, profitability is a fundamental characteristic that we generally require when
selecting investments for the Fund, although a small amount of Fund assets can be invested in unprofitable
businesses. Unprofitable companies as a group produced stronger stock price returns in 2020 compared to
profitable companies, and the performance differential between unprofitable and profitable business was
particularly acute in the technology sector.  So, although the Fund benefited from a few unprofitable holdings,
that was not enough to keep up with strong benchmark returns.
The Fund held only one stock in total between the energy and consumer staples sectors. The consumer staples
sector typically behaves in a more defensive manner; however, the Fund’s holding of a specialty potato
producer underperformed both in the market decline and subsequent recovery as pandemic restrictions caused
many restaurant closures, a key end market for the company.  The energy industry group in the Fund’s
benchmark is majority-weighted to clean or alternative energy businesses, and having no holdings in this
group was a detractor to the Fund’s relative performance for the year.
While the Fund’s cash position is not used tactically, in such a strong market advance even the modest amount
held by the Fund to accommodate additions to individual holdings or new investment ideas created a drag on
relative performance.
Signs of an increased appetite for risk among market participants appeared later in the year evidenced by
significant equity market strength and an uptick in mergers & acquisitions, not to mention sharp price
appreciation in other corners of the market like Bitcoin and IPOs. The Fed continues to signal a desire for an
accommodative monetary position to support the economy and lift inflation. We are encouraged by the
prospects for the economy to recover further in 2021 but are on guard for excesses that might emerge from the
significant push of money into the economic system.
The long-standing investment process underlying the Fund remains focused on identifying high-quality
companies that deliver attractive returns and above average growth relative to peers. Seeking to control risk at
the sector and position level is also a priority of our process, with the goal of providing lower volatility of
returns for the Fund compared to its benchmark index.

The Fund focuses on growth-style stocks and therefore the performance of the Fund will typically be more
volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that have a broader investment style.  The
Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities and ADRs. Foreign
investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations, political and economic instability, and
different and sometimes less strict financial reporting standards and regulation.  The Fund invests a
substantial portion of its assets in the stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies.  Small- and mid-
capitalization companies often are more volatile and face greater risks than larger, more established companies.
U.S. and international markets have experienced significant periods of volatility in recent years and months
due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors including the impact of the coronavirus
(COVID-19) as a global pandemic and related public health issues, growth concerns in the U.S. and overseas,
uncertainties regarding interest rates, trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other
countries. These and other geopolitical events may cause market disruptions and could have an adverse effect
on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

performance may be lower or higher than that stated.

Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Portfolio Manager’s Commentary
2020 equity returns were fueled primarily by investors’ expansion in price-to-earnings valuations as earnings
for many companies collapsed under the weight of the globalcoronavirus (COVID-19)pandemic.  As we look
to 2021, it is likely those elevated price-to-earnings valuations will unwind as company earnings recover.
Under such a scenario, we believe companies with strong profitability and earnings momentum will
outperform the broader market.
Historically, deep value/low quality stocks fall the hardest during market declines and lead equities out of bear
markets.  Their outsized returns tend to be strong and swift, but their returns also tend to be quickly exhausted
and yield to the returns of the broader market as the overall market recovery plays out.  Therefore, we believe
deep value stocks are unlikely to continue their recent winning ways as we have already been through a period
of expanding price-to-earnings ratios along with low quality and beta outperformance during the most recent
market downturn and subsequent recovery.
As we reflect upon performance for the calendar year 2020, we observe that the Fund performed consistent
with our investment discipline.  Our focus on high-quality businesses rewarded the Fund as expected during
the first quarter of 2020, providing strong downside protection as markets plummeted and powering the
Fund’s outperformance of its benchmark for the quarter.  We lived off this alpha outperformance for much of
the ricochet rebound during the next 8 months as deep value/low quality stocks led with the strongest returns
out of the bear market.  Similar to past market cycles, the recovery of high-quality stocks that provide strong
protection on the downside, seem to be proceeding at a more measured pace.  The next market phase, if we are
correct, will likely favor the protracted outperformance of high-quality value stocks through the remainder of
the economic cycle, which should benefit the Fund.
Portfolio Highlights
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Baird Small/Mid Value Fund Institutional Class posted a total
return of 0.48% as compared to 4.88% return for the Russell 2500®Value Index(“Russell 2500 Value”), the
Fund’s benchmark.
Significant contributors to the Fund’s relative and absolute performance for the year include the following:
• The single largest detractor to the Fund’s relative underperformance versus the Russell 2500 Value was its
position in Consumer Discretionary stocks.  The Fund’s underweight to industries such as restaurants and
retailers held back gains as many stocks in those areas performed ahead of our expectations despite a murky
outlook for profitability as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened throughout the year.  In addition, ZAGG
declined on lower demand for its mobile phone power management products, and the Fund sold the stock.
• Cerence, a provider of cognitive assistant solutions to the auto industry, skyrocketed 344% during the year
as the company solidified its dominant market position with multiple contract wins throughout the year.
• ARKO, a new position in the Fund, drifted lower after purchase and was a meaningful detractor for the year.
Despite closing two attractive acquisitions in the convenience store space, the stock ended the year down
14%, likely due to a lack of Wall Street coverage.  We took the opportunity to add to the Fund’s position.
• The Fund’s Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) exposure meaningfully outperformed the benchmark
sector performance due to superior security selection.  Standout gains were posted by CyrusOne, a data
center operator, and a hotel REIT,  RLJ Lodging Trust, which was purchased on the heels of positive
efficacy news for COVID-19 vaccines.
• The Fund’s Utility holdings gained more than 35% for the year, versus a decline for that sector in the
Fund’s benchmark, the Russell 2500 Value.  Our focus on renewable energy suppliers, Atlantica Yield
and Algonquin Power, led to strong absolute and relative returns.
• Despite gaining 22% for the year, the Fund’s Healthcare position trailed the corresponding benchmark
sector performance largely due to underperformance of Hill-Rom Holdings as hospital capital spending
suffered due to the pandemic.

December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
• The Fund’s intentional underweight to the Energy sector boosted performance as it was the worst
performing sector in the Russell 2500 Value, down 40%.
• Mixed performance among the Fund’s Industrial holdings held back absolute gains.  E-Commerce
logistics providers, Shyft Group and Air Transport Services were winners while FTI Consulting and
Astronics were detractors.
• The Fund’s overweight to Information Technology and superior security selection contributed positively
to performance.  The largest sector by weight in the Fund’s portfolio returned 34% during the year.
Notable winners include Immersion Technology and SkyWorks Solutions.

direct investment in the index is not possible.
The line graphs on the previous page and the returns shown in the table above reflect reinvestment of dividends
and/or capital gains distributions in additional shares. The returns in the graphs and table do not reflect the
deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. The

last business day of the period that were recorded on the first business day of the next period.
The gross expense ratio for each Class, as reflected in the Fund’s current prospectus, is set forth under “Portfolio
Characteristics”.
The Fund focuses on small to mid cap value style stocks and therefore the performance of the Fund may be
more volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that have a broader investment style.
The Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities and ADRs.
Foreign investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations and the potential for political
and economic instability, and different and sometimes less strict financial reporting standards and regulation.
The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies.
Small- and mid-capitalization companies often are more volatile and face greater risks than larger, more
established companies.  U.S. and international markets have experienced significant periods of volatility in
recent years and months due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors including the impact
of the coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and related public health issues, growth concerns in the
U.S. and overseas, uncertainties regarding interest rates, trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the
U.S. and other countries. These and other geopolitical events may cause market disruptions and could have an
adverse effect on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Baird SmallCap Value Fund Institutional Class posted a total
return of 2.85% as compared to 4.63% return for the Russell 2000®Value Index(“Russell 2000 Value”), the
Fund’s benchmark.
Significant contributors to the Fund’s relative and absolute performance for the year include the following:
• The single largest detractor to the Fund’s relative underperformance versus the Russell 2000 Value was its
position in Consumer Discretionary stocks.  The Fund’s underweight to industries such as restaurants and
retailers held back gains as many stocks in those areas performed ahead of our expectations despite a murky
outlook for profitability as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened throughout the year.  In addition, ZAGG
declined on lower demand for its mobile phone power management products, and the Fund sold the stock.
• The Fund’s Utility holdings gained more than 27% for the year, versus a decline for that sector in the
Fund’s benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value.  Our focus on renewable energy suppliers, Atlantica Yield
and Algonquin Power led to strong absolute and relative returns and made it the most significant
contributor to Fund performance for the year.
• Cerence, a provider of cognitive assistant solutions to the auto industry, skyrocketed 344% during the year
as the company solidified its dominant market position with multiple contract wins throughout the year.
• The Fund’s intentional underweight to the Energy sector boosted performance as it was the worst
performing sector in the Russell 2000 Value, down 38%.
• ARKO, a new position in the Fund, drifted lower after purchase and was a meaningful detractor for
the year.  Despite closing two attractive acquisitions in the convenience store space, the stock ended the
year down 14%, likely due to a lack of Wall Street coverage.  We took the opportunity to add to the
Fund’s position.

• The Fund’s Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) exposure meaningfully outperformed the benchmark
sector performance due to superior security selection.  Standout gains were posted by CyrusOne, a data
center operator, and hotel REITs (Ryman Hospitality and RLJ Lodging Trust), which were purchased on
the heels of positive efficacy news for COVID-19 vaccines.
• Despite gaining 22% for the year, the Fund’s Healthcare position trailed the corresponding benchmark
sector performance largely due to underperformance of Eagle Pharmaceutical and Hill-Rom as hospital
capital spending suffered due to the pandemic.
• Financials were another bright spot in the Fund both due to an underweight position and better security
selection.  Despite negative returns for the sector as a whole, many of the Fund’s long-time holdings such
as Axos Financial, Merchants Bank, and Old Republic posted strong gains.
• The Fund’s overweight to Information Technology and superior security selection contributed positively
to performance.  The largest sector by weight in the Fund’s portfolio returned 29% during the year.
Notable winners include Immersion Technology, Knowles Group and F5 Networks.

The Fund focuses on small cap value style stocks and therefore the performance of the Fund may be more
volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that have a broader investment style.  The
Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities and ADRs. Foreign
investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations and the potential for political and
economic instability, and different and sometimes less strict financial reporting standards and regulation. The
Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the stocks of small-capitalization companies.
Small-capitalization companies often are more volatile and face greater risks than larger, more established
companies.  U.S. and international markets have experienced significant periods of volatility in recent years
and months due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors including the impact of the
coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and related public health issues, growth concerns in the U.S.
and overseas, uncertainties regarding interest rates, trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the U.S.
and other countries. These and other geopolitical events may cause market disruptions and could have an
adverse effect on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Baird SmallCap Value Fund
Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

hierarchy. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the reporting period, as compared to the

Chautauqua International Growth Fund
December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Portfolio Manager’s Commentary
In 2020, the Chautauqua International Growth Fund Institutional Class returned 39.84%, significantly
outperformingits benchmark,the MSCI ACWI exU.S. Index®, which returned 10.65%.
The Fund typically holds a limited number of companies (25 to 35) invested primarily in equity securities of
non-U.S. companies with medium to large market capitalizations. Stock selection accounted for the majority
of the outperformance of the Chautauqua International Growth Fund, as compared tothe MSCI ACWI ex
U.S. Index®. Portfolio allocation was also a meaningful contributor to the outperformance, led by an
overweight in the information technology sector and an underweight in the energy sector, which we exited in
the first quarter. Investments in the information technology, health care, and consumer discretionary sectors
drove the majority of the outperformance, and standouts such as Adyen, SolarEdge, ASML, Genmab, WuXi
Biologics, TAL Education, and BYD were among the top contributors in the entire portfolio. On the other
hand, investments in the financials sector were a modest detractor from performance, especially investments in
Bank Rakyat, HDFC Bank, and DBS.
Heading into 2020, economic fundamentals were already weak and stock market performance had been overly
reliant on monetary accommodation. We were cautious. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we had realigned the
Fund towards portfolio companies we viewed as having more economically resilient business models and lower
valuation multiples. At the time, this was an extra measure of care to insulate the Fund should the fragile
global economy topple over.
Our cautious portfolio positioning at the start of the year proved to be prescient. The coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic spread around the world in the first quarter. Financial assets were battered, and stock
markets suffered a bear market decline. We were able to provide some downside protection in this
environment because of the portfolio changes we made in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Central banks and governments around the world responded to the crisis with large waves of fiscal and
monetary stimulus, amounting to many trillions of dollars worldwide. This served to prop up afflicted
consumers and businesses, stabilize financial markets, and guarantee liquidity almost anywhere it was needed.
We took advantage of market dislocations amidst the selloff to initiate positions in several companies that we
had analyzed and were monitoring on our watchlist. We initiated positions in Adyen, SolarEdge, Prosus,
Beigene, and WuXi Biologics. These investments proved to be among the most beneficial contributors to the
Fund’s performance in 2020.
Markets rallied vigorously in the second quarter. The dramatic rise in stock prices was accompanied by
extraordinary monetary accommodation, quantitative easing, and repeated signaling by central banks of a do-
anything willingness to bolster economies. Not only did this amount to a lower discount rate, which inflates
the value of financial assets, but it also provided a psychological backstop for investors. We were able to again
outperform in the second quarter as result of the significant repositioning amidst the selloff in the first quarter.
Markets grinded higher again in the third quarter, and our outperformance continued. However, we grew
concerned with the disconnect between stock prices and fundamentals. The economic recovery was stagnant
or uneven, meanwhile we believed valuation multiples climbed to excessive levels relative to earnings, which
had collapsed. We made changes in the Fund’s portfolio to reflect this caution, by taking profits from some
high valuation “winners”, redeploying to lower valuation holdings, and initiating new positions in Brookfield
Renewable and Fairfax Financial.
In the fourth quarter, positive developments of aCOVID-19vaccine improved market sentiment even further,
forming the basis for a sustainable reopening scenario and sending stocks even higher. More so, this helped
unleash a powerful “pro-cyclical” rotation, and value stocks substantially outperformed growth stocks. We were
able to again outperform in this market environment, aided by the prior changes in the portfolio. Because the
market continued to rally, we made additional changes to the portfolio to reflect our caution. We reduced
positions in Adyen, Bank Rakyat, DBS Group, and SolarEdge. Proceeds were used to increase positions in
Brookfield Renewable, BYD, Fairfax Financial, Novo Nordisk, Sinopharm, TAL Education, Tata Consultancy,
Temenos, and WuXi Biologics.

Outlook
Due to the vaccine developments, the most likely economic scenario is one that improves in the next year. And
we believe, we have averted a disaster scenario in which the pandemic continues to grow unchecked. As the
vaccine is administered to larger swaths of the population, herd immunity is expected to increase, and the
spread of the disease should decline. Vaccine manufacturers have announced expected availability in the
billions of doses. The most uncertain aspects pertain to how much reach in the next year medical professionals
will actually have administering the vaccines, and when emerging countries can obtain their share.
Central banks have become much more optimistic about the prospects for a rebound, albeit shallower and
choppier than originally anticipated, in the next year. Many macroeconomic indicators have stabilized and are
no longer deteriorating, with the exception of services and consumption data that are more sensitive to
weakness in domestic economies. However, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases is expected to have
follow-through effects on near-term economic growth. And while downside risks have been reduced in recent
months, the most likely risks to economic recovery pertain to renewed containment measures. The availability
of the vaccine is positive for the economic outlook and is further assisted by ongoing supportive measures by
central banks and governments.
Monetary policy will continue to be an important component of the market narrative, but a depleted arsenal
and general fatigue also play into worries that monetary policy is increasingly pushing on a string. Therefore,
fiscal policy will play an even more critical role for supporting economies in these difficult times. Fortunately,
recent important fiscal stimulus packages were passed and made it through political gridlock.
The rotation from growth outperformance to value outperformance was not terribly surprising. The
interesting question is whether the rotation might be sustainable, especially as recent instances of growth to
value rotations have tended to fizzle. The case that value stocks have more room to grow in price revolves
around expectations for more positive vaccine developments and a rebound in corporate earnings.
Furthermore, cyclical sectors should be a beneficiary of the economic reopening. Valuation differences between
growth stocks and value stocks are still near their widest point over the last ten years. And overall, we believe
market valuations have become expensive relative to current earnings power, and they are likely to stay elevated
next year as central banks continue to ease into the recovery.
While valuations are high across the market, on a relative basis, they are still most attractive for international
stocks. The pandemic has delivered a global growth shock, but in doing so, it has accelerated the timeline for
several mega trends that the Fund has been actively investing in, such as productivity enhancement (robotics,
automation, and software), e-commerce, electronic payments, and rapid drug development. Furthermore,
many portfolio companies have been able to continue to deliver growth even in this recessionary environment,
which is an exceptionally rare trait.
We have made adjustments to the Fund portfolio, including realizing profits from some high valuation
“winners”, redeploying to lower valuation holdings, and raising cash levels so we hold some dry powder. On
the margin, these changes should help mitigate some downside if markets become less hospitable, and we
continue to contemplate further adjustments for a more conservative balance of growth, profitability, and
valuation in the portfolio.

U.S.-based companies. The MSCI ACWI ex USA Index includes both developed and emerging markets.
This index does not reflect any deduction for fees, expenses or taxes. A direct investment in the index is
not possible.
The line graphs on the previous page and the returns shown in the table above reflect reinvestment of dividends
and/or capital gains distributions in additional shares. The returns in the graphs and table do not reflect the
deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. The
returns reflect the actual performance for each period and do not include the impact of trades executed on the
last business day of the period that were recorded on the first business day of the next period.
The gross expense ratio for each Class, as reflected in the Fund’s current prospectus, is set forth under “Portfolio
Characteristics”.
The Fund focuses primarily onnon-U.S. stocks with medium to large market capitalizations and therefore the
performance of the Fund may be more volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that
have a broader investment style.  Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its total
assets in non-U.S. companies. Foreign investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations and
the potential for political and economic instability, and different and sometimes less strict financial reporting
standards and regulation.  U.S. and international markets have experienced significant periods of volatility in
recent years and months due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors including the impact of
the coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and related public health issues, growth concerns in the U.S.
and overseas, uncertainties regarding interest rates, trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the U.S.
and other countries. In addition,the United Kingdomwithdrewfrom the European Union on January 31, 2020
following a June 2016 referendum referred to as “Brexit.” Although the EU and UK agreed to a trade deal in
December 2020, there is significant market uncertainty regarding Brexit’s ramifications, and the range of possible
political, regulatory, economic, and market outcomes are difficult to predict. These and other geopolitical events
may cause market disruptions and could have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

Chautauqua Global Growth Fund
December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Portfolio Manager’s Commentary
In 2020, the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund Institutional Class returned 37.97%, significantly
outperforming its benchmark, the MSCI ACWI Index®, which returned 16.25%.
The Fund typically holds a limited number of companies (35 to 45) invested primarily in equity securities of both
U.S. and non-U.S. companies with medium to large market capitalizations. Stock selection accounted for the
majority of the outperformance of the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund, as compared tothe MSCI ACWI
Index®. Portfolio allocation was also a meaningful contributor to the outperformance, led by an overweight in the
information technology sector and an underweight in the energy sector, which we exited in the first quarter.
Investments in the information technology, health care, and consumer discretionary sectors drove the majority of
the outperformance, and standouts such as Adyen, SolarEdge, Genmab, WuXi Biologics, TAL Education, and
BYD were among the top contributors in the entire portfolio. While all regions positively contributed to the Fund
overall, relative underweight exposure to the United States detracted from the allocation effect in North America.
Heading into 2020, economic fundamentals were already weak and stock market performance had been overly
reliant on monetary accommodation. We were cautious. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we had realigned the
Fund towards portfolio companies we viewed as having more economically resilient business models and lower
valuation multiples. At the time, this was an extra measure of care to insulate the Fund should the fragile
global economy topple over.
Our cautious portfolio positioning at the start of the year proved to be prescient. The coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic spread around the world in the first quarter. Financial assets were battered, and stock
markets suffered a bear market decline. We were able to provide some downside protection in this
environment because of the portfolio changes we made in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Central banks and governments around the world responded to the crisis with large waves of fiscal and
monetary stimulus, amounting to many trillions of dollars worldwide. This served to prop up afflicted
consumers and businesses, stabilize financial markets, and guarantee liquidity almost anywhere it was needed.
We took advantage of market dislocations amidst the selloff to initiate positions in several companies that we
had analyzed and were monitoring on our watchlist. We initiated positions in Adyen, EPAM Systems,
SolarEdge, Prosus, Beigene, and WuXi Biologics. These investments proved to be among the most beneficial
contributors to the Fund’s performance in 2020.
Markets rallied vigorously in the second quarter. The dramatic rise in stock prices was accompanied by
extraordinary monetary accommodation, quantitative easing, and repeated signaling by central banks of a do-
anything willingness to bolster economies. Not only did this amount to a lower discount rate, which inflates
the value of financial assets, but it also provided a psychological backstop for investors. We were able to again
outperform in the second quarter as result of the significant repositioning amidst the selloff in the first quarter.
Markets grinded higher again in the third quarter, and our outperformance continued. However, we grew
concerned with the disconnect between stock prices and fundamentals. The economic recovery was stagnant
or uneven, meanwhile we believed valuation multiples climbed to excessive levels relative to earnings, which
had collapsed. We made changes in the Fund’s portfolio to reflect this caution, by taking profits from some
high valuation “winners”, redeploying to lower valuation holdings, and initiating new positions in Alteryx,
Brookfield Renewable, and Fairfax Financial.
In the fourth quarter, positive developments of aCOVID-19vaccine improved market sentiment even further,
forming the basis for a sustainable reopening scenario and sending stocks even higher. More so, this helped
unleash a powerful “pro-cyclical” rotation, and value stocks substantially outperformed growth stocks. We were
able to again outperform in this market environment, aided by the prior changes in the portfolio. Because the
market continued to rally, we made additional changes to the portfolio to reflect our caution. We reduced
positions in Adyen, Atlassian, BYD, and SolarEdge. Proceeds were used to initiate a new position in
Alexandria Real Estate and increase positions in Bank Rakyat, Brookfield Renewable, DBS, Sinopharm, Tata
Consultancy, and WuXi Biologics.

Outlook
Due to the vaccine developments, the most likely economic scenario is one that improves in the next year. And
we believe, we have averted a disaster scenario in which the pandemic continues to grow unchecked. As the
vaccine is administered to larger swaths of the population, herd immunity is expected to increase, and the
spread of the disease should decline. Vaccine manufacturers have announced expected availability in the
billions of doses. The most uncertain aspects pertain to how much reach in the next year medical professionals
will actually have administering the vaccines, and when emerging countries can obtain their share.
Central banks have become much more optimistic about the prospects for a rebound, albeit shallower and
choppier than originally anticipated, in the next year. Many macroeconomic indicators have stabilized and are
no longer deteriorating, with the exception of services and consumption data that are more sensitive to
weakness in domestic economies. However, the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases is expected to have
follow-through effects on near-term economic growth. And while downside risks have been reduced in recent
months, the most likely risks to economic recovery pertain to renewed containment measures. The availability
of the vaccine is positive for the economic outlook and is further assisted by ongoing supportive measures by
central banks and governments.
Monetary policy will continue to be an important component of the market narrative, but a depleted arsenal
and general fatigue also play into worries that monetary policy is increasingly pushing on a string. Therefore,
fiscal policy will play an even more critical role for supporting economies in these difficult times. Fortunately,
recent important fiscal stimulus packages were passed and made it through political gridlock.
The rotation from growth outperformance to value outperformance was not terribly surprising. The
interesting question is whether the rotation might be sustainable, especially as recent instances of growth to
value rotations have tended to fizzle. The case that value stocks have more room to grow in price revolves
around expectations for more positive vaccine developments and a rebound in corporate earnings.
Furthermore, cyclical sectors should be a beneficiary of the economic reopening. Valuation differences between
growth stocks and value stocks are still near their widest point over the last ten years. And overall, we believe
market valuations have become expensive relative to current earnings power, and they are likely to stay elevated
next year as central banks continue to ease into the recovery.
While valuations are high across the market, on a relative basis, they are still most attractive for international
stocks. The pandemic has delivered a global growth shock, but in doing so, it has accelerated the timeline for
several mega trends that the Fund has been actively investing in, such as productivity enhancement (robotics,
automation, and software), e-commerce, electronic payments, and rapid drug development. Furthermore,
many portfolio companies have been able to continue to deliver growth even in this recessionary environment,
which is an exceptionally rare trait.
We have made adjustments to the Fund portfolio, including realizing profits from some high valuation
“winners”, redeploying to lower valuation holdings, and raising cash levels so we hold some dry powder. On
the margin, these changes should help mitigate some downside if markets become less hospitable, and we
continue to contemplate further adjustments for a more conservative balance of growth, profitability, and
valuation in the portfolio.

(2)The MSCI ACWI Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index maintained by MSCI, Inc. and
designed to provide a broad measure of stock performance throughout the world. The MSCI ACWI Index
includes both developed and emerging markets.  This index does not reflect any deduction for fees,
expenses or taxes. A direct investment in the index is not possible.
The line graphs on the previous page and the returns shown in the table above reflect reinvestment of dividends
and/or capital gains distributions in additional shares. The returns in the graphs and table do not reflect the
deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. The
returns reflect the actual performance for each period and do not include the impact of trades executed on the
last business day of the period that were recorded on the first business day of the next period.
The gross expense ratio for each Class, as reflected in the Fund’s current prospectus, is set forth under “Portfolio
Characteristics”.
The Fund focuses on both U.S. and non-U.S. stocks with medium to large market capitalizations and therefore the
performance of the Fund may be more volatile than the performance of funds that focus on types of stocks that
have a broader investment style.  Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 40% of its total
assets in non-U.S. companies. Foreign investments involve additional risks such as currency rate fluctuations and
the potential for political and economic instability, and different and sometimes less strict financial reporting
standards and regulation.  U.S. and international markets have experienced significant periods of volatility in
recent years and months due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors including the impact of
the coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic and related public health issues, growth concerns in the U.S.
and overseas, uncertainties regarding interest rates, trade tensions and the threat of tariffs imposed by the U.S.
and other countries. In addition,the United Kingdomwithdrewfrom the European Union on January 31, 2020
following a June 2016 referendum referred to as “Brexit.”  Although the EU and UK agreed to a trade deal in
December 2020, there is significant market uncertainty regarding Brexit’s ramifications, and the range of possible
political, regulatory, economic, and market outcomes are difficult to predict. These and other geopolitical events
may cause market disruptions and could have an adverse effect on the value of the Fund’s investments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so
that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
For information about the performance of the Fund as of the most recent month-end, please call

performance may be lower or higher than that stated.

Chautauqua Global Growth Fund
Summary of Fair Value Exposure at December 31, 2020
The Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish a definition of fair
value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the
various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion on
changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These standards define fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions (referred to as “inputs”) used
in pricing the asset or liability. These standards state that “observable inputs” reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent
sources and “unobservable inputs” reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are summarized into three broad levels and
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity
can access at the measurement date.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of December 31, 2020:

* Additional information regarding the industry classifications of these investments is disclosed in the
Schedule of Investments.
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers into or out of assigned levels within the fair value
hierarchy. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the reporting period, as compared to the
security classifications from the prior year’s annual report. See the Fund’s Valuation Policy in Note 2a to the
financial statements.

Additional Information on Fund Expenses
December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)
Example
As a shareholder of a mutual fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, which may include sales
charges (loads) on purchase payments, reinvested dividends, or other distributions; redemption fees; and
exchange fees; and (2) ongoing costs, such as management fees; distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees; and
other fund expenses. With the exception of the Chautauqua International Growth and Chautauqua Global
Growth Funds, which charge redemption fees, the Funds do not charge any sales loads, redemption fees or
other transaction fees; however, you will be assessed fees for outgoing wire transfers, returned checks and stop
payment orders at prevailing rates charged by U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, doing business as U.S. Bank
Global Fund Services, the Funds’ transfer agent. If you request that a redemption be made by wire transfer,
currently the Funds’ transfer agent charges a $15.00 fee.
This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in each Fund and
to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example is based on an
investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (7/1/20 –12/31/20).
Actual Expenses
The third and fourth columns of the following table provide information about account values based on actual
returns and actual expenses. You may use the information in these columns, together with the amount you
invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the
fourth column entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account
during this period.
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes
The fifth and sixth columns of the following table provide information about hypothetical account values and
hypothetical expenses based on the Funds’ actual expense ratios and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year
before expenses, which is not the Funds’ actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this
information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Funds and other mutual funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder
reports of the other mutual funds. Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs. Therefore, the sixth column of the table (entitled
“Expenses Paid During Period”) is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine
the relative total costs of owning different mutual funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,
your costs could have been higher.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)
a) Investment Valuation– Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, together with the rules and interpretations of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)require the Funds, in computing net asset
value, to value their portfolio securities using market quotations when they are “readily available.” When
market quotations are not readily available (e.g., because there is no regular market quotation for such
securities, the market for such security is limited, the validity of quotations is questionable or, for debt
securities, the Funds’ independent pricing service does not provide a price), the Board of Directors (the
“Board”) of the Corporationis responsible for ensuring the securities are valuedat “fair value determined
in good faith.” The Board has delegated such responsibility to the Advisor pursuant to pricing policies and
procedures that the Board has adopted and regularly reviews. In general, the “fair value” of a security
means the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.
The Funds determine the fair value of their investments and compute their net asset value per share as of
the close of regular trading of the New York Stock Exchange (4:00 p.m. ET).
Consistent with Section 2(a)(41) of the 1940 Act, the Funds price their securities as follows: common
stocks that are listed on a securities exchange (other than NASDAQ) are valued at the last quoted sale
price. Securities traded on NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price.  Price
information on listed stocks is taken from the exchange where the security is primarily traded.  Securities
that were not traded on the valuation date, as well as stocks that are not listed on an exchange, including
NASDAQ, are valued at the average of the current bid and ask price.  Debt securities are valued at their
evaluated bid prices as provided by an independent pricing service using valuation methods that are
designed to represent fair value, such as matrix pricing and other analytical pricing models, market
transactions and dealer quotations.  Debt securities purchased with maturities of 60 days or less are
valued as described above unless an evaluated price is not available, in which case such security is valued
at acquisition cost, plus or minus any amortized discount or premium (“amortized cost”), or, if the
Advisor does not believe amortized cost is reflective of the fair value of the security, the security is priced
at fair value as described below.  Investments in mutual funds, including money market funds, are valued
at their stated net asset value (“NAV”). Other assets and securities for which market quotations are not
readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Advisor in accordance with
procedures approved by the Corporation’s Board.  In accordance with such procedures, the Advisor may,
under certain circumstances, use alternative valuation methodologies, or it may use broker quotes or
prices obtained from alternative independent pricing services or, if broker quotes or prices from
alternative pricing services are unavailable or deemed to be unreliable, fair value will be determined by a
valuation committee of the Advisor.  In determining fair value, the valuation committee takes into
account factors deemed relevant by the valuation committee and available information. Consequently,
the price of the security used by a Fund to calculate its NAV may differ from quoted or published prices
for the same security.  Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and there is no single standard for
determining a security’s fair value.  As a result, different mutual funds could reasonably arrive at a
different fair value for the same security. It is possible that the fair value determined for a security is
materially different from the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security or from the values
that other mutual funds may determine. The prices determined for any individual security on any given
day may vary significantly from the amount that can be obtained in an actual sale of that security, and
the Funds’ NAV may fluctuate significantly from day to day or from period to period.
The Chautauqua International Growth and Chautauqua Global Growth Funds have retained an
independent fair value pricing service to assist in valuing foreign securities in order to adjust for possible
changes in value that may occur between the close of the foreign exchange and the time at which the Funds
calculate their NAVs. The fair value pricing service uses statistical data based on historical performance of
securities and markets, and other data in developing factors used to estimate fair value for that day.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)
b) Foreign Securities– For purposes of these financial statements, foreign securities are defined as securities
issued by companies that are organized outside the United States.  Investing in securities of foreign
companies and foreign governments involves special risks and considerations not typically associated
with investing in U.S. companies and the U.S. government.  These risks include foreign currency
fluctuations and adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, securities of many foreign
companies and foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile
than those of securities of comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.  Occasionally, events
that affect these values and exchange rates may occur after the close of the exchange on which such
securities are traded.  If such events materially affect the value of a Fund’s securities, these securities may
be valued at their fair value pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board.
c) Foreign Currency Translation – Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar amounts at date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
portfolio securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar
amounts on the respective dates of such transactions. When a Fund purchases or sells a foreign security,
it will customarily enter into a foreign exchange contract to minimize foreign exchange risk from the
trade date to the settlement date of such transaction. The Funds do not isolate the portion of the results
of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations
arising from changes in market prices of securities held nor currency gains or losses realized between the
trade and settlement dates on securities transactions. Such fluctuations are included with the net realized
and unrealized gain or loss from investments. Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currency translations
include those gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign currencies, currency gains or losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on foreign currency transactions, the differences between the
amounts of dividends, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on a Fund’s books, and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
investments includes changes in the value of investments resulting from exchange rates.
d) Income Tax Status – The Funds intend to continue to qualify as regulated investment companies as
provided in Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of their
taxable income to their shareholders in a manner which results in no tax expense to the Funds.
Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is recorded.
There is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax
positions taken or expected to be taken on the tax return for the year ended December 31, 2020, or for
any other tax years which are open for exam.  As of December 31, 2020, open tax years include the tax
years ended December 31, 2017 through 2020.  The Funds are not aware of any tax positions for which
it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in
the next 12 months.  The Funds recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
benefits as interest expense and other expense, respectively, in the Statement of Operations.  During the
period, the Funds did not incur any interest or penalties.
e) Shareholder Transactions and Distributions – Shareholder transactions are recorded on trade date.
Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid annually.  Distributions of net
realized capital gains, if any, are declared and paid at least annually.  All distributions to shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date.  The book basis character of distributions may differ from their ultimate
characterization for Federal income tax purposes.  GAAP requires that permanent financial reporting and
tax differences be reclassified in the capital accounts.
f) Allocation of Income and Expenses– Each Fund is charged for those expenses directly attributable to it.
Expenses directly attributable to a class of shares, such as Rule 12b-1 distribution fees, are charged to that
class of shares.  Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated to the classes
based on their respective net assets.  Expenses that are not directly attributable to a Fund are allocated among
the Funds in the series in proportion to their respective assets or are divided equally amongst the Funds.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)
g) Use of Estimates– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts ofincome
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
h) Securities Transactions and Investment Income– Investment transactions are recorded on trade date.
The Funds determine the gain or loss realized from investment transactions using the identified cost basis.
For financial reporting purposes, investment transactions are recorded on the trade date.  When a capital
gain tax is determined to apply, the Fund may record an estimated deferred tax liability in an amount that
would be payable if the securities were disposed of on the valuation date.  Dividend income is recognized
on the ex-dividend date net of withholding taxes, if any, and interest income is recognized on an accrual
basis.  Withholding taxes on foreign dividends have been accounted for in accordance with the Funds’
interpretation of applicable tax laws of the countries in which they invest. Distributions received from
underlying investments in real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) may be classified as dividends, capital
gains or return of capital.
i) Guarantees and Indemnifications– In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts
with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Funds’ maximum exposure
under these arrangements is unknown and would involve future claims against the Funds that have not
yet occurred.  Based on experience, the Funds would expect the risk of loss to be remote.
j) Other Matters –The global outbreak of COVID-19 (commonly referred to as “coronavirus”) has
disrupted economic markets and the prolonged economic impact is uncertain. The ultimate economic
fallout from the pandemic, and the long-term impact on economies, markets, industries and individual
issuers, are not known. The operational and financial performance of the issuers of securities in which
the Funds invest depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak,
and such uncertainty may in turn adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Funds’ investments,
impair the Funds’ ability to satisfy redemption requests, and negatively impact the Funds’ performance.

The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation is attributable primarily to the tax
deferral of losses on wash salesand mark-to-market on passive foreign investment companies.
Additionally, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that certain components of net assets relating
to permanent differences be reclassified between financial and tax reporting.  These reclassifications are
primarily due to differing treatments for equalization accounting for tax purposes.  These reclassifications have
no effect on net assets or net asset value per share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the following table
shows the reclassifications made:

Distributions to Shareholders
Each Fund generally pays dividends from net investment income and distributes net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. Certain Funds also utilize earnings and profits distributed to
shareholders on redemptions of shares as part of the dividends paid deduction.

The Funds’ financial highlights for the period ended December 31, 2016, were audited by other auditors
whose report dated February 27, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds’ management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Funds’ financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be
independent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2020, by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
We have served as the Funds’ auditor since 2017.

Baird Funds, Inc.
Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors’ Approval of the Investment
Advisory Agreement for Baird Equity Funds (Unaudited)
The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Baird Funds, Inc. (the “Corporation”),comprised ofdirectors who
are not “interested persons” of the Corporation within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the “Independent Directors”) met on August 17 and August 25, 2020 to consider the annual renewal of the
investment advisory agreement between Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated (“Baird” or the “Advisor”) and
the Corporation on behalf of the Baird MidCap Fund, Baird Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund, Baird Small/Mid
Cap Value Fund, Baird SmallCap Value Fund, Chautauqua International Growth Fund and Chautauqua
Global Growth Fund (the “Equity Funds” or the “Funds”).
The Board, all of whom are Independent Directors, approved the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement for the Equity Funds through a process that concluded at the August 25, 2020 meeting.  In
connection with its consideration of the investment advisory agreement, the Board reviewed and discussed
various information that had been provided prior to the meeting, including a copy of the investment advisory
agreement and related fee schedules, a memorandum provided by legal counsel summarizing the guidelines
relevant to the Board’s consideration of the investment advisory agreement, a memorandum and other
information provided in response to a request from the Board by the Advisor, including information about the
operation of the Advisor and the Funds during the COVID-19 pandemic, a copy of the Advisor’s Form ADV
Part 1A and Form ADV Part 2 brochures and brochure supplements, the annual report and audited
consolidated financial statements for Baird Financial Group, Inc. (the Advisor’s parent company), a
profitability analysis, comparative information about the Funds’ performance for the applicable periods ended
June 30, 2020, comparative information about management fees and expense ratios, composite performance
information for similar accounts managed by the Advisor, trading and brokerage commission information and
other pertinent information.
The Board considered the Advisor’s 15(c) response and discussed various questions and information with
representatives of the Advisor at the August 17, 2020 special meeting.  At the August 25, 2020 meeting, the
Board met in executive session with the Funds’ legal counsel to consider the investment advisory agreement.
The Board also took into account information reviewed periodically throughout the year that was relevant to
its consideration of the investment advisory agreement, including performance, management fee and other
expense information, compliance matters, business initiatives of the Advisor, information about investments
made by the Advisor in personnel, technology and services that benefit the Funds and discussions with the
Funds’ portfolio managers.
Based on its evaluation of this information, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved
the continuation of the investment advisory agreement for theFunds for an additional one-year period.
In considering the investment advisory agreement and reaching its conclusions, the Board reviewed and
analyzed various factors that it determined were relevant, including the factors below.  In deciding to approve
the investment advisory agreement for each Fund, the Board did not identify any single factor as determinative
but considered all factors together.

The Board considered the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Advisor to the Funds.  The
Board noted the Advisor’s overall reputation and depth of the Advisor’s personnel, resources and commitment
to the Funds and the experience of the portfolio management teams employed to manage the Funds’
investments.  The Board considered the credentials and continuity of the portfolio management teams for the
Funds and noted that the Advisor continues to add resources in support of the Funds, including investments
in personnel, technology, systems, trading and research capabilities, databases, work from home infrastructure
and virtual meeting technology.  The Board considered the information provided by the Advisor regarding the
effective implementation of the Advisor’s business continuity plan and the performance and operation of the
Funds during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors’ Approval of the Investment
Advisory Agreement for Baird Equity Funds (Unaudited) (Continued)
The Board considered the Advisor’s disciplined investment decision making process used for the Funds.  The
Board also considered other services that the Advisor provides the Funds in its capacity as their investment
advisor, such as making some of its key personnel available to serve as officers of the Funds, selecting broker-
dealers for execution of portfolio transactions, ensuring adherence to the Funds’ investment policies and
restrictions, proxy voting, compliance, risk management services, administering the Funds’ liquidity risk
management program, administering the Funds’ cybersecurity program and business continuity plan,
valuation support, providing support services to the Board and the committees of the Board and overseeing
the Funds’ other service providers.  The Board noted the general stability of the assets managed by Baird
Equity Asset Management despite outflows in certain Funds.  The Board also considered the strength of the
Advisor’s compliance department, including the credentials of the Funds’ chief compliance officer, as well as
the Advisor’s risk management system.  The Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the Advisor to the Funds were appropriate and that each Fund was likely to continue to benefit
from services provided under the investment advisory agreement.

In considering the investment performance of each of the Funds, the Board reviewed information as of June
30, 2020 regarding the performance of each class of the Fund for applicable one-year, three-year, five-year, ten-
year and since-inception periods in comparison to its benchmark index and its peer group as determined by
Lipper.  The Board also considered the Funds’ performance during the recent market downturn in the first six
months of 2020 and noted that almost all of the Funds’ Institutional Class had seen positive relative
performance against their benchmarks during this period.  The Board also reviewed composite investment
performance of Baird Equity Asset Management with respect to accounts managed by the Advisor that are
comparable to the Funds but did not consider it to be a material factor in the 15(c) process.
The Board noted that the performance of the Institutional Class of the MidCap Fund exceeded the benchmark
index, but underperformed the Lipper peer group average for the one-year period, exceeded the benchmark
index and Lipper peer group average for the three- and five-year periods, underperformed the benchmark index,
but exceeded the Lipper peer group average for the ten-year period and exceeded the benchmark index and
Lipper peer group average for the since-inception period.  The Board took note of the outperformance of the
Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund since inception on October 31, 2018 as compared to both the benchmark index
and Lipper peer group.  The Board noted that the SmallCap Value Fund and Small/Mid Cap Value Fund have
outperformed the benchmark index over the one- and three-year periods, the Small Cap Value Fund has
underperformed the benchmark index for the five-year period and both Funds underperformed the benchmark
index for the since inception period.  During the relevant periods, the Funds underperformed the Lipper peer
group index.  The Board noted that the Advisor considers the Funds to be appropriately classified as value funds
whereas Lipper classifies the Funds as core funds and that underperformance versus the small-cap core peer
group has been influenced by the growth tilt of many core managers as growth has continued to outperform
value.  The Board took note of the Advisor’s commentary regarding the Funds’ underperformance in certain
time periods and the Advisor’s commitment to closely monitor the Value Funds’ performance going forward.
The Board noted that the Institutional Class of the Chautauqua International Growth Fund had
outperformed the benchmark index and Lipper peer group for the one-, three- and since-inception periods
and the Institutional Class of the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund had outperformed the benchmark index
and Lipper peer group for the one-year and since-inception periods and had outperformed the benchmark, but
underperformed the Lipper peer group, for the three-year period.
The Board also considered the Advisor’s quarterly portfolio commentaries and reviews explaining the Funds’
performance and the investment strategies the Advisor employs for each Fund.  The Board concluded that,
although past performance is not a guarantee of future results, each Fund and its shareholders were likely to
benefit from the continued management by the Advisor.

The Board reviewed the fee and expense information for each of the Funds, including a comparison of each
Fund’s advisory fee and total net expense ratio to industry data for other mutual funds in the same
Morningstar peer group.  The Board noted that the advisory fee for the MidCap Fund and the Small/MidCap
Growth Fund is slightly above the Morningstar category average; the advisory fee for the Small/Mid Cap Value
Fund is below the Morningstar category average; and the advisory fee for the Small/Cap Value Fund, the
Chautauqua International Growth Fund and the Chautauqua Global Growth Fund is above the category
average.  The Board also considered the total expense ratio of each Fund, after fee waivers and expense
reimbursements by the Advisor, relative to all other mutual funds in its Morningstar category.  The Board
noted that the net expense ratios for each class of the Funds, after waivers, are below the Morningstar average
except for the Investor Class of the SmallCap Value Fund, which has an expense ratio that is slightly above the
peer group average.  The Board considered the Advisor’s commentary regarding the competitiveness of the
Equity Funds’ fees, as well as fee comparisons for the Institutional Class of each Fund with the institutional
shares of similarly sized funds, noting that the expense ratio of the Institutional Class of each Fund fell below
the category average.
The Board also reviewed and considered management fees charged by the Advisor to other investment
advisory clients, including separately managed accounts, subadvisory arrangements with unaffiliated mutual
funds, two private limited partnerships managed in strategies similar to the International Growth Fund and
the Global Growth Fund  and a collective investment trust, but did not consider these comparisons to be a
material factor given the difference in services provided by the Advisor and the additional risks assumed by the
Advisor as investment adviser to the Funds.
The Board noted the extent of the significant additional services provided to the Funds that the Advisor did
not provide in other advisory and subadvisory relationships.  Those services included operational support,
valuation services, administration of the Funds’ liquidity risk management program, oversight of the Funds’
other service providers, director support, preparation of regulatory filings, implementation of the Funds’
compliance program including employment of the Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance
staff, the operation of the Funds’ business continuity plan and cybersecurity plan, and various other services.
In addition, the Board noted that the provision of investment advisory services to the Funds requires more
effort than it does for other accounts due to daily sales and redemption activity and additional regulatory and
compliance requirements.
The Board concluded that the management fee and total expense ratio of each Fund were reasonable in light
of the nature and quality of services provided and fees paid by comparable funds.
_C_o_s_ts_ a_n_d_ _P_r_o_fi_ta_b_i_li_t_y
The Board considered the fees realized, and the costs incurred, by the Advisor in providing investment
management services to the Funds and a profitability analysis with respect to each Fund.  The Board
considered that the Advisor’s profitability information does not reflect costs incurred for various support
services to the Funds such as IT, compliance, risk, legal and finance.  The Board reviewed the financial
condition of the Advisor and its parent company and determined it to be sound.  The Board concluded that
the Advisor’s current level of profitability was reasonable.

The Board reviewed asset levels for each Fund and considered whether there may be economies of scale in the
management of each Fund at current levels and if its assets were to increase significantly.

Baird Funds, Inc.
Disclosure Regarding the Board of Directors’ Approval of the Investment
Advisory Agreement for Baird Equity Funds (Unaudited) (Continued)
The Board recognized that the Advisor has waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses for each Fund pursuant to
the fee waiver/expense reimbursement agreement.  Other than the MidCap Fund, the Board did not consider
economies of scale to be a material factor due to the current asset size of each Fund.  The Board noted that the
MidCap Fund’s management fee structure does not contain any breakpoint reductions as the Fund’s assets
grow in size but considered the expenses incurred and management fees waived by the Advisor in the past.
The Directors concluded that the current fee structure of each Fund was reasonable.

The Board considered other benefits to the Advisor from serving as advisor to the Funds (in addition to the
advisory fee).  Those benefits include Rule 12b-1 fees received by the Distributor and its representatives.  The
Board noted that the Advisor derives ancillary benefits from its association with the Equity Funds in the form
of research products and services received from unaffiliated broker-dealers who execute portfolio trades for the
Funds. The Board noted that the Advisor’s asset management and other businesses may experience indirect
benefits from the Advisor’s association with the Funds.  The Board concluded that the other benefits realized
by the Advisor from its relationship with the Funds were appropriate.
Based on its evaluation of the above factors, the Directors, all of whom are Independent Directors, concluded that
the continuation of the investment advisory agreement was in the best interest of each Fund and its shareholders.
