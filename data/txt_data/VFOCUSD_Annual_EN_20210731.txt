Overview of the Thai Stock Market August 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021 
 
August 2020 to July 2021: No abatement of the spread of COVID-19 outside the country, as seen in rapid 
increases in number of daily new cases, pressured the market mood after mid- June 2020 to October 2020. 
Intensifying political rallies, especially after attempts of dissolution in October 2020 worse earnings in 2Q20 (falling 
both YoY and QoQ) announced in July 2020 - August 2020 investors to downsize portfolios. However, the market 
pattern changed in November 2020, switching from downward to upward on a flow of good news. The US 
presidential election was won by Joe Biden, leading capital to flow into emerging markets as investors expected 
Biden’s foreign policy to be more compromising and cooperative than Trump’s, which freshened international 
trade and investment. Progress in COVID-19 vaccine trials also supported as tests of two drug makers showed 
their vaccines were more than 90% effective. The momentum continued in December 2020 as inmvestors felt more 
hopeful on rapid economic recovery after the Food and Drug Administrations in many countries approved 
emergency use of the coronavirus vaccine and began vaccinations. A rise of over 100% in DELTA gave a big 
push to the market in December 2020. The SET contracted in January 2021 on panic over a second wave of 
COVID-19 in the country. Increase in daily new cases led the government to impose controls via zoning based on 
the number and degree of new cases. Support by foreign factors (Biden’s US$1.9tn COVID-19 relief bill, rise in 
global commodity prices, etc.) and efficient control over COVID-19 by the government helped the market to keep 
moving upward in February 2021. In March 2021, the SET rose further, supported by upward earnings revisions for 
2021 after many companies reported better-than-expected earnings in 4Q20. The market moved sideways in April 
2021 and May 2021, pressured by Thailand’s third wave of COVID-19, with far more new cases than the previous 
waves, leading the government to again impose more severe restrictions. However, the market was supported by 
better-than-expected 1Q21 earnings in banks and most big-cap shares. In the first half of June 2021 the market 
continued to rise, bolstered by new relief measures and the start of mass vaccinations but in the second half of 
the month to the end of July 2021, the market fell dramatically owing to increasingly severe COVID-19 infections. 
New clusters were increasingly found in new areas, especially at factories and in construction worker camps. 
Daily new cases made new highs each day in the month, prompting the authorities to tighten containment 
measures. Another cause for the market's decline in July 2021 was the announcement of capital increases by 
many publicly traded firms in the energy industry. The SET closed July 2021 at 1,521.92.
