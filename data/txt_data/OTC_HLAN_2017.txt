Another Year of Achievement
Heartland BancCorp
Solid, consistent and exceptional – these words accurately depict the financial performance of Heartland BancCorp throughout its 29-year history, 
as supported by compounded annual growth rates of 10% in shareholders’ equity and 12.7% in net income for the 29-year period.  2017 marked  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME 
another year of solid, consistent and exceptional financial performance for Heartland BancCorp, representing the most profitable year in history.   December 31, 2017 and 2016 Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
Net income for 2017 was impacted by a one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in additional tax expense of 
$541,000 or $0.29 per diluted share, due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.  Following this one-time expense, net

12 LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
A Timeline for Coming Home
When space and efficiency are challenged, Heartland Bank answers with a bold and innovative state-of-the-art Corporate Center to 
anchor the strategic demands of the 21st century. Breaking ground with a horse and plow like his father, Scott McComb surrounded 
himself with his associates as he took the first ceremonial slice into what would become the Heartland Bank Corporate Center. The 
pictures below represent a very small pictorial diary of a project that was several years in the making.
