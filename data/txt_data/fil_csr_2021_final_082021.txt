You mentioned technology as the 
third sustainable investing theme. 
How might that apply to Fidelity’s 
own operations?
There are two components related to our technology theme. 
One is around digital inclusion and access to the internet. 
The other refers to the behaviour of people and companies 
on the internet. Both are critical aspects of what might be 
termed the emerging field of digital ethics. 
COVID-19 has revealed our immense reliance on technology, 
and digital ethics is about how companies do the right 
thing in our increasingly digital world: are there policies 
and practices that consider ethical digital behaviour and 
outcomes? Are there disclosures and transparency to  
ensure that investors can understand the materiality and  
the risks of these issues? 
Our sustainable investing framework for digital ethics 
incorporates six pillars: cybersecurity; data privacy and 
governance; ethical AI; misinformation; online welfare; and 
digital inclusion. We have been engaging on digital ethics 
topics with many of our investee companies, primarily but  
not exclusively those in the tech sector. 
Within Fidelity, digital ethics is equally important. We are 
investing in security infrastructure and bringing together 
working groups dedicated to implementing the highest 
standards in these areas. In particular, we are paying close 
attention to matters relating to data privacy and governance, 
cybersecurity and ethical AI.

OVERVIEW 2024 GOALS ENVIRONMENT WORKPLACE SUPPLY CHAIN COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE
For the residual emissions we can’t eradicate, we plan 
to implement carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures 
to achieve net zero based on best practices. These 
include nature-based solutions or proven carbon capture 
technology. Carbon removal activities must pass the test of 
being genuinely permanent, are not double-counted and 
do not inadvertently result in higher emissions in another 
area. Therefore, we are considering third-party options to 
independently verify CDR activities.
As of July 2020, a quarter of global carbon emissions 
and more than half of the global economy were covered 
by net-zero commitments, according to the Race to Zero 
Campaign supported by the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change. Net-zero commitments are 
no doubt an important development to meet the goals of the 
Paris Agreement. However, that is just the beginning - how 
companies achieve these commitments may be more vital 
for a truly lasting impact. We want to continuously challenge 
ourselves, and we hope this will inspire others to stretch their 
environmental targets.

can make monthly charitable contributions deducted on a

Fidelity pays all administrative fees, so the charity receives 
the entire amount. For employees, Give As You Earn (GAYE) 
allows more efficiency due to the automation and the tax 
benefits. Our GAYE programme currently is available in the 
UK, and we are aiming to expand it to other countries. 
Employee volunteering
For each employee, we offer two paid volunteering days 
a year. In 2020, many events were cancelled due to social 
distancing measures. However, we were able to replace 
some of these with virtual volunteering events and other 
activities that complied with social distancing restrictions. 
In Luxembourg, we found a way to complete an outdoor 
refurbishment that local charity Stemm vun der Strooss (which 
translates to ‘people from the street’) relied upon to continue 
its services for the homeless. We first split the number of 
volunteers into two teams to minimise contact. One team 
cleaned and prepared the terrace, followed by a second 
team responsible for painting it. Throughout the pandemic, 
employees also supported the charity by donating clothing, 
sleeping bags and hygiene products, among other 
necessities for the homeless. Then to enable the charity’s 
employees to work from home, they donated IT equipment.

Global corporate citizenship
The difficulties from social distancing restrictions to manage the spread of COVID-19 severely impacted our ability to hold 
fundraising events and volunteer for charity. Nevertheless, many of our colleagues found ways to help their communities 
through volunteering days during the pandemic. Read some of their stories below and in the following pages.
UK
Word for word: Teaching children to read during lockdown
Dozens of volunteers in the UK regularly spend about 30 minutes a week during 
term time to tutor children to read online. 
Through the charity TutorMate, the volunteer and the child log on to its secure 
platform to read together. As many schools have been closed during the 
pandemic, it has been more difficult for the volunteers to support the children. 
Some families do not have the technology in their homes to support home 
schooling. Others may be classified as vulnerable, so tutoring sessions may not 
be appropriate in a home environment. 
Despite these challenges, Kingswood corporate citizenship committee members 
Susan White and Jo Andrews have been working with TutorMate to help 
connect as many volunteers as possible with the children with whom they are 
paired, with appropriate safeguarding in place. According to one parent, “My 
daughter’s reading tutor Prady is amazing. He is endlessly patient and somehow

Prady Kapoor, Director - Fidelity Business Consulting, also benefits from the 
rewarding experience. “She is an absolute delight to speak with and keeps  
me on my toes,” he said. “Watching her progress week by week makes me  
feel so proud.”

In 2020 and 2021, Poncin mentored four students from the Luxembourg Business School
