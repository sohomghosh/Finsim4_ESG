unprecedented; 
Category B –  Projects with potential limited adverse social or environmental impacts that are few in number, generally site-
specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures; 
Category C – Projects with minimal or no social or environmental impacts. 
Equator Principles: Scope Project finance that meets the two criteria in ABN AMRO’s Policy for Project Finance and the Application of the EPs require 
the actual application of the EPs: this is project finance within the scope of the EPs. The Equator Principles are also applied
