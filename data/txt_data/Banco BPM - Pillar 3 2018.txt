Introduction
Periodic disclosure provided to the market regarding the Group’s capital
adequacy (Pillar 3 Disclosure)
Supervisory regulations require that banks fulfil specific obligations to publish information
regarding their capital adequacy, exposure to risks and the general characteristics of the
systems for identifying, measuring and managing these risks, and to supply information on
remunerationpracticesandpoliciesinordertostrengthentheroleofmarketdiscipline.
Since 1 January 2014, the prudential supervisory provisions applicable to banks have been
contained in Circular 285 of 17 December 2013, the publication of which was functional to
the start of application of the EU legislation (CRR Regulation EU no. 575/2013 and CRD IV
Directive2013/36/EU)containingthereformsoftheBaselCommitteeaccords(Basel3).
The subject, as specifically noted in Part II, Chapter 13 of the Circular, is directly regulated
by the CRR (Part Eight and Part Ten, Title I, Chapter 3) and by the European Commission
regulations containing the technical rules for regulation or enactment. According to the
CRRRegulation,banksmustpublishtheinformationrequiredatleastonceayear.
It is up to the same entities to assess, on the basis of the significant aspects of their activities,
the need to publish some or all of the information required more frequently, in particular on
thecompositionofOwnFundsandcapitalrequirements.
The Banco BPM Group, created on 1 January 2017 by the merger between former banking
groups Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano, already authorised by the
Supervisory Authority to use internal methods to calculate capital requirements for credit risk
(former Banco Popolare and from 31 March 2018, BPM spa, merged by incorporation with
the Parent Company Banco BPM as of 26 November 2018), market risk (former Banco
Popolare, Banca Aletti and Banca Akros) and operational risk (former Banco Popolare,
Banca Aletti, SGS and BP Property) believes it is appropriate to continue preparing interim
reports, also in accordance with the EBA guidelines ("Guidelines on materiality, proprietary
and confidentiality and on disclosure frequency under Articles 432(1), 432(2) and 433 of
Regulation(EU)No575/2013").
The present document, entitled Disclosure to the Public by Entities, constitutes fulfilment of
the aforementioned regulatory obligations and is drawn up on a consolidated basis. All

Risk management objectives and policies
Introduction
The Banco BPM Group and the companies that belong to the same seek to respect criteria
ofprudenceandreducedexposuretoriskintheirbusinessactivities,asregards:
i. theneedforstabilityintheexerciseofbankingactivities;
ii. sustainabledevelopmentintheareasitoperatesin;
iii. theirinvestors’profile.
The process to manage and control the risks assumed by the Group is coordinated by
Banco BPM Spa in its dual role as Parent Company and the company where all of the main
functions of common interest to the entire Group or to some Subsidiaries are centralised,
based on specific service agreements. This is to ensure harmonised and consistent
management at the Group level, guaranteeing effective customer relations, service quality
andsoundriskmanagement.
The fundamental role in controlling risks deriving from Group activities falls to the Parent
Company's Board of Directors, which establishes strategic guidelines, approves risk
management policies, assesses the degree of efficiency and adequacy of the internal
control system and guarantees a suitable level of internal communication and discussion.
Pursuant to the Banco BPM spa By-law, the Board of Directors has established an Internal
Control and Risk Committee, which provides support to the Board with regards to internal
controlrisksandsystems,withresponsibilityforoverseeingtheentireGroup.
Additionally, specific Steering Committees have been set up within the Parent Company
which, in some cases, involve the presence of management from subsidiaries as members
of these steering committees. In particular, worthy of note in terms of risk management and
monitoring are the Risk Committee, Finance Committee and the New Products and Markets
Committee.
The Banco BPM Group’s total risk appetite is determined using the Risk Appetite Framework,
whichisgovernedbytheRiskAppetiteFramework(RAF)Regulation.
With a view to suitably pursuing its objectives - with the overall objective of sound and
prudential management - in addition to specific organisational safeguards (regulations,
systems, processes, resources etc.) and the availability of adequate capital, the risk
governance process is also based on a system that encompasses company values, as well
as on the effectiveness and the efficiency of the chosen organisational model, which help
containexposuretoriskand/ortominimisetheimpact.
In particular, development and dissemination of an integrated risk culture at all levels is
envisaged, in relation to the various types of risks and extended throughout the entire
Group. In fact, training programs are developed and implemented to increase employee
awareness in terms of responsibilities relative to risks, so as to not limit the risk management
7
process to specialists or audit functions. This makes it possible to create an environment
favourable to guaranteeing that significant risks and factors which could increase them are
promptlyidentifiedandmanaged.
Organisation of Risk Governance
Board of Directors
With a view to being able to count on an adequate system to control and manage
business risks, the Board of Directors, the Internal Audit and Risks Committee and the Board
of Statutory Auditors, which oversee the functioning of the internal audit system, have been
assignedthefollowingtasks,establishedinthecurrentArticlesofAssociation.
Pursuant to article 24.2.2, letter d) of the By-law, the Board of Directors is reserved the non-
delegable responsibility for defining and approving: (i) the Risk Appetite Framework; (ii) the
guidelines of the internal control system, so that the main risks relating to the Company and
its subsidiaries and to transactions of greater significance are correctly identified, as well as
adequately measured, managed and monitored, also establishing criteria relating to the
compatibility of said risks with the sound and correct management of the Company; the
Board of Directors is also responsible for approving (i) the establishment of corporate audit
functions, assigning the relative tasks, responsibilities as well as the procedures for the
coordination and collaboration of the same, the information flows between functions and
between the latter and corporate bodies; (ii) the adoption of internal risk measurement
systems.
When drawing up the strategic, business and financial plans, the Board of Directors
establishes the nature and the level of risk that are compatible with the sound and correct
managementoftheCompanyandtheGroup.
Definition of the Group's risk appetite occurs annually as part of the Group's Risk Appetite
Process.
In particular, in 2018 the Group's Risk Appetite Framework was implemented and refined,
withtheaimofdefiningtheBancoBPMGroup'sriskappetite.
In addition, authorisation was received from the European Central Bank (i) to use internal
risk management systems (AIRB models) to measure capital requirements relative to
consolidated credit risk, as well as (ii) to use an internal model to calculate market risk
capitalrequirements.
For assessment and consulting activities relating to the internal audits and the monitoring of
corporate risk management, the Board of Directors has the support of the Internal Audit
andRisksCommittee(hereinafteralso“AuditCommittee”),setupwithinthesame.
For further details on the activities performed by the Board of Directors, please refer to the
“Report on corporate governance and ownership structures - 2018” published on the
companywebsite.

Optimal composition of the Board of Directors
The candidates for the position of Board Member on the first Board of Directors of Banco
BPM were indicated in the proposed merger drawn up and approved by the management
bodies of Banco Popolare and of BPM pursuant to art. 2501 of the Italian Civil Code and
submitted to the approval of the respective Shareholders’ Meetings pursuant to art. 2502 of
theItalianCivilCode,on15October2016.
The optimal qualitative-quantitative composition of the Board of Directors was established
bythemanagementbodiesofBancoPopolareandofBPMon24May2016,inadocument
entitled “Preliminary analysis of the qualitative-quantitative compositions of the Board of
Directors and of the theoretical profile of candidates for the position of Board Member of
the company resulting from the merger between Banco Popolare - Società Cooperativa
and Banca Popolare di Milano S.c.ar.l.” (“BoD Composition Analysis Document”), made
available to the Shareholders’ Meetings as above, requested to approve the planned
merger.
At the meeting on 30 January 2017, the Board of Directors of Banco BPM deemed the
composition of the current Board of Directors to be in line with the qualitative-quantitative
optimal composition for the outlined in the Board of Directors Composition Analysis
Document.
Quantitative composition of the Board of Directors
ThecompositionoftheBoard ofDirectorsisofcentralimportance fortheeffectivefulfilment
of the crucial duties assigned to this body by law, Supervisory Provisions and the Articles of
Association.
The number of members must be proportionate to the size and complexity of the bank’s
organisational structure, in order to effectively exercise management and control over all
companyoperations.Therefore,itshouldnotbetoolargeor,conversely,toosmall.
With reference to its numerical composition, the Banco BPM By-law establish that the Board
of Directors be composed: (i) until the End of the First Term in Office (date of the
Shareholders’ Meeting called to approve the financial statements for FY 2019), by 19
(nineteen)members;and(ii)aftersaidTerminOffice,by15(fifteen)members.
It should be noted that the prospect of a Board of Directors initially composed of 19
members is aimed at ensuring that, at least during its first term, the Group can benefit from
the contributions of the larger number of individuals able to provide essential knowledge
duringtheestablishmentofthenewgroup.
Additionally, the initial size of the Board is to be considered expedient, given that it favours
integrationbetweenthegroupsandgivesthemergeraninclusivevalue.
Terms have a duration of three financial years, and at the end of the transitional period the
Board of Directors will fall to 15 members, in line with that established in the Supervisory
Provisions.

Qualitative composition of the Board of Directors
In terms of quality, the members of the Board of Directors must meet requirements of
professionalism proportionate to the bank’s operating complexity and size - without
prejudice to the fulfilment of requirements for bank representatives pursuant to Art. 26 of
Italian Legislative Decree 385/1993 - taking into consideration the size and specific
characteristicsofthesectorinwhichBancoBPMoperates.
This being said, in order to identify the qualitative composition considered optimal in light of
the specified objectives, the theoretical profiles (including characteristics of professionalism
and, if applicable,independence)ofcandidates fortherole ofBoard Memberareoutlined
intheBoDCompositionAnalysisDocument,andarebasedonthefollowingcriteria:
- extensive and diversified expertise, with a view to ensuring that the management
body of Banco BPM has a balanced combination of profiles and experience that
encourage, in view of the challenges that the Bank will be facing, further areas of
expertise;
- significantandconsolidatedbusinessand/orbankingexperience;
- an equal number of independent directors with a view to ensuring adequate
debatebothwithintheBoardofDirectorsandinitsinternalcommittees;
- balancebetweengenders(Law120/2011).
A)Skillsandexperience
In order to ensure the optimal qualitative composition, the Board of Directors must have
widespreadanddiversifiedexpertise,bothfromamanagerialandprofessionalperspective.
To that end, recall that article 20.1.4 of the Banco BPM By-law establishes that - without
prejudice to the various and/or additional requirements established in the pro tempore
regulations in effect - all members of the Board of Directors must have adequate
experience, obtained through at least five years of administrative and/or management
and/or audit activities, in Italy or abroad, or at least three years as a chairperson, chief
executive officer and/or general manager, at: (i) banks, financial companies, asset
management companies; or (ii) insurance companies; or (iii) companies with shares traded
on a regulated market in Italy or abroad; or (iv) companies other than those mentioned
above which, individually or at a consolidated group level, have turnover exceeding €100
million, as resulting from the most recently approved financial statements. Candidates who
do not have this professional experience may be appointed to the Board of Directors,
provided they do not add up to a majority of members, provided that: (a) they are or have
been tenured university professors for at least five years in legal, corporate, economic or
mathematics/statistics/corporate engineering faculties; or (b) are or have been registered
for at least a year in the Professional Association of Chartered Accountants, Notaries or
Lawyers; or (c) have covered for at least three years administrative level roles in public
administrations or independent authorities with institutional competence in matters
pertinenttobanking,insuranceorfinancialactivities.
10
Therefore, without prejudice to the requirements of professionalism required by the law
(primary and secondary) and by the Articles of Association of Banco BPM for the award of
the position, with regard to requirements of experience envisaged by the articles of
association and taking into account the recommendations of the European Banking
Authority, to ensure the proper functioning of the management body, the directors and, in
particular, in accordance with the BoD Composition Analysis Document, the members
other than “executive directors” must have good knowledge and experience in at least
oneoftheareasofexpertiseindicatedbelow:
- knowledge of the banking sector and of the methods to measure, manage and
control the risks relating to the exercise of banking business activities: acquired
through experience in administration, top management, managerial and/or control
inthefinancialsectorand/oruniversityteaching;
- experience of business management and of company organisation: acquired
through an activity of administration, top management, managerial and/or control
inenterprisesorgroupsofsubstantialeconomicsize;
- ability to understand and interpret financial statement data of a financial institution:

financialsectororthroughprofessionalactivitiesoruniversityteaching;
- corporate expertise (audit, compliance, legal, corporate, etc.) acquired through
experience in enterprises of a significant size, or through professional activities or

- knowledge of the regulation of financial activities: acquired through specific
experience in financial enterprises or supervisory bodies, or through professional
activitiesoruniversityteaching;
- knowledge of the global dynamics of the economic-financial system: acquired

Furthermore, in order to fully cover all of the areas of expertise identified above, to facilitate
the assignment of Board of Directors’ committee positions as well as increase the degree of
knowledge in taking board decisions, in accordance with the BoD Composition Analysis
Document, each area of expertise identified above should be represented in the Board as
awhole.
The Regulations of the Internal Committees, approved by the Board of Directors, also
envisagethatatleastonememberofthe:
i. Audit and Risks Committee must have adequate experience in accounting and
financialareasorinriskmanagement;
ii. Remuneration Committee must have adequate knowledge and experience in
“financialmattersorremunerationpolicies”.
11
B)AppropriatenumberofIndependentDirectors
In relation to independence requirements, recall that article 147-ter, last paragraph,
Legislative Decree 58 of 24 February 1998 (Consolidated Finance Law - CFL) establishes
that, where the Board of Directors has more than seven members, at least two of the
directors must fulfil the requirements of independence established for statutory auditors by
art.148,paragraph3,CFL.
The Corporate Governance Code of Borsa Italiana envisages that “the Boards of Directors
of issuers belonging to the FTSE-Mib must consist of at least one-third of independent
directors and that if this corresponds to a non-whole number, the latter may be rounded
down”.
The Supervisory Provisions envisage that “at least a quarter of members must possess
independence requirements. They must possess adequate professionalism and authority to
ensure a high level of internal debate within the body they belong to and to make a
significantcontributiontothedecision-makingprocessofthesame”.
Articles 20.1.5 and 20.1.6 of the Banco BPM By-law establish, based on best practices, a
number of directors holding independence requirements that exceeds the minimum
establishedintheregulatoryprovisionsandtheCorporateGovernanceCode.
In fact, they establish that at least 9 (nine) Directors, for as long as the Board of Directors
shall consist of 19 directors, and at least 7 (seven) Directors, starting from when said Board
will consist of 15 directors, must be independent directors, by which meaning Directors that
do not have nor have recently had, directly or indirectly, relations of a professional, equity,
personal or other such relation with Banco BPM or subjects associated with the same, such
astoaffecttheautonomyoftheiropinions.
To that end, in compliance with the notion of independent director indicated in the Banco
BPM By-law2, a Director is in any case not considered as an independent director if any one
ofthefollowinghypothesesoccurs:
a) if, directly or indirectly, also through subsidiaries, trust companies or third parties, he/she
controls Banco BPM, or is able to exercise a significant influence over the same, or
participates in a shareholders’ agreement through which one or more parties may exercise
controlorasignificantinfluenceoverBancoBPM;
b) if he/she is, or has been a significant representative in the previous three financial years -
meaning by such: the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the “executive directors” and
“executives with strategic responsibilities” - of Banco BPM, of a subsidiary of the same with
strategic significance or of a company under joint control with Banco BPM, or of a
company or an entity which, also together with others through a shareholders’ agreement,

remuneration (with respect to the “fixed” emolument of a non-executive director of Banco
BPM, the remuneration for participation in Banco BPM Board committees, any attendance
fee for presence at meetings) from the Company or from a subsidiary or Parent Company,
including therein any participation in incentive plans linked to company performance, also

f) if she/he has, or has had, directly or indirectly (for example through subsidiaries or those in
which he/she is a prominent representative, or as partner of a professional studio or of a
consultancy company), a significant professional, equity, business or financial relationship in

- with Banco BPM, a subsidiary of the same or with any of the respective prominent
representatives;
- with a party which, also jointly with others through a shareholders’ agreement,
controls Banco BPM, or - in the case of a company or entity - with the relative
prominentrepresentatives;
- withcompaniesunderjointcontrolwithBancoBPM;

separated, relative or similar to the fourth degree of kinship, the cohabitant as if married
and cohabitant family members) of the directors of the New Parent Company or of the
directors of companies controlled by the same, of companies that control it and of those

I) if he/she falls into any other category that fails to meet the requirement of independence

At its meeting on 1 January 2017, the Board of Directors approved the criteria to determine
the significance of the cases indicated in article 20.1.6, paragraph 1, letters e) and f) of the
By-law.
For full details on independence requirements, please see the “Report on corporate
governanceandownershipstructures-2018”publishedontheBancoBPMwebsite.

C)Balancebetweengenders
In compliance with legal and regulatory provisions governing equal access to the
management and control bodies of companies listed in regulated markets (Italian Law no.
120 of 12 July 2011 and Consob Resolution no. 18098 of 8 February 2012) and in compliance
with the Articles of Association, up until the date of the Shareholders’ Meeting called to
approve the financial statements for FY 2019, at least 7 (seven) members of the Board of
DirectorsofBancoBPMmustbelongtothelessrepresentedgender.
In any event, the same Articles of Association of Banco BPM envisages in article 20.1.2 that
thecompositionoftheBoardofDirectorsmustguarantee,incompliancewiththeprovisions
of Italian Law no. 120 of 12 July 2011 and any subsequent amendments, as well as by
legislation and regulations in force at the time, a balance between genders for the period
envisagedbythesamelaw.
Role and availability of directors
To correctly carry out the duties assigned to them, all Board Members of Banco BPM are
expectedto:
- be fully aware of their strategic role and the powers and obligations inherent in the
functionscarriedout;
- haveadequateauthorityfortheroletobecovered;
- dedicate adequate time and resources to their overall role, also taking into account
any roles within internal Committees, guaranteeing consistent attendance and
proactivityatmeetings,andconsultingmaterialssupportingagendaitems3.
The specific skills and authority of the Board Members must in any case be such so as to
guarantee a significant contribution to board discussions to contribute to taking decisions in
linewiththecompany’sinterest.
Pursuant to art. 20.1.6 of the Articles of Association of Banco BPM, the following are
considered“executivedirectors”:
i. the chief executive officer, directors to whom the Board of Directors have granted
powers pursuant to article 2381, paragraph two of the Italian Civil Code (and article

The connotation of “executive”, for the members of the Board of Directors, in the event that
they are also members of the Executive Committee, is connected, in terms of the
Corporate Governance Code of Borsa Italiana, with the required frequency of Committee
meetings and the subject of the relative resolutions. In addition, the Bank of Italy’s
Supervisory Provisions define as an “executive member”, inter alia, all directors on the
ExecutiveCommittee.
It should also be noted that the Chairman of the Board of Directors is considered as “non-
executive” insofar as he/she does not have delegations of management and is not a
member of the Executive Committee, participating at the meetings of the same, without
voting rights, for the sole purpose of ensuring an effective exchange of information
between the strategic supervisory function and the management one (art. 26.3 of the
ArticlesofAssociation).
It should also be noted that, pursuant to art. 20.3.2 of the Articles of Association of Banco
BPM - without prejudice to any other reasons for incompatibility envisaged by the legislation
in force at the time - persons that become members of management bodies or employees
of companies or belong to groups whose business activities are in competition with those of
Banco BPM or the Group to which the same belongs, with the exception of central trade
institutions or investee companies held directly or indirectly by Banco BPM, may not be
appointedtotheposition,andifappointed,willberemovedfromoffice.
The above prohibition is not applicable when the participation in management bodies of
other banks relates to the representation of trade organisations or associations of the
bankingsystem.
Number of director, management and control positions held by members of the
management body
The table below shows the total number of director, management and control positions
held by each member of the Board of Directors in other listed, financial, banking, insurance
or significantly sized companies; the latter have been identified in light of the provisions set
forth in the “Regulations on the limits to the number of positions that may be held by
DirectorsoftheBancoBPMGroup”adoptedbyBancoBPM.
The detailed list of positions is attached to the “Report on corporate governance and

acquired and to make evaluations (both in terms of risk and of the value of the
assets)independentlyfromotherapplications;
- an (integrated) summary presentation of corporate risks and, therefore in this way, a
greater understanding, by the Corporate bodies, of the main problems highlighted
bythesecond-levelinternalauditsystem;
- the adoption of prompt and consistent corrective measures relating to the problems
andtherelativeprioritieshighlightedbythesecond-levelinternalAuditFunctions.

Risk profile and risk management and measurement systems
The Board of Directors of the Parent Company Banco BPM approved the Risk Appetite
Framework (hereafter, also "RAF") in the first quarter of 2018, through which the strategic
supervision body defines the risk levels the Group is willing to take on in pursuing its strategic
objectives.Specifically,Circular285requirestheadoptionofanRAFwhich:
- assigns the Body in charge of Strategic Supervision the task to define and approve
the risk objectives, the tolerance thresholds (where identified) and the risk
governancepolicies;
- envisagestheadoptionofanintegratedapproachtoriskmanagement;

- states the timing and the procedures to be followed to update the RAF (due to
changes in legislation, in the reference scenario or internal context) as well as the
tasks of the Bodies and of all of the corporate functions involved in process
definition.
The Risk Appetite Framework of the Banco BPM Group is comprised of the following basic
elements:
1. “Governance”, which defines the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved
andtheinformationflowsbetweenthesame;
2. The“systemofmetrics”,whichsummariseriskexposure;
3. The“systemofthresholds”,throughwhichtheriskappetiteisdefined;
4. The “escalation process”, which is activated with different intensities and parties
whendifferentthresholdsaresurpassed;
31
5. The methodological document “Risk Appetite Statement (RAS)”, which contains an
analytical description of the calculation procedures for the metrics and definition of
therelativethresholds;
6. The “tools and the procedures”, which support the representation and the operating
managementoftheRAF,includingwhatareknownas"MostSignificantTransactions"
(MST).
The RAF is a tool that makes it possible to establish, formalise, communicate, approve and
monitorthe risk objectives that theGroup and theindividual relevant LegalEntities intend to
take on, in a unitary manner. To that end, thresholds and risk sectors are identified which
makeitpossibletoidentifybeforehandthelevelsandtypesofrisktheGroupintendstotake
on, further specifying the roles and responsibilities of the bodies and company functions
involved in the management of these risks. The Group must guarantee that the operating
version of the RAF is used and interiorised and represented a guideline when setting
processes in place, such as, by way of example, the Strategic Plan and the Budget, as well
as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The framework is also used as an operating tool in
thecontextoftheRecoveryPlanandwhendefiningRemunerationPolicies.
The general principles that guide the Group’s risk assumption process can be summarised
asfollows:
 activities are performed taking into account the risks assumed and the controls set in
placetomitigatethesamefromashortandmedium-longtermperspective;
 particular attention is paid to capital and liquidity adequacy and to the credit
quality of the portfolio, also in the light of the introduction of new legislation and of
regulatoryrestrictionsimposedbytheSupervisoryBody.
The RAF indicators make use of the Risk Identification Process, taking into account
regulatory indications regarding Risk Governance. All significant risks identified during the
process are considered when defining the Risk Appetite Framework, and specific indicators
are identified for monitoring purposes. Specifically, the RAF for the Group has identified
various indicators, classified based on the main types of risk: Pillar I and Pillar II Capital
Adequacy,LiquidityAdequacy,CreditQuality,Profitability,Operations/Actions.
The indicators that summarise the Group’s risk profile in these areas have been divided into
2 levels, differentiating between strategic indicators, which enable the Board of Directors to
guide the Group’s strategic decisions, and operational indicators, in order to integrate and
anticipatethedynamics-wherepossible-ofthestrategicindicators.Specifically:
 the Strategic RAF is a set of metrics and thresholds that enable the Group’s risk
strategy to be defined and monitored; it includes a limited and exhaustive number
of indicators, which express the risk appetite approved by the Board of Directors and
representthesummaryperformanceoftheoverallriskprofile.
 The Management RAF is a set of metrics that makes it possible to integrate and
detail the strategic indicators and anticipate developments in the risk profile. These
metrics make it possible to identify specific aspects of the main company processes
32
and as a rule can be monitored more frequently to serve as an early warning of
possiblecriticalsituations.
The system of thresholds for the strategic indicators envisages the definition of the
followinglimits:
 Risk Target (medium/long-term objective) generally the risk objective defined in the
Business Plan at the Group level. Indicates the level of risk (overall and by type) that
theGroupwishestobeexposedtoinordertoachieveitsstrategicobjectives.
 Risk Trigger: the threshold, differentiated by indicator, which when exceeded
activates the various escalation processes established in the Framework. The Risk
Trigger is also determined using stress tests. In line with the Trigger values, a system of
limitsusedforoperatingpurposesisalsodefined"RiskLimits").
 Risk Tolerance: this is the maximum permitted deviation from the Risk Appetite; the
tolerance threshold is set in such a way so as to ensure that the Group has sufficient
margins to operate, even in conditions of stress, within the maximum risk that may be
assumed.
 Risk Capacity: this is the maximum level of risk that the Group is able to assume
without infringing regulatory requirements or other restrictions imposed by the
shareholdersorbytheSupervisoryAuthority.
On the other hand, for Management Indicators, only the Risk Threshold is identified. When
risklimitsareexceeded,specificescalationprocessesarepromptlyactivated.
The Risk Function, in collaboration with Planning and other relevant Functions, develops the
RAF, by providing support to the Body in charge of management, from a legislative and
operating perspective, consistent with strategy, business plans and capital allocation in
ordinary conditions and in situations of stress. The RAF is updated at least once a year, also
intheeventofchangesintheinternalandexternalconditionsinwhichtheGroupoperates.
From an operating perspective, risk prevention activities are also found in the process to
manage Most Significant Transactions (relating to credit, finance, credit assignment and
other transactions) and leverage operations, which primarily involve the Risk Function,
which must express a prior and non-binding opinion on all transactions that meet the
identificationcriteriaestablishedandregulatedinternally.

The Banco BPM Group also defines the Risk Appetite Framework not just at Group level, but
also for all significant Legal Entities, by means of cascading the risk appetite to individual
company level, taking the respective core businesses into account, also with a view to
guaranteeingthatlimitsatconsolidatedlevelwillbecompliedwith.
Reporting and Monitoring Activities
The risk monitoring and control activities performed by the Risk Function seek to ensure, at
Groupandindividualcompanylevel,theharmonisedsupervisionoftheriskswithinitsscope,
by guaranteeing appropriate and timely information to the Corporate Bodies and to the
Organisational Units involved in managing said risks, ensuring the development and the
continuousimprovementofthemethodsandthemodelsadoptedfortheirmeasurement.
To that end, the Parent Company prepares reports for the company bodies on a monthly
basis, in line with the Group's internal policies. As regards integrated risk reporting, the Risk
FunctionanalysesthemainriskstowhichtheGroupisexposedandperiodicallyassessesthe
risk profile of the RAF indicators, comparing them with the thresholds established in the
framework, providing historic and detailed analyses to explain the trends, the focus areas,
andtheareasforimprovement.
Benchmarking analysis of the main Italian banks allows the company bodies and top
management to have more integrated view of the Group's risks. Activities performed within
the context of the reporting system ensure that appropriate and timely information reaches
the company bodies, senior management, internal audit functions and the organisational
unitsinvolvedinriskmanagement.
Pillar I and Pillar II Capital Adequacy
To provide its management team and the Supervisory Authority with a complete and
informed disclosure,whichconfirmstheadequacyofitsownfunds,thefirstdefenceagainst
the risks assumed, the Banco BPM Group assesses its capital situation from a current and
future perspective, both as regards Pillar I and Pillar II, based on Basel 3 rules (which are
applied through CRR/CRD IV) and the specific guidelines that the banks receive from the
SupervisoryAuthority.
As regards Pillar I, the Group’s capital adequacy entails continuously monitoring and
managing the capital ratios, calculated on the basis of the information provided by the
Accounting and Financial Statements Function through the application of the rules
established by Supervisory Regulations, in order to verify compliance with regulatory limits
and to ensure that the minimum capitalisation levels required by Supervisory Regulations
are maintained. Said ratios are also estimated at the time of the Budget or Strategic Plan
and their consistency with the thresholds set within the Risk Appetite Framework and the
estimatesmadeintheCapitalPlanisverified.
As regards Pillar II, the Risk Function is tasked with coordinating the internal process to
determine the Group’s capital adequacy, in accordance with regulatory provisions, and
with making the current and forward-looking estimates summarised in the annual ICAAP
(InternalCapitalAdequacyAssessmentProcess)report.
34
The ICAAP, regulated internally by specific regulations and circulars, enables the Group’s
exposure to be assessed as regards Pillar I risks (credit, counterparty, market and
operational) as well as that to other relevant risks identified internally or on the basis of the
regulatoryprovisionsthroughtheRiskIdentificationprocess.
Assessment of capital adequacy, within ICAAP, occurs through verifying compliance with
Pillar I and II capital requirements (capital reserves calculated as the difference between
Available Financial Resources [AFR] and capital requirements, calculated through
advanced methodologies developed internally and validated by the competent company
function),makinguseoftheRiskAppetiteFrameworkandqualitativeelements.
Theresult oftheICAAP, performed onamulti-yearbasis, takes into considerationsimulations
performed both with an eye to regulatory requirements and through the application of
internal management methodologies. Simulations are performed under normal business
conditionsandalsotakeintoaccountresultsderivingfromtheapplicationofstresstests.
Regulatory and operational liquidity adequacy
The Banco BPM Group manages the adequacy of its liquidity and funding profile both from
a current and future perspective, as regards Pillar I and Pillar II, based on Basel 3 rules and
theguidelinesoftheSupervisoryAuthority.
The Group’s regulatory liquidity adequacy is continuously monitored through two ratios: the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which promotes the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk
profileofthebankbyensuringthatithassufficienthigh-qualityliquidresourcestoovercome
a situation of acute stress lasting one month; the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which
seeks to encourage longer-term resilience by providing the bank with greater incentive to
fund its activities by utilising more stable sources of funding on a structural basis. This
structural ratio has a time horizon of one year and was developed to guarantee that assets
and liabilities have a sustainable maturity structure. These ratios are integrated into Pillar II
by metrics developed internally, complementary to the regulatory liquidity ratios and stress
analyses.
The Group has also provided itself with a strategy for the Internal Liquidity Adequacy
Assessment Process (ILAAP). In fact, the ILAAP is the internal process the Banco BPM Group
uses to management and monitor liquidity risk at the Group level and to assess the
adequacy of its short-term and medium/long-term liquidity. The ILAAP also includes an
annual internal self-assessment of its overall liquidity risk management framework, aimed at
continuousimprovementofthesame.
Categories of risks monitored and managed by the Banco BPM Group
The risk identification process is the starting point for all of the Group's strategic processes.
This process is a structured and dynamic path that is performed annually at the Group level
by the Risk Function, involving the Bank's top management and the main companies in the
Group, making it possible to identify the main risk factors and emerging risks to which it is or
could be exposed, ensuring the process is effectively performed and disseminated within
35
the Group. Process output is in the form of a risk map, a list of the risks judged significant for
theBancoBPMGroup.
The risk map represents the basis for defining the RAF indicators and the risks contained in it
must be considered in the ICAAP, both from a quantification perspective, where possible,
and in terms of a description and assessment of the measures set in place to prevent and
mitigate risk. The Parent Company guarantees the measurement, monitoring and
management of the capital requirements for each type of risk and guarantees the
supervision and the quantification of the capital resources available to the Group to cover
its risk exposure with a view to complying with the regulatory obligations of Pillar I and Pillar II
ofBasel2.
Morespecifically,thecentralisedmanagementofGroupcapitaladequacy,whichentailsa
comparison between the amount of available capital resources and the capital
requirements resulting from the risks to which the group is exposed, from a current and
future perspective, in normal and stressed conditions, is performed by implementing the
ICAAP process, as required by the “Supervisory Provisions for banks” (Circular 285/2013, as
updated).
The following paragraphs illustrate the main characteristics of the risks considered significant
by the Group following the implementation of the Risk Identification process in the last
quarterof2018.
Credit and counterparty risk
Definition and objectives
This is the risk that a debtor of the Group (including counterparties in financial transactions
involving over the counter derivatives - which in this case more specifically involves
counterparty risk, for which please refer to the specific section on "Counterparty risk") does
not comply with their obligations, entirely or partially, or that their credit standing
deteriorates.
Concentration risk (dealt with below) is closely connected to credit risk, and derives from
exposure to counterparties, groups of associated counterparties, or counterparties in the
same economic sector or which carry out the same business, or are located in the same
geographicarea.
As to guarantees, the residual risk (which is illustrated hereinafter) is managed associated
with the possibility that generally accepted techniques to mitigate credit risk used by banks
maybelesseffectivethanexpected.
Internal regulations have been developed to handle this risk, which govern the processes of
acquisition, finalization and management of guarantees in a standardised way throughout
theentireGroup.
The assessment of possible losses that could be incurred by the Group with regard to a
single credit exposure or the total loan book depends upon many factors, among which
the general economic conditions or those of specific production sectors, the change in the
rating of single counterparties, structural and technological changes within borrowing
36
companies, a deterioration in the competitive position of counterparties, the possible
mismanagement of companies or borrowing counterparties, the growing indebtedness of
households,structuralmacroeconomicfactorsandotherexternalfactors,suchaslegaland
regulatoryrequirementsapplicabletothismatter.
TheBancoBPMGrouppursueslendingpolicyobjectivesaimingat:
- supporting the growth of the business activities operating in its market territories, with a
strong customer relationship focus on small and medium sized companies and on
households;
- diversifying its portfolio, limiting loan concentration on single counterparties/groups, on
singlesectorsofeconomicactivityorgeographicalareas;
- applying a homogeneous credit management model, based on internal IT and
regulatory rules, methodologies, processes and procedures that have been
standardisedforallGroupbanks.
The loan book monitoring, carried out by the Parent Company’s Credit Function, is focused
on the performance analysis of risk profile of economic sectors, geographical areas,
customer segments and types of granted credit lines, as well as on other analysed spheres
of action, allowing the definition of possible corrective actions at central level. Reports
produced are submitted periodically for the attention of the Parent Company’s collective
bodies.
Group lending policies
The organisational model of the Group with respect to its lending activity complies with the
followingprinciples:
 the Parent Company guarantees a consistent management, planning, coordination
and control of the credit process and of the associated risks for the Group banks and
companies, by defining policies, procedures and processes, roles and responsibilities,
assessment criteria, adequate organisational, operational, IT and training tools and
makingsurethattheyareproperlyadopted;
 the banks and operating companies of the Group autonomously, i.e. within the set limits
established by the Parent Company, assess and approve the loans they grant directly,
and retain the ownership of the relationships and of the related profit and risk
components.
With the aim of optimising credit quality and minimising global credit risk costs for the Group
and the single companies, under the organisational model, the Parent Company’s Credit
Functionisinchargeofguiding,coordinatingandcontrollingcreditpolicies.
ToactuallyimplementtheGroupcreditmodel,theParentCompany:
 defines Group credit policies in keeping with the strategies, risk appetite and economic
objectives specified by the governance bodies, with the aim of guiding the overall size,
riskprofileanddiversificationoftheloanbook;
 determines the principles and rules for assigning decision-making responsibilities and
37
creditauthorities,takingthemostsignificantcreditdecisions;
 prepares line controls and risk management controls, carrying out monitoring on overall
loanbooktrends;
 defines“countryrisk”limits.
With respect to the procedures to assess creditworthiness, and the approval and
management of positions, each lending company adopts its own structure of decision-
making bodies and defines the delegated powers to authorise loans, in keeping with the
guidelinesissuedbytheParentCompany.
Within the context of the Group, guidelines are established relative to the assumption of
credit risk, in order to avoid excessive concentration, limit potential losses and guarantee
credit quality. In particular, when credit is granted, the Parent Company serves to guide,
governandsupporttheGroupthrough:
 lending rules, regulating credit risk-taking modalities with respect to customers in the
grantingphaseaswellasinthelendingformalisationphase;
 the lending ceiling, that is, the global limit for loans that Group companies can grant to
largerriskgroups;
 theformulationof“priorapprovals”onthetotalamountofloansthatcanbegrantedto
asinglecustomeroragroupofcustomersborrowingfromtheGroup.
A careful assessment of creditworthiness is carried out also for institutional counterparties
(banks and investment banks), in particular with regard to financial transactions (trading of
derivativesandmoneymarketinstruments,lending,investmentsinbonds).
The key principles underlying the management of risk originating from these counterparties,
asindicatedabove,areasfollows:
 centralisationofthelendingprocessintheParentCompany;
 internal system for the assignment and periodic review of ratings (in addition to those
issuedbyinternationalagencies);
 systems that measure and control credit exposure and compliance with limits on a daily
basis;
 minimisation of the risk generated by OTC derivative contracts by making extensive use
of risk mitigation mechanisms (Credit Support Annex agreements with all main
counterparties).
Management and control processes and instruments
TheBancoBPMGroupmakesuseofadetailedcombinationoftoolstomonitortrendsinthe
quality of the loan portfolio, which also includes internal ratings. These latter are calculated
using differentiated models, estimated specifically by customer segment (large corporate,
midcorporateplus,midcorporate,smallbusinessandprivate).
The rating plays a role in deciding which are the competent bodies to approve loans and
contributes to guide the decisions of loan managers when classifying positions based on
38
theirperformance.
Rating plays a central role in the processes of disbursement, monitoring and performance
management. When specificcases occur,theRatingand Performance Desk organisational
unit must examine the positions and decide whether to change the rating (“override”
process).
As to the internal lending limits of the Banco BPM Group, in addition to the compliance with
risk concentration limits defined by supervisory regulations, whenever a pre-set loan
threshold is exceeded in case of major customers, the Group Credit Function must approve
maximum plafond or the Parent Company’s competent boards must express their decision
thereon.
The Parent Company also decides the country classification and the Group-wise maximum
exposurelevelforeachcountry.
The credit risk estimate models are developed under the responsibility of the Risk Models
unit. Amongst these, in particular, the following rating models were authorised in 2012, for
the use for prudential supervisory purposes until 31-12-2017 (for further details relating to
rating models and their scope of application for reporting purposes, please refer to the
“CapitalAdequacy”and“Creditrisk-IRB”sectionsbelow):
 five rating models, used to estimate the Probability of Default (PD), respectively of the
segmented Business counterparties (“first acceptance” and monitoring): Large
Corporate, Mid Corporate Plus, Mid Corporate, Small Business and Private (“rating
model”segmentation);
 two Loss Given Default (LGD) models, for estimating the loss rate in the event of default
of the Corporate and Private Individual counterparties respectively for the different
statuses(performingandnon-performing).
Following the acceptance of the model change application made by the former Banco
Popolare in May 2015, the ECB authorised the Group to make the model changes
requested incorporating a series of temporary prudential measures into the calculation of
non-performing RWAs, of non-performing expected losses and on the retail EAD. These
measures would haveexpired afterauthorisationto usethe new A-IRB modelsfor retail EAD,
LGD defaulted assets and ELBE. Starting from the reporting of 31-03-2017, and for the whole
of2017,thefollowingprudentialmeasures(add-ons)werethereforemadeoperational:
 applicationofacreditconversionfactorof100%forIRBRetailexposures:
 calculationofnon-performingIRBRWAthroughapplicationofaregulatoryformula
 obligation of a floor for non-performing expected loss corresponding to 45% of gross
exposures.
On 16 February 2018 Banco BPM S.p.A. received authorisation to use internal models to
calculate capital requirements for the post-merger Banco BPM portfolio. This authorisation
includes, in addition to the updated PD model, a new EAD retail model, and the ELBE and
LGDDefaultedAssetmodel.Followingtheauthorisation, BancoBPM must used theADDs on
39
(LGD parameter multipliers), until all the findings outlined by ECB in the authorisation letter
havebeenresolved.
These models have been used to calculate capital requirements starting from the reports
issuedon31March2018.
The Risk Models organisational unit has also developed additional models to estimate risk
factors(PD,LGD)usedsolelyformanagerialpurposes.
Thecredit risk parameters (PD, LGDand EAD),determined usinginternalmodels,areused in
management reports. Credit risk monitoring at the portfolio level is done through the use of
a statistical risk estimate model VaR, falling in the category of "default models", applied on
a monthly basis of the credit exposures held by the banks in the Group, limited to loans to
ordinaryresidentperformingcustomerswithintheAIRBscopeoftheGroup.
The model used makes it possible to estimate economic capital against credit risk, taking
into account portfolio concentration, and with a hypothesis of joint non-compliance by
counterparties, under a pre-established situation of significant macroeconomic variables.
Theconfidenceintervalusedis99.9%andthereferencetimehorizonisoneyear.
In particular, the operating capital absorbed by counterparties is determined along a
“Monte Carlo” approach that simulates a sufficiently high number of scenarios to provide a
good empirical approximation of the theoretical distribution of loan book losses in an
adversecontext.
For exposures other than those relative to performing ordinary resident customers in scope
of AIRB, control over risks is achieved by means of the use of supervisory regulatory metrics
(Standard/Irb). Finally, the portfolio model is periodically stress tested to verify how sensitive
the credit risk of the Group portfolio is to extreme changes (albeit plausible) of one
(sensitivity analysis) or more (scenario analysis - historic and hypothetical) economic and
financialfactors.
With regard to the measurement of Counterparty Risk specifically, please refer to the
qualitativedisclosureinthesectiononthattopic.
Main management and control structures
The Parent Company's Credit Function defines credit rules which must be followed by the
companiesintheGroupandformulates,inlinewiththeeconomicstrategiesandobjectives
approved by the Parent Company Board of Directors, the relative credit policies with the
aim of guiding the overall size, classification and diversification of the Group's loans
portfolio,withthegoalofminimisingthecostofcredit.
The Rating Desk and Performance structure implements overall monitoring of performance
management, identifying requirements and actions to be implemented to support the
same. For "large customers" of the Group, the Function suggests reliability ceilings to be
submitted for approval to the relevant decision-making bodies and expresses an obligatory
but non-binding "preventive opinion" on the maximum amount of loans which can be
grantedtocustomerswithexposuresexceedingpre-establishedthresholds.
Within the Credit Function, the Rating Desk is tasked with examining and assessing possible
40
changes to ratings on positions that could be contradictory and refers to the Risk Function
forananalysisandpossiblemeasuresontheratingmodels.
Risk Models involves the Credit Risk Function for the management and control of credit risk,
throughthefollowingareas:
 Credit Risk Models: have the mission to develop and maintain the methods, models and
metrics for the measurement of credit risks, with particular reference to the internal
models for the calculation (i) of the risk factors (PD, LGD, EAD), as well as (ii) the credit
risk according to a managerial approach (credit-VaR): these models are intended (i) to
calculate the minimum capital requirements on an individual and consolidated basis in
compliancewiththatauthorised,fromtimetotime,bytheSupervisoryBodyaswellasto
calculatetheinternalcapitalwithaviewtoPillarIIofBaselII;
 Credit Risk Measurement and Control: has the task of measuring, monitoring and
controlling absorption of capital against credit risk, from a regulatory (Pillar I of Basel III)
and managerial standpoint (Pillar II of Basel III), also with reference to the exposure limits
defined from time to time. It also works together with the competent company offices
for the determination of the weighted assets for the risk for the entire loan book as well
as in order to estimate the full fair value of performing mortgages and loans that
incorporatesPDandLGDriskmeasures.
Coverage and mitigation policies
The Banco BPM Group always keeps a watchful eye on the acquisition of loan collaterals
andsecurities,i.e.theuseoftoolsandtechniquesthatmitigatecreditrisk.
When deemed necessary, the typical bank guarantees are acquired, namely mortgages
on properties, collaterals on securities in addition to personal guarantees issued by the
guarantors.
In general, the decision on the acquisition of a guarantee is based on the customer’s
creditworthinessandonthecharacteristicsofthetransaction.
The system for the recording of collateral property for loan transactions, which also allows
forperiodicallyrevaluingtheproperty,hasbeenconsolidated.
The value of the financial collateral is constantly and automatically monitored, so as to
compare the present value of the collateral to the initial one, and to allow the manager to

Market risk
Definition
Market risk consists in the possibility of generating fewer revenues than expected,
impairment in balance sheet items or capital losses on financial positions held, due to sharp
adverse changes in market conditions and, specifically, in interest rates, share prices,
exchange rates and the associated volatilities and correlations (general risk), or due to
eventsthatmayimpairtheissuer’srepaymentcapacity(specificrisk).
Risk management strategies and processes
With regard to trading books, market risks stemming from the commercial activities
performed by Group banks are systematically transferred over to the subsidiary Banca
Akros. The commercial banks hold only residual positions as compared to the above books,
for specific needs and purposes of individual banks or those directly linked to commercial
activity.
The organisational model adopted by the Banco BPM Group for trading books is based on
thecentralisation:
 of Treasury positions in the Parent Company’s Finance function in charge of
coordinating the management of short term liquidity and interest rate risk and
exchange risk positions within the Group, and of managing the Proprietary portfolio to
optimise its overall risk/return profile, by diversifying risks across different asset classes of
financialinstruments;
 in the subsidiary Banca Akros of the risk positions and the operating flows associated
withsecurities,currency,OTCderivativetradingandotherfinancialassets.
Structures and organisations involved in risk management
Control of financial risk management, with the aim of identifying the type of risks, defining
and implementing the risk measurement methods and controlling limits at strategic level is
centralisedwithintheRiskFunctionforthemainGroupcompanies.
For the identification, measurement, management and operating control of the risk
positions of the Banks of the Group, the Group’s Finance function and Banca Akros make
use of position-keeping and risk control systems that provides a constant control over
exposure levels and over the accurate verification of compliance with the operating limits
definedbytheCorporateBodies.
In case of financial instruments with very complex and innovative structures, these models
are complemented by pricing and sensitivity measurement models developed internally,
that consider product characteristics and the dynamics of the underlying market variables.
For each new pricing model, or any changes in models already in place, validation tests
arecarriedoutbytheRiskFunction.
This consists in the verification and validation of the pricing model being analysed, so it can
be used in Front Office systems and to control and measure risks. The quality of a model is
subsequentlyverifiedonacontinuousbasis,throughappropriaterevisionofmodels.
42
The sale of each new product and its inclusion on the product catalogue are systematically
preceded by an in-depth analysis of the measures required to ensure correct product
management in terms of accounting, laws/regulations, settlement, pricing and risk
management. These activities are coordinated by a specific Product Innovation
Committee,composedofthemanagersofthemainstructuresinvolved.
The Committee assesses and analyses observations made by individual operating and
governing structures and, if necessary, deals with issues identified. It approves proposals for
new products, possibly formulating its comments and/or operating instructions by drawing
up a specific document, accounting to a predefined template, which becomes the
“product information sheet” setting forth all the features of the new products and the
certificationoftheeffectiveexaminationandassessmentofrelatedrisks.
Measurement method
Generic risk on the trading book is monitored on a daily basis using deterministic indicators,
suchasriskexposure,sensitivity,andprobabilisticindicatorsaswellasValueatRisk(VaR).
In particular, these indicators are considered the most appropriate instruments to ensure an
effective and precise measurement and control of market risks generated by exposures to
complexderivatives,alsofromaregulatorystandpoint.
ValueatRisk(VaR)isasyntheticmeasurementofrisk,expressingthemaximumpotentialloss
caused by market changes under normal conditions. The methods used to calculate VaR
are part of the class of historic simulation VaR models. Historical simulation is a method used
to construct the distribution of probability for a risk factor, based on past changes in the
same. No hypotheses are adopted regarding the type of distribution for the fact, but a
(discrete) distribution is generated starting from the current value of the factor and
hypothesising changes (generally logarithmic) identical to those seen in the historical series.
Another significant characteristics of the model adopted is "full joint evaluation" of
transactions. Each transaction is repriced with the market parameters obtained through
application of the historical scenarios for each of the past days. These parameters are
jointly changed, in this way capturing the effects of interactions between them when
measuringfinancialinstruments.
In order to gauge the risk deriving from the credit component implicit in bond positions,
credit derivatives and bond futures, the VAR method based on historic simulation
implementedalsoincludesthecreditspreadriskfactor.
The risk estimate is made with a confidence level of 99% and a time horizon of one day. The
observation period is 250 days. Correlations used are those implicit in the historical scenarios
applied to estimate the empirical distribution of values in the trading book. Risk is defined as
the maximum between those calculated with equally weighted scenarios and those
calculated giving greater weight to more recent scenarios, through the use of a lambda
decayfactorof0.99.
In order to verify overall capital adequacy, the Risk Function also takes a monthly
measurement of market risk with a confidence level of 99.90% and a time horizon of 10
businessdays.
43
The reference aggregate for calculating VaR is the trading book. The model currently in use
entirely covers generic and exchange rate risks and specific risk, both for debt securities
and equity securities. The risk factors considered are interest rate, stock market, exchange
rateandcreditspread.Correlationanddividendriskarealsoconsidered.
To estimate the component of issuer risk implicit in positions in bonds in the banking book
the VaR method relating only to the credit spread risk component, associated with
Incremental Default Risk, is used at management level and for the purpose of assessing
capital adequacy with a view to Pillar II. This method, based on a portfolio approach with a
multi-factor threshold, estimates the maximum potential loss deriving from the joint default
ofseveralissuersintheportfolio.
VaR reports are prepared, through which monitoring is ensured at Group level, at single
bank level, by organisational unit, and by trading book. Said reports are sent to the Bank
HeadOffice,theFinanceFunctionandtoInternalAudit.
As to scenario analyses (“stress testing”), simulations are implemented by applying
predefined shocks to the main risk factors, in order to assess the current and prospective
level of capital adequacy as required by the Basel II Pillar II regulations. The stress testing
calculation models were reviewed and optimised, envisaging historic, scenario and
discretionarytests.
The VaR method described above is used to measure managerial risks. As from 30.6.2012,
the Group obtained validation of the internal model for the purpose of calculating the
capital requirement, for the generic and specific risk of the equity instrument, the generic
risk of debt securities, the options and UCITS risk. At present, this methodology is applied to
Banco BPM and Banca Akros. For each Group company that holds a trading book specific
maximum daily VaR and capital absorption limits are defined, determined according to the
metricsillustratedabove.
Compliance with these limits is generally required of the Managing Directors of each
company and, on a top-down basis, of the specialist departments, which periodically
report to their respective Board of Directors, highlighting any overruns and the actions
implementedtorestorenormalconditions.
The Parent Company’s Risk Function is in charge of monitoring compliance with these limits,
whichiscarriedoutonadailybasis,promptlyreportinganyoverruns.
Moreover, the Risk Function notifies the companies involved and the parties in charge of risk
management when 90% of the risk limits (warning level) has been reached, regarding the
consequentassessmentsandpossiblecorrectivemeasures.
Development of market risk
The development of market risk assumed by the Group, measured using internal operating
metrics, is summarised by the following quantitative information, which is also included in
PartEoftheNotestotheConsolidatedFinancialStatements2018.
44
The Value at Risk (VaR) measurement considers the interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign
exchange risk and credit spread risk, as well as the benefit of correlation between the risks.
Correlationanddividendriskarealsoconsidered.
The performance graph and the VaR figures (confidence level 99%, holding period 1 day)
are shown below for 2018, referring to the trading book for supervisory purposes of the
BancoBPMGroup.

As can be seen, the relevant risk component is that relative to the specific risk on debt
securities, due to the presence of Italian financial and government securities. Changes in
these securities account for trends in the Group's overall risks. More specifically, in the
second half of the year, the portfolio indicated a greater level of risk, to be attributed both
toexposuresandtothevolatilityoftheItaliangovernmentsecuritiesmarket.
Further to the validation of the internal model for the determination of the capital
requirement on market risks, back testing is carried out on a daily basis with the aim of
checkingthequalityoftheVaRmodeladopted.
45
With reference to the banking book, the Group also assesses the exposure to default and
migration risk of the rating classes of the debt securities classified as HTC and HTCS using a
method which involves calculating the VaR spread to take into consideration the Migration
component and Incremental Default Risk (IDR) to capture the Default component, with a
view to complying with the instructions set forth in the European Fundamental Review
DirectiveofMarch2014.
The most important factor that impacted risk in 2018 was the trend in the volatility of the
credit spread, which had repercussions on the specific debt securities risk component,in

Operational risk
Definition
Operational risk is the risk of suffering losses caused by inadequacy or failure attributable to
procedures,humanresourcesandinternalsystems,orcausedbyexternalevents.
This definition does not include strategic or reputational risk, but does include legal risk,
understood as the risk of infringing laws and other regulations, of failing to comply with
contractual and non-contractual liabilities, as well as other disputes that may arise with
counterpartiesinthecourseofbusinessactivities.
Themainsources ofoperationalriskare: thelowreliabilityofoperationalprocesses -interms
of effectiveness/efficiency - internal and external frauds, operational mistakes, the
qualitative level of physical and logical security, inadequate IT structure compared to the
size of operations, the growing recourse to automation, the outsourcing of corporate
functions when not adequately structured and monitored, the excessive concentration of
the number of suppliers, changes in strategies, incorrect personnel management and
trainingpoliciesandfinallysocialandenvironmentalimpacts.
Risk management model and organisational structure
Also in compliance with the relevant regulations, the Banco BPM Group adopted an
operational risk management model that illustrates the management methods and the
people involved in risk identification, measurement, monitoring, mitigation and reporting. In
particular, the model refers to centralised oversight functions (governance and control
functions) and decentralised oversight functions (coordinators and ORM contacts, which
are specifically involved in the key processes of collecting operating loss data, continuously
assessingtheoperatingscenarioandforecastingexposuretorisk).
ThismodelisgovernedbyaspecificGroupRegulationapprovedbytheCorporateBodies.
To identify and measure operational risks, the Banco BPM Group has defined an internal
methodologybasedonquantitativeandqualitativeanalysisaccordingtoVaRlogic.
The quantitative assessment is based on internal loss data, gathered through a loss
collection process. This data is combined with external loss data pertaining to the Italian
bankingscenario(inbound flowsoftheDIPOconsortium,set upbythemajorItalianBanking
Groups within the ABI - Italian Banking Association), and on data deriving from the risk self-
46
assessment, a structured process involving the heads of the various organisational
structures. The purpose of this component is to complement the available quantitative
data, specifically in the cases where no historical loss data exist that may indicate the risk
level associated with specific events (mainly with reference to rare, high impact events) or
where certain corporate processes or operations are being revised in such a way as to
change the level of exposure, generally assigning a forward-looking outlook to the overall
assessments. The qualitative findings of the continuous monitoring and assessment of the
internalandexternaloperatingscenariosarealsousedinthisprocess.
Reporting system

Concentration risk
Concentration risk derives from credit exposures to counterparties, groups of counterparties
that are connected to one another or belong to the same economic sector or carry out
thesamebusinessorbelongtothesamegeographicalarea.
Concentration Risk is monitored and managed at centralised Group level, by the Credit
Function, which covers the role of guiding the lending activities and credit policies for the
Group banks and companies. Specifically, it formulates lending policy strategies, regarding
the composition of the Group loan book, also in terms of maximum exposure for each
significantaspect,suchasgeographicalarea,industry,counterpartytype,etc.
For large customers, the Credit Function specifically assesses the reliability of the
counterparties and monitors the credit lines granted. It also analyses the overall and
organic structure of the loan book and its composition/diversification. Finally, it periodically
producesreportshighlightingexposuresrelativetomaincustomers.
Concentration risk is quantified by the Risk Function, specifically as part of the models used
toestimatecreditriskonperformingbooksofresidentcounterparties.
Interest rate risk on the banking book
The interest rate risk incurred by the Banco BPM Group relating to its banking book mainly
derives from the exercise of its core business as an intermediary involved in transforming
maturities (see the “Interest rate risk on positions in the banking book” section, which should
bereferred to formore details onthenatureoftherisk, themanagement strategies and the
measurementmethodsusedbytheGroup).
An organisational model has been adopted by the Group for risk management and control
which involves the centralisation of the activities in specific structures specially delegated
bythesubsidiaries.Inparticular:
 interest rate risk management is delegated to a specific structure of the Parent
Company’sFinancefunction;
 riskmeasurementandcontrolisassignedtotheParentCompany’sRiskModelsfunction.
At Group level, a specific maximum limit is defined, applied to end-of-month VaR reporting
48
(“probabilistic” indicator with a holding period of 12 months and a confidence interval of
99.9%).
Two“deterministic”limitsarealsoenvisaged,alsoatGrouplevel;theseindicatorsarebased
on the measurement of the impact of an instantaneous and parallel market interest rate
shock - shock which varies based on the interest rate level (currently +/- 0.40%), - on the
expectedinterestmarginat1yearoftheentitymonitored,basedonthecapitalsituationat
thetimeof recording, and ofaninstantaneous and parallel shock of+/-2.00%, applyingthe
floor from the EBA guidelines, of the rates applied to the economic value of the banking
bookinrelationtoownfunds(supervisorycapital).
The bodies of the Parent Company are required to comply with these limits. They
periodically report to the Board of Directors, highlighting any overruns and the consequent
actionsimplementedtorestorenormalconditions.
The Parent Company’s Risk Models function is in charge of controlling compliance with
these limits. It reports any overruns to the parties delegated to their management, in
addition to reporting situations where the alert value of said limits have been reached, as
anearlywarningofapossiblefutureoverrun.
In accordance with standard management practices and with internal and external
regulations, Banco BPM also conducted periodic stress testing, applying shocks, parallel or
not parallel, to the curves of the currency rates utilised in the banking book. Furthermore,
within the risk self-assessment process, the impact of historic and hypothetical scenarios
(specific stress) is assessed, processed according to a method-based approach which
takes into account the specific features of this risk, as well as a scenario common to all the
risks(jointstress).
Risk Models also works with the structures in charge of risk management in order to identify
andassesscorrectivemeasuresaimedatcompliancewiththelimits.
Liquidity risk
LiquidityriskistheriskthattheGroupisnotabletomeetitspaymentcommitments,andthat
this is certain or envisaged with reasonable certainty. Liquidity risk is usually broken down
into two types of risk: funding and liquidity risk, namely the risk that the Group is unable, in
the short term (liquidity) and in the long term (funding) to meet its payment commitments
and its obligations in an efficient manner due to the inability to raise funds without
prejudicing its core business activities and/or its financial situation; market liquidity risk,
namely the risk that the Group is not able to liquidate an asset without incurring losses on
the capital account due to the poor depth of the reference market and/or due to the
timingwithwhichthetransactionmustbeperformed.
Risk management model
The Banco BPM Group had adopted internal policies and procedures with a view to
stabilising the governance, management and control of liquidity and funding risk, and the
InternalLiquidityAdequacyAssessmentProcess.Thepoliciesadoptedseekto:
 pursue the sound and prudent management of liquidity in accordance with the
49
legislation in force and with the risk-return objectives approved in the Group’s Risk
AppetiteFramework;
 ensure that the Group operates with stable levels of liquidity and collections that are
adequate to cover current payment commitments, future envisaged and unexpected
commitmentsandtofundtheGroup’sbankingbusinesswithstability.
Liquidity risk management and control policies are regulated in a specific internal
Regulation, approved by the Management Bodies, which establishes the roles and
responsibilities of corporate bodies and function, the approaches and the metrics to
identify and measure the risk, the guidelines for stress testing and the Liquidity Contingency
Plan (LCP), namely a plan of countermeasures that can be set activated in the event of
internalorexternalliquiditypressurefortheGroup.
Liquidity risk is continuously managed and monitored as part of the Internal Liquidity
Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which is the process adopted by the Group to
identify, measure, monitor, mitigate and report its liquidity and funding risk profile from an
operationalperspective.
As part of this process, the Group also conducts an annual self-assessment as to the
adequacy of the risk profile and of the overall framework to manage and measure liquidity
risk with regard to governance, approaches, IT, measurement tools and reporting. This self-
assessment is a fundamental aspect of the process to ensure the continuous internal
improvementofliquidityrisksupervision.
The results of the internal adequacy assessment are reported to the corporate Bodies and
sentforinformationpurposestotheSupervisoryAuthority.
Liquidity governance is centralised within the Parent Company, which also plays the role of
lenderofthelastinstanceforthesubsidiaries.
Reporting and monitoring system
The Group measures and monitors exposure to liquidity and funding risk with regard to the
currentandfutureriskprofile,innormalconditionsandinstressedconditions.
More specifically, the Group uses a monitoring system that includes both short-term liquidity
indicators (a time horizon from intra-day to twelve months) and medium-long term ones
(beyond twelve months). To this end, regulatory metrics are also used (regulatory schedule
that includes LCR, NSFR, ALMM) and metrics developed internally (internal schedule that
includes survival period, gap ratio, indicators of funding concentration). The latter include
the use of models to estimate behavioural parameters and/or optional parameters specific
to the characteristics of the Banco BPM Group, with a view to integrating the regulatory
metricsintermsoffrequencyorthescopeoftheanalysis.
Liquidity risk monitoring and control is conducted on a daily basis (short-term liquidity) and a
monthly basis (medium-long term liquidity). The objective is to monitor changes in the risk
profile, verifying its adequacy with respect to the Risk Appetite Framework and the
operatinglimitsenvisaged.
Stress testing is conducted on a quarterly basis, in order to test the Group’s resilience to
50
unfavourable scenarios and the liquidity estimates that may be generated with
countermeasures (the so-called action plan, an integral part of the Liquidity Contingency
Plan)thatmaybeadoptedintheeventofastressscenario.
The Group also has a reporting system to provide the Bodies, Committees and relevant
corporate functions with evidence of monitoring activities, guaranteeing a prompt
informationwithregardtotheGroup’sexposuretoliquidityandfundingrisk.
Residual risk
This is the risk that generally accepted techniques to mitigate credit risk used by the Group
may be less effective than expected. To quantify it, the relevance of different types of
Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) tools is assessed in terms of reducing the capital requirement
obtainedthankstotheiruse.
The Banco BPM Group adopts a guarantee management process, which seeks to identify
risk mitigation techniques to be used to limit exposure to credit risk, and to define methods
tobeimplementedintheacquisition,managementandenforcementofguarantees.
The processes adopted aim to increase the effectiveness of the coverage acquired, in
terms of the actual possibility for the banks to enforce the guarantees and the recoverable
value, in consideration of the recovery time frames and costs. For more information on the
credit risk mitigation techniques and an assessment of their effectiveness, see the section of
thisDisclosuredocumentdevotedtothistopic.
Risk deriving from securitisations
This is the risk that a securitisation transaction carried out or structured by a company in the
Group does not fully reflect the risk assessment and measurement decisions in line with the
Group's policies; this risk does not consider self-securitisation transactions, and the assets
transferredbutnotderecognisedforaccountingpurposes,alreadyincludedincreditrisk.
The Group Finance Function is also in charge of monitoring those elements which could
generate unexpected negative impacts on profit for the year, such as portfolio selection
and definition of transaction structures, and review of legal documentation, including
contractualandtortclauses.
More details regarding the treatment of this risk are provided in the specific section of this
disclosuretothepublic.
Equity investment risk
This is the risk resulting from changes in the value of equity investments held in the banking
bookduetomarketvolatilityorthestatusoftheissuer.
Risk governance is performed with regard to financial instruments representing equity
securities in the banking book, and stock investments made by the Group consolidated in
equity.
The quantification of absorbed capital takes place using a VaR methodology
(variance/covarianceapproach)insteadofthestandardregulatoryapproach.
51
Business risk
Current and future risk linked to a potential fall in the interest margin with respect to the
objectives set, due to low customer satisfaction with the products and services provided by
theGroupduetoadversemarketconditions.
Specifically, the Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in fee and commission income
linked to investment services. This risk is managed and mitigated through commercial
policies and actions aimed at building customer loyalty, so as to favour stable service
provisions with a steady income flow, and at maintaining a high value added, innovative
businessofferinlinewithourcustomers’presentandfutureneeds.
The Risk Function quantifies business risk according to a Pillar II view, based on an EaR -
Earnings at Risk management methodology, which estimates the portion of net interest and
other banking income at risk (net of components already measured in connection with
other risk types), applying risk ratios determined on a historical analysis of volatility of said
component.

Strategic risk
This is the current or future risk of a potential decrease in profits or capital as a result of
incorrectmarketpositioningorerroneousmanagementdecisions.
More specifically, it represents the risk that the competitive/strategic positioning choices do
not produce the expected results, penalising the achievement of short and long-term
economic and capital objectives, or even provoking unwanted decreases in profitability
levelsandcapitalsoundness.
In this view, strategic risk related to the possibility of failure of company projects, which
results in management disruption and inertia in the bank when faced with unforeseen
marketdynamics.

Reputational risk
This is the risk linked to a negative perception of the bank’s image by customers,
shareholders, investors, financial analysts and the Supervisory Authorities, which could have
a negative influence on the bank’s ability to maintain or develop new business
opportunitiesortocontinuetohaveaccesstosourceoffunding.
In addition to internal regulations, which govern general conduct for all Group employees,
the various corporate functions monitor this risk, for the purpose of controlling quality and
customer satisfaction objectives, managing complaints submitted by customers, managing
relations with shareholders, and overseeing relations with financial analysts and institutional
investors. This type of risk is also subject to managerial assessment carried through a specific
internal assessment process that allows simultaneous verification of the Group's reputational
positionandquantificationofaspecificmeasureofeconomiccapital.
52
Real estate risk
Current and future risk resulting from changes in the value of the property held by the
Group. Operationally, the Risk Function estimates the economic capital in the presence of
this risk by means of a Value at Risk statistical method with a confidence interval of 99.9%
and a one year holding period, a variance-covariance approach, applied to the market
value of the real estate owned by the Group (including that purchased under financial
lease).
Said method is applied with reference to non-operating assets; instead the standard

The concept of country risk is broader than that of sovereign risk, since it refers to all
exposures irrespective of the nature of the counterparties, be they natural persons,

Compliance risk
Compliance (or non-conformity) risk as defined by the supervisory provisions for banks (see
Circular 285/2013) is the risk of incurring legal or administrative sanctions, significant financial
losses or reputational damage as a result of the violation of binding rules (laws, regulations)
or self-regulatory systems (e.g., Articles of Association, codes of conduct, corporate
governancecodes).
This type of risk is overseen at Group level, by the Parent Company’s Compliance Function.
More specifically, the Compliance Function uses specialist structures and facilities to
oversee compliance with rules regarding the exercise of banking, credit and brokering
activities, conflicts of interest, investment services, transparency as regards customers and,
more generally, provisions to safeguard consumers, governance and remuneration areas,
ICTanddataprotectionandsecurity.
53
The structures and facilities oversee compliance with the rules through structures/resources
specialised:
 in the prevention of compliance risk (ex ante), which is implemented through a
process that continuously measures and analyses legislative changes and provides

Stress testing
The Banco BPM Group has implemented a detailed stress testing framework, meaning a set
of quantitative and qualitative techniques by means of which the bank assesses its
vulnerabilitytoexceptionalbutplausibleevents.
The framework also includes guidelines relating to the application of stress scenarios as well
astherolesandresponsibilitiesofthecorporatefunctionsandCorporateBodies.
55
The framework for long-term forecasting and for stress testing adopted by Banco BPM
comprises a coordinated set of methods, processes, controls and procedures that define
the main variables to be used from a forward-looking perspective for estimates in normal
and adverse conditions, for planning and risk management purposes as well as regulatory
andmanagerialones.
The stress tests seek to verify the effects on the risks of the bank due to specific events
(sensitivity analysis) or joint changes in a series of economic-financial variables in cases of
adverse scenarios (scenario analysis), with reference to individual risks (specific stress tests)
orinanintegratedmanneronseveralrisks(jointstresstests).
The analysis process is based on quantifying the firm-wide impacts relating to stress testing,
whichenableaglobalassessmentintermsoftheBank’sriskprofile.
These tests allow identification of the risk factors that contribute more than others to these
negative results and consequently allow implementation of loss-limiting strategies when
thesescenariosoccur.
Consistent with the aims of analysis and the principle of proportionality, the Group
periodically performs stress tests with specific objectives associated with the main company
processes,specifically:
 DefinitionoftheRiskAppetiteFramework(RAF)
 RecoveryPlan
 Strategicandoperationalplanning
 Quantificationofoperatinglimits
 CalculationofIFRS9ECL
 InternalCapitalAdequacyAssessmentProcess(ICAAP)
 InternalLiquidityAdequacyAssessmentProcess(ILAAP)
 LiquidityContingencyPlan
 Short-TermExercise(STE).
"Vertical" stress tests carried out at the individual portfolio and risk levels are also included in
the context of stress tests, associated with sensitivity or scenario analyses, which also have
theaimofidentifyingpotentialconcentrationsofrisk.
In addition, specific stress tests are performed with managerial and regulatory goals
(Supervisory Stress Test), these latter in accordance with the schedules issued time to time
bythesupervisoryauthorities.
In particular, in 2018 the Group was involved in executing the EU-Wide Stress Testing
coordinated by the EBA/ECB, aimed at verifying the Group's resilience under a basic and
adverse scenario. The type, complexity and level of detail of stress test methodologies are
determined in line with the Group's strategic guidelines and business model, taking the
trendinthemacreconomiccycleintoconsideration.
56
The Group uses these tools to support other risk management and measurement
techniques,withaviewto:
 providing a forward-looking perspective of the risks, of the relative economic and
financial impacts, assessing the overall soundness of the bank in the event of adverse or
alternative scenarios with respect to the benchmarks, therefore providing support for

It should also be noted that the Risk Function produces ad hoc reports on
processes/assessments on the specific request of the Supervisory Authority, Corporate
BodiesorHeadofFAC.
Information flows on risks (Compliance area)
With reference to compliance risk, in 2018 the Compliance Function continued to refine
andstrengthenitsreportingmodel.
The model designed in accordance with the “Principles for the effective aggregation and
reporting of risk data” issued by the Basel Committee for Bank Supervision in January 2013,
was finalised withaview to meetingtheinformationneeds ofthe addressees, strengthening
itsabilitytopresentsummaryriskdata.
58
Furthermore, with a view to making the production of periodic reporting more efficient, the
process of automatic generation for the Compliance dashboard is currently active. The
model was designed at the Group level and at the level of the individual legal entities, to
take the specific organisational, regulatory and business aspects of each entity into
account.Nevertheless,intheParentCompanyreportinglines,theinformationanddataare
also represented on an aggregate basis, in order to have an overall vision at Group level of
corporateriskphenomenaandofcomplianceactivities.
ComplianceReportingmeetsinparticular:
- the need for Top Management Bodies and Supervisory Authorities to understand the
planning and reporting activities of the management cycle of the Compliance
function;
- riskgovernance,control,monitoringandmanagementpurposes;
- the need to support the Management decision-making process on any corrective
actiontobetakeninthepresenceofhigh-risksituations;
- standardised coordination and guidelines for the supervisory activities of the audit

Adequacy of risk management measures
Following the merger on 1 January 2017, the Banco BPM Group has acted to rationalise,
harmonise and improve the tools, methods, processes and IT systems of the two former
banks in compliance with Prudential Supervisory provisions (CRR Regulation, CRD4 Directive,
Circular 285), beginning a multitude of projects over time aimed at improving its risk
managementandcontrolsystem.
The risk management and control tools (models and controls) used were found to be suited
tomeasuringandmitigatingtheriskstowhichtheGroupisexposed,alsointhefutureandin
stressedconditions.
Measurement models are periodically submitted to Internal Validation and Internal Audit.
Risk measurement methodologies have been brought to the attention of the competent
corporate bodies - the Board of Directors, the Risk Committee and the Board of Statutory
Auditors. In addition, the breadth and detail of the ICAAP and ILAAP and the
complexity/granularity of the Risk Appetite Framework make it possible to cover all risk
governance areas. Measurement, monitoring and reporting to the control bodies are
carriedoutperiodicallytoguaranteerapidandeffectiveriskmanagement.
59
Consistency between the overall risk profile and business strategies
The Banco BPM Group operates in such a way as to guarantee full integration between
strategic/operationalplanningandtheriskmanagementsystem.
More specifically, as regards “Regulations for ICAAP” and “Regulations for liquidity risk,
funding risk and ILAAP”, a connection has been established between the annual budget
processes and the preparation of the strategic plan and the processes to prepare ICAAP
and ILAAP Reports, regulating and illustrating, also through the exchange of specific
information flows, the collaboration and coordination between the Risk Function and the
Planning and Control Function. In the same way, the roles and collaborative activities
amongst the above-mentioned Functions are defined within the “Risk Appetite Framework
(RAF) Regulation” in order to define, update, verify and manage the Group’s Risk Appetite
Framework.
During 2018, within the ICAAP, the sustainability of the Group's long-term projections was
verified. The capital adequacy assessments were conducted on a prospective and stressed
prospectivebasis.
Theprocess,documented withincompanyregulations,requirestheapplicationofa“basic”
and various alternative “stress testing” scenarios by the Study and Research Function
(PlanningandControlFunction).
The prospective internal capital and the stressed internal capital is calculated for each risk,

With reference to the scope of related companies, we also note that, in the context of the
process of reorganising the Bancassurance segment, in March, Banco BPM completed the
purchase of 50% + 1 share of Avipop Assicurazioni and of Popolare Vita, taking its stake in
the capital of the two companies to 100%. On the same date, Banco BPM sold 65% of the
capital of Avipop Assicurazioni and of Popolare Vita to Cattolica Assicurazioni. As a result of
these transactions, the Group now holds a 35% stake in the capital of the two companies,
which, in May, changed their names to Vera Assicurazioni and Vera Vita. These interests
continue to be classified as equity investments in associates and are measured with the
equitymethod.

Transitional arrangements aimed at mitigating the negative impact of the
introduction of IFRS 9 on own funds
Within the deadline provided for (1 February 2018), Banco BPM informed the European
Central Bank that it had exercised the option to fully apply the transitional rules provided for
in the new Article 473-bis of Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013, which extend over time the
impact on own funds deriving from application of the new impairment model introduced
by the accounting standard IFRS 9. These transitional rules provide for the option of
including in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital a transitional positive component for a
percentage of the increase made in provisions for expected losses on loans as a result of
applying the accounting standard IFRS 9. This percentage decreases over five years as
indicatedbelow:
- period from 1 January to 31 December 2018: 95% of the increase made in provisions
forexpectedlossesonloansasaresultofapplyingtheaccountingstandardIFRS9.
The negative impact expected to derive from applying the new impairment model
on own funds is consequently reduced to 5% of the impact that will be recognised
onthebookvalueofshareholders’equityasof1January2018;
- period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019: 85% of the increase made in
provisionsforexpectedlossesonloans;
- period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020: 70% of the increase made in
provisionsforexpectedlossesonloans;
- period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021: 50% of the increase made in
provisionsforexpectedlossesonloans;
- period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022: 25% of the increase made in
provisionsforexpectedlossesonloans.
From 1 January 2023, the impact deriving from first adoption of the accounting standard
IFRS9willbefullyreflectedinthecalculationofownfunds.
Besides the option to make gradual the impact deriving from first adoption of the
accounting standard as of 1 January 2018, the transitional rules provide for the option to
make gradual any impacts that applying the new impairment model will produce also in
the first financial years after first adoption of the new accounting standard, although limited
tothosederivingfrommeasurementofnon-impairedfinancialassets.
The consequent disclosure obligations are complied with through the publication of Table
IFRS9-FLbelow.
For the purposes of the calculation and representation of the aggregates in question,
specificclarificationsissuedbythecompetentauthoritiesarealsoapplied.

Note that, on the basis of that established in article 26, paragraph 2 of Regulation EU
575/2013 of 26 June 2013 (CRR), the value of common equity tier 1 subsequently detailed
takesintoaccounttheeconomicresultattheendoftheyear.
From 1 January 2018, most of the transitional effects provided for in Part Ten of Regulation
(EU) 575/2013 are no longer applicable. At the same time Delegated Regulation (EU)
2017/2395 has come into force; this introduced the new article 473-bis of the CRR, aimed at
mitigatingthenegativeimpactoftheintroductionofIFRS9onownfunds.
At 31 December 2018, Common Equity Tier 1 ( CET1) Capital showed a decrease of
approximately 1,624 million, deriving mainly from an increase in elements to be deducted
andinnegativeprudentialfilters,ofwhich:
- 66millionasthenetresultfortheperiod
- 233millionforfully-deductibledeferredtaxassets;
- 105millionforexcessofexpectedlosseswithrespecttowrite-downs;
- 626 million for significant equity investments and DTAs exceeding the threshold
pursuanttoArt.48CRR;
- 20millionfor“AdditionalValuationAdjustments”.
The total changes in shareholders’ equity reserves reflect, above all, the negative trend in
unrealisedcapitallossesonfinancialassetsmeasuredatfairvalueof593million.
The other reserves, including the negative reserve for the impact of first adoption of the
standard IFRS 9, also include the partial recovery provided for in the new Art. 473 bis CRR
andgeneratedapositivebalanceofapproximately20million.
Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital decreased by 95 million. With own eligible instruments
extinguished for approximately 192 million, the pre-existing items to be deducted for
negativetransitionalimpacts,of97million,werereducedtozero.
InTier2(T2)Capital,therewasanetdecreaseof382million.
Eligible instruments issued by the bank itself decreased by approximately 479 million, owing
to regulatory amortisation and redemptions of securities that had reached maturity, among
thelastallowedunderthegrandfatheringregime.
Items to be deducted showed a positive net balance of 42 million due to the reduction to
zero of negative transitional impacts, which were offset by subordinated loans to significant
investees.
The higher value adjustments on A-IRB credit risks, already mentioned for CET1, resulted in a
surplus compared to expected losses, calculated in Tier 2 within the regulatory limits,
resultinginapositivechangeof56million.

Capital Requirements
Disclosure with respect to Pillar 1 capital adequacy pursuant to Article 92 of the
CRR Regulation
On the basis of current prudential supervisory provisions ("Regulations for the supervision of
banks" - Bank of Italy Circular no. 285 of 17 December 2013), the minimum Total Capital
Ratio is set at 10.5% (including the capital conservation buffer, which is set at 2.5% as of
2019).
Inmid-February2019,BancoBPMreceivedanotificationfromtheEuropeanCentralBankof
the SREP decision containing the outcomes of the annual Supervisory Review and
Evaluation Process (SREP). The capital requirements laid down by the ECB for the year 2019,
intermsofCommonEquityTier1ratio,arepresentedbelow.
BancoBPMGroup’sCapitalRequirements-intermsofCET1ratio 2018 2019
Pillar1Regulatoryminimum 4.50% 4.50%
Pillar2Requirement(P2R) 2.50% 2.25%

BufferOtherSystemicallyImportantInstitution(O-SII) 0.00% 0.06%
OverallCapitalRequirement(OCR) 8.88% 9.31%
The minimum capital requirement is equal to the sum of the capital requirement prescribed
against credit, counterparty, market and operational risks. These requirements, in turn, arise
from the sum of the individual requirements of the companies in the Group’s prudential
consolidation scope, after removing the effects of intra-group relations on credit,
operationalandcounterpartyrisks.
As of 1 January 2017, with the establishment of the Banco BPM Group, the Supervisory
Authority has agreed to the use of internal models employed by the former Banco Popolare
Group and by Banca Akros to calculate the capital requirements of the new Group on their
respectivepre-existingvalidationperimeters.
As of 31 December 2018, the Banco BPM Group is authorised to use its own internal models
tocalculateregulatorycapitalabsorptionwithreferencetothefollowingPillar1risks:
 credit risk (starting with the measurement at 30 June 2012) € the scope concerns the
advanced internal rating based approaches (PD, for both monitoring and
acceptance and LGD) relating to retail and business loans made by Banco BPM
spa. For loan portfolios not falling within the scope of initial AIRB validation, the
standard regulatory approach continues to be applied for prudential purposes.
During 2017, the Banco BPM Group presented a request for an extension to the
European Central Bank, with a simultaneous model change with regards to the
definition of defaults and an updating of the historic series and internal advanced
models (AIRB) for the BPM S.p.A. corporate and retail portfolio, as well as the use of
the EAD model limited to the retail perimeter, for the relative calculations of capital
85
requirements against credit risk. In this context, the Group received authorisation
from the ECB to make use of these models for reporting purposes in the first quarter
ofthefirsthalfof2018,effectivestartingwiththereportingasofJanuary2018;
 market risk (starting with the reporting on 30 June 2007 for Banca Akros and 30 June
2012 for Banco BPM spa and Banca Aletti). During 2018, the Parent Company's
internal model was extended to Banca Akros4. At present, the perimeter includes
generic and specific risk for equity securities and generic risk for debt securities in the
trading book. In 2018, projects were begun to extend the internal model for specific
riskofdebtsecuritiesandexchangeriskfortheBankingBook;
 operating risk: the former Banco Popolare Group had adopted the Advanced
Measurement Approach for the first validation perimeter (relative to the companies
Banco Popolare, Banca Aletti, SGS BP and BP Property Management5, with initial
reporting in June 2014) and the roll-out perimeter shared with the Regulator (with
references to operating segments Aletti Gestielle SGR and BP Leasing Division -
former Banca Italease, initial reporting on 30 June 2016). For the relevant companies
of the Group (parent company and all companies which over time were
incorporated into it, Banca Akros and ProFamily), the former BPM Group had
adopted the Traditional Standardised Approach as of 2008. The other residual
companies of the two former Group had adopted the Basic Indicator Approach as
of 2008. Following the merger date, the Banco BPM Group was authorised by the
European Supervisory Authority to use the combined Advanced Measurement
Approach (AMA), relating to the validated perimeter of the former Banco Popolare
Group (former Banco Popolare segments of the Parent Company, Banca Aletti, SGS
BP, and BP Property Management), the Traditional Standardised Approach (TSA) on
the perimeter of the former Banca Popolare di Milano Group (segments of the
former parent company BPM Scarl, the former BPM Spa, ProFamily and Banca Akros)
and the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for the other residual companies that
comprise the Banco BPM Group. In 2017, the Banco BPM Group began a project to
extend advanced approaches to the former BPM component, for managerial
purposes. As of reporting on 30 June 2018, in line with the decision adopted by the
ECB on the issue, the private banking segments of the former BPM SpA and Banca
Akros, transferred to Banca Aletti, adopted the advanced approach. As of reporting
on 31 December 2018, in line with the decision adopted by the ECB on the issue, the

Qualitative disclosure on countercyclical capital buffer
The imposition of additional capital buffers with respect to the regulatory minima has the
objective of giving banks high-quality capital resources to be used in moments of market
tension to prevent dysfunctions of the banking system and avoid breakdowns in the loan
disbursement process and to cope with the risks deriving from the systemic importance at
the global or domestic level of certain banks. In this context, the counter-cyclical capital
buffer has the aim of protecting the banking sector in the stages of excessive growth of
credit. In fact, its imposition makes it possible to accumulate, during phases of credit cycle
overheating, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which will then be destined to absorb losses in
the descending phases of the cycle (from Circular 285 - Part One – Transposition in Italy of
theCRDIVdirectiveSectionIII–Counter-cyclicalcapitalbuffer).
Entities have an obligation to hold a countercyclical capital buffer equal to their total
exposure to risk multiplied by the bank’s specific countercyclical ratio. The Bank of Italy, like
the other authorities designated by the individual Member States, has an obligation to
determine quarterly the countercyclical ratio of our country and to monitor the congruity of
theratiosappliedbyothercountries,bothEUandnon-EU.
87
Directive 2013/36/EU specifies that the specific countercyclical ratio of an entity is equal to
the weighted average of the countercyclical ratios applied in the countries in which the
significantexposuresoftheentityaresituated.
It should be noted that Bank of Italy set at 0% the countercyclical ratio to be applied to
exposuresheldwithItaliancounterparties,forthefourthquarterof2018.

Disclosure with respect to Pillar 2 capital adequacy pursuant to Article 73 of CRD
IV Directive
The process of assessing capital adequacy supports and supplements the consistency
check conducted under Pillar 1, which requires the verification of the adequacy of Own
Funds intermsof theminimumprudential requirements forcredit risk (including counterparty
risk),marketriskandoperationalrisk.
Significant risks (credit, counterparty, market, interest rate, operational and other measured
risks) are measured using statistic and quantitative methods generally relating to the VaR
technique.
Banco BPM Group has opted for a level of probability (or confidence interval) of 99.90%, in
line with the confidence level of minimum capital requirements established by supervisory
regulations, in order to make the reconciliation with estimates resulting from the application
ofregulatoryapproacheseasier.
The risks are estimated with reference to a one-year horizon, with the exception of market
risks, for which a 10-day holding period is used for market risk on the trading book (the
defaultriskcomponentisestimatedwitha3-monthsholdingperiod).
For Banking Book market risk, a ten day holding period is used for the stock and exchange
component. Risk on the HTC portfolio is estimated with a 6-month holding period. For the
HTCS portfolio, the VaR Spread method includes a 3-week holding period (the risk default
component-IDRisestimatedwitha3monthhorizon).
Forthebankingbookequityinstrumentriskthe,holdingperiodis6months.
The assessment of capital adequacy carried out in the ICAAP context and included in the
Group’s Risk Appetite framework entails, besides the quantification of all the significant risks,
the definition of the measure of total capital used as capital amount to cover the same
businessrisks.
The Group’s Risk Appetite Framework includes indicators that make it possible to monitor
and assess the Group’s Pillar Two capital adequacy with the related fixing of the Trigger,
ToleranceandCapacitythresholds.
Among the Strategic indicators there is, for example, the capital buffer indicator in the Pillar
II context defined as the difference between the amount of own Available Financial
Resources(AFRs)andthetotaleconomiccapital.
In addition, in the same context of Pillar II capital adequacy, the Group has decided to
adopt a definition of its Available Financial Resources (AFRs) broader than Own Funds,
considering also some components that have the immediate availability feature, despite
the fact that current legislation does not allow full computability or imposes the deduction
fromOwnFunds.
This amount must not be limited merely to covering total risk capital, but must also be able
to:
95
- expand for growth beyond what is defined in the strategic plan, ensuring potential
flexibleoperationalmargins;
- manage business continuity should cumulative losses recorded over the twelve
monthsexceedthoseestimatedaccordingtotheassumedconfidencelevel;
- handle situations where market developments could be substantially worse than
forecastandincorporatedintheriskestimatemodels;
- maintain an additional capital buffer, for the purpose of maintaining/improving the
levelofcapitalization,withaviewtoimprovingratingagencyjudgements;
- pursuethetargetratioobjectivesestablishedbytheTopManagement.
Internal capital adequacy of Pillar 2 is also assessed (ordinary and stressed conditions) in
order to identify any imbalance between the evolution of risk which may be prudently
forecast based on the objectives defined during strategic and budget planning, and the
internal generation of capital through self-financing and the specific management of this
process.
To guarantee this continuous monitoring, Banco BPM Group has adopted an advanced
system for risk integration and quantification of available capital resources, with advanced
functions of management, control, reporting and simulation of capital adequacy
conditions.
The economic capital or total internal capital (total risks) thus determined is also assessed
including the outcome of stress tests. Specifically, the combined impacts on various risk
factorsofmacroeconomicscenarios,characterisedbystressconditions,areconsidered.
The Risk Unit measures and, as a result, assesses Pillar II capital adequacy on a monthly basis
andsendsspecificreportinginthisregardtotheGovernanceBodies.
This monitoring makes it possible to verify compliance with the thresholds defined within the
GroupRiskAppetiteFramework.

Credit Risk - General information regarding all banks
Definition of "past due" and "impaired" loans and methods used to determine
writedowns
Definitions of "past due" and "impaired" loans used for accounting purposes
Impaired Banco BPM Group exposures are classified into the following categories, in line
withthatestablishedundertheprudentialsupervisoryregulations:
- impaired past due and/or exceeded credit lines: these are exposures which at the
reference date have amounts past due or exceeding credit lines by more than 90 days.
This category includes positions for which the amount past due and/or exceeding the
credit line exceeds the relevance threshold of 5% of the total exposure, on the basis of
the rules found in the regulatory instructions governing in detail the technical methods
usedforcalculation;
- unlikely to pay: these are exposures which the Bank holds it unlikely that the debtor will
fully fulfil their obligations (capital and/or interest) without the use of actions such as
enforcementofguarantees;
- default: these are exposures regarding loans to customers who are insolvent, even if not
legally ascertained, relative to which targeted collection actions are carried out, total
orpartial(forcapitalandinterest).
Description of methods adopted to determine writedowns
Exposures classified as "performing"
The Banco BPM Group adopts an incurred loss metric to calculated collective writedowns
(in line with the IASB international standards), based on Basel 2 risk factors (PD and LGD), a
cyclicalfactorwiththeobjectiveofexpressingaspecificcreditstandingassessmentableto
reflect current market conditions and a corrective factor (loss confirmation period) used to
"transform" the managerial concept of expected loss into the accounting concept of losses
incurredbutnotreported.
For more information, please see that found in the section "Credit Risk: disclosure on
portfoliostowhichIRBapproachesareapplied".
Exposures classified as "past due" and "impaired"
The method used by the Banco BPM Group to estimate expected losses on impaired loans
identifies the specific risk for a given position on the basis of the amount of the exposure,
technical macroforms, type of customer and type of guarantees supporting the
transaction. This makes use of the Expected Loss Best Estimate LGD, applied in a lump sum
manner to all past due and/or over established credit line positions and to probable default
or default exposures under an established threshold. Probable default or defaulted positions
exceedingthepre-establishedlimitsaremeasuredanalyticallybythemanagers.

The process for assessing the issuer's creditworthiness requires linking the identification
information provided by external providers to all counterparties for which it is available,
irrespective of the presence and type of business present in the banking book (for example
exposuresinbankingbooksecurities,mortgageloans,etc.).
The process for assessing the creditworthiness of an issue provided by external providers
requires that it be historicised in specific systems, irrespective of the nature of the security.
This information is subsequently used for reports by linking the information using an internal
identificationcode.
With reference to the association of the external rating of each ECAI or export credit
agency chosen to the creditworthiness classes, the mapping used is provided by

Credit Risk - IRB approach
Authorisation by the Supervisory Authority and scope of application
The former Banco Popolare Group obtained authorisation from the Bank of Italy to use
internal models (original validation on 18 May 2012) according to the A-IRB (Advanced
Internal Rating Based model) approach for the purpose of calculating the capital
requirement on credit risk. Following the merger operation between the former Banco
Popolare Group and the former BPM Group, the European Supervisory Authority agreed to
theuseofinternalmodelsatthetimevalidatedontheformerBancoPopolareperimeteron
the same basis of the new Banco BPM Group for the purpose of calculating the capital
requirementsuntil31-12-2017.
Following the acceptance of the model change application made by the former Banco
Popolare in May 2015, the ECB authorised the Group to make the model changes
requested incorporating a series of temporary prudential measures into the calculation of
non-performing RWAs, of non-performing expected losses and on the retail EAD. These
measures would haveexpired afterauthorisationto usethe new A-IRB modelsfor retail EAD,
LGD defaulted assets and ELBE. Starting from the reporting of 31-03-2017, and for the whole
of2017,thefollowingprudentialmeasures(add-ons)werethereforemadeoperational:
 applicationofacreditconversionfactorof100%forIRBRetailexposures:
 calculationofnon-performingIRBRWAthroughapplicationofaregulatoryformula
 obligation of a floor for non-performing expected loss corresponding to 45% of gross
exposures.
In this context, it must be specified that, in May 2017, an application for model change and
authorisation to extend the A-IRB models to the combined Banco BPM portfolio was sent to
theECB,whichincludedthenewEADretail,LGDdefaultedassetsandELBEmodels.
Following the ECB inspection process, on 16-02-2018, the Group received authorisation to
adopt its internal risk management systems with extension to BPM S.p.A. The authorisation is
effectivestartingfromthereportingof31March2018.
The validation perimeter at 31-12-2018 consists of the assets attributable to the regulatory
classes “loan exposures to businesses” and “loan exposures to retail” (acceptance and
monitoring models) of the companies of the former Banco Popolare Group, widened to the
perimeterofBPMS.p.A,startingfromthereportingof31-03-2018.
More specifically, authorisation was requested and obtained for the use of five rating
models, aimed at estimating D (default probability) respectively of the counterparties
segmented with the Large Corporate, Mid Corporate Plus, Mid Corporate, Small Business
and Private rating models and of two LGD (Loss Given Default ELBE and Defaulted Asset)
models, aimed at estimating the loss in the case of default respectively of Business and
PrivatecounterpartiesandtheEADmodelrelativesolelytotheRetailportfolio.

Illustration of the structure, use, management processes and control
mechanisms of the internal rating systems
Structure of the internal rating systems (PD)
The rating models involved in the validation are intended to respond to a precise rationale,
thatofobtaining,forbothreportingandmanagementpurposes,riskmeasures:
 capable of incorporating the fundamental drivers underlying creditworthiness of
partiesinrelationtowhichtheGrouphasorintendstoassumeloanexposures;
 relatively stable over time, so as to reflect, in each customer segment, the long-term
expectedriskinessoftheGroup’scurrentandpotentialloanexposures;
 capable of preventing phenomena of uncontrolled growth of risk in positive cycle
periods and, on the contrary, of indiscriminate restriction of loans in those of
117
negativecycle(counter-cyclicity).
In light of these objectives, advanced statistical techniques were used in the various stages
of the estimation process (e.g. Identification of the explanatory/predictive variables of
default,integrationofthescores,etc.)aswellascalibrationoftheinternalratings.
The rating models were developed internally under the responsibility of the Risk Models
structure.
The various stages of development of the models were structured to provide for the active
involvement—in order to facilitate consistency of the models with management practices—
of all internal stakeholders, namely the Loans Unit, the Organisation Unit, the Retail and
Corporate Commercial Units, the Administration and Financial Statements Unit and the
Group'sServiceManagement(IT)Company(hereinafterInformationTechnology).
In the process of developing the models, statistical techniques were used to support the
methodological choices with solid empirical evidence. In particular, the interpretability and
economic-financial value of the indicators used in the context of the rating models were
the subject of verification by the Risks Unit during the estimation activity (i.e. economic as
well as statistical significance of the indicators) and discussions in the context of the
planningWorkgroup(i.e.Loans,InternalValidation,InternalAuditUnits).
The statistical significance of the information was ascertained through appropriate
analyses, which led to successive selections of the most significant indicators. This approach
enabled the identification of the most significant information, avoiding the inclusion of
redundant or superfluous information which would have increased its complexity, with no
effectiveaddedvalueintermsofaccuracyoftheestimatesproduced.
The set of information used to estimate the rating models was defined with the objective of
making the best use of the whole available database and was developed on the basis of
the experience gained on the rating models previously estimated and of consistency with
loan management practices, verified through the active collaboration of the competent
corporateunits.
In particular, the historical series used in the estimation stage feature the greatest time
depth available, and the development samples were selected to ensure the highest
representativenesswithrespecttotheGroup’sloanportfolio.
Structure of the internal rating systems (LGD)
The internal models for calculating Loss Given Default (LGD) were developed with the
objective of prioritising—in identifying the explanatory drivers of the estimates—consistency
withtheGroup’slendingprocesses.
The existing models at 31-12-2018 are differentiated by exposure bands, type of technical
macro-form, presence/absence of guarantee, administrative status of the counterparty
(performing,pastdue,probabledefaultsandbad)andvintagefordefaults.
These were estimated by analysing the losses suffered by the Group on historic defaults (
LGD workout), with a definition of default consistent with that applied to PD estimation
models.
118
In order to include the impacts deriving from recessive short-term periods in the LGD
calculation structure, the downturn component is estimated on the basis of the type of
portfoliobeinganalysed.
Additionally, the model includes the estimate of indirect costs, that is administrative costs
whicharenotdirectlyattributabletothesingleprocedure.
The new LGD defaulted asset models also make it possible, through a bootstrapping
approach with opportune identification of an extreme percentile of the distribution of the
LGD averages, to identify unexpected values of losses (or LGD DA), the difference of which
from the best estimate of LGD (or LGD ELBE) makes it possible to calculate (by using a
specificregulatoryformula)theRiskWeightedAssetsondefaults.
The Banco BPM Group updated the historical series underlying the estimate of the risk
parameter in question in order to incorporate the most recent evolutions of the economic
cycle.
Use of the rating system for management purposes
The main characteristics of the rating system used in the process of granting, monitoring
and managing loans, in pricing, in corporate governance and in reporting are described
brieflybelow.
Granting Loans
The rating plays a central role in assessing creditworthiness at the time of granting and
revising/modifyingcredit.
Theratingisused:
 forthepurposeofidentifyingthedecision-makingpowers,forwhich:
 the assessment of creditworthiness—expressed by the rating determined by
the models developed for the various regulatory segments of customers—is
attributedoperationallyto“Classesofdecision-makingcompetence”;
 the riskiness of the operations is measured using mitigation classes defined
basedontheLGDassociatedwitheachcreditline;
 at the moment of closing the proposal and the related decision, when the
proponent and the decision maker must express an opinion on the overall
consistency between the fiduciary arrangement being proposed/decided on (type
of credit lines and ancillary guarantees) and the assessment of creditworthiness
expressedbytherating.
The Parent Company’s Credit Unit defines the credit policy guidelines, taking into account
the economic and geo-sectoral information acquired from external sources in relation to
thedefaultprobabilityandtheexpectedlossesofthevariouseconomicsectors.
The distribution of the growth of lending volumes is divided into the various sectors based on
the values of the above metrics, providing for power reservations for counterparties with
higherratinglevels.
119
Loan Monitoring and Management
Positions that show the first symptoms of negativity are automatically placed in a monitoring
and management process. These positions are identified automatically once a month
basedonaseriesofindicators,includingtherating.
The positions of each segment that present the worst ratings classes are intercepted and
placed into the process. In addition, for each position included in the process, the Manager
must analyse the consistency of the rating with the management class proposed and
assess,casebycase,anyneedtoactivatetheprocesstochange(override)therating.
Pricing
The Group has a pricing determination corrected for credit risk; this tool is capable of
quantifying the minimum spread with respect to the internal rate of transfer of the funds
which the company must carry out to ensure coverage of the expected loss, of the cost of
capitalandofallthecomponentswhichenablevaluegeneration.
Corporate governance
The system of internal models is used as input to the portfolio model for the estimate of
economic capital against the credit risk of performing exposures, in the context of updating
the risk propensity and of monitoring the risk limits (using Second Pillar economic capital
metrics),bothonafinal-figurebasisandonaprospectivebasis.
Reporting
The rating and the LGD are the foundation of the management and operational reporting
on the risks of the loan portfolio. As regards the management reporting, the Risks Unit
periodically prepares the Tableau de Board of the Risks, which provides an overview of the
Group’s risk position with reference to the set of all risk factors, according to an
arrangementcompliantwithBasel3(PillarIandPillarII).
Calculation of collective impairment losses on performing positions
For calculating the collective impairment losses, the Banco BPM Group, starting from 01-01-
2018, adopts, , the new accounting standard IFRS 96. The main innovation introduced
consists of calculating lifetime expected losses for all positions which, with respect to the
origination date (that is the date on which the account was opened), have presented a
SICR—significant increase in credit risk. The assessment of the SICR of a position is based on
quantitative criteria which use the lifetime default probabilities. To detect any worsening of
creditworthiness which is not detected by the application of a statistical model, the
assessment is then supplemented by qualitative risk indicators. This means that, for these
positions, it is necessary to estimate the expected losses which can occur for the duration of
the relationship until expiry (and not only for the first year of life, as required by the previous
accounting standard IAS 39). In turn, this need requires the development of new models

the new accounting standard that deals with the stages of recognition and measurement of financial assets and
calculationofprovisions.
120
which, starting from the internal models already implemented by the Bank (in accordance
with Basel 3), make it possible to estimate in a forward-looking manner all the credit risk
parameterswhichcombineinthemeasurementoftheexpectedlosses.
In particular, Banco BPM estimates the lifetime expected losses using a combination of the
followingparameters:
 DefaultProbability(PD);
 LossGivenDefault(LGD);
 ExposureatDefault(EAD).
In order to observe the new accounting standard for calculation of expected losses, the
parametersofPD,LGDandEADmustbe:
 Point in Time: the models used must reflect the macroeconomic conditions in being
atthereportingdate;
 Forward-looking: the risk parameters must, where possible, incorporate the available
futuremacroeconomicinformation;
 Lifetime: to be able to measure the expected losses of positions which have suffered
a significant increase in credit risk with respect to origination, it is necessary estimate
theparametersfortheentirelifeofaninstrument.
In general, the estimate of the lifetime expected losses can be summarised by the following
formula:
where:
 Trepresentstheexpirydateoftheoperation;
 representsthediscountfactor(e.g.effectiveinterestrate[EIR]);
 represents the effective exposure at time t, calculated as the sum of the future
cashflowsdiscountedattheinterestrate;
 represents the marginal default probability between tempo t e t+1 calculated as
the difference between the accumulated PD at time t+1 and the accumulated PD
attimet;
 representsthelossgivendefaulttobeappliedattheinstantt.
Calculation of the impairment loss with statistical procedure on positions in
default (ELBE)
Forthepurposeofaccountingmeasurementofimpairedloanportfoliossubjecttostatistical

appropriately modified with respect to its prudential version—for the accounting

Process of management and recognition of the techniques for attenuating
credit risks
TheBancoBPMGrouppaysattentiontotheacquisitionofloancollateralsandsecurities,i.e.
the use of tools and techniques that facilitate the mitigation of credit risk. On this point, in
the performance of lending activities by the Group Banks, the acquisition of the guarantees
typical of the banking business is widespread; these are, mainly, real guarantees on
properties or financial instruments and personal sureties given by private individuals,
businesses,financialinstitutions,etc.
Within the Basel Project, and in particular in the CRM project area—which saw the
transversal contribution of resources of the Risks, Organisation and Information Systems
units—all the actions of a methodological, organisational and procedural kind were carried
out in order to enable the use of risk mitigation techniques based on internal default
probability (PD) and loss given default (LGD) models, in line with the legislative
requirements.
With particular reference to management of the various types of real and personal
122
guarantees,thereare:
 IT procedures that cover all the aspects related to management of the
aforementionedguarantees;
 Internal rules (Circulars, Instructions, Regulations, Process Standards) for the use of all
the Organisational Structures involved (Network and Central Structures), which
provideindicationsofbothanormativeandatechnical-operationalnature.
The compliance of these actions with the legislative requirements was subjected to
verificationbytheinternalvalidationandauditunits.
Control and revision of the rating systems
A prerequisite for the adoption of internal risk measurement systems for calculating the
capital requirement is the presence of a process of validation and internal auditing of the
rating systems, both at the stage of setting up these systems, aimed at obtaining
authorisation from the Supervisory Authorities, and at the stage of continual
management/maintenanceofthesameonceauthorisationhasbeenobtained.
The Banco BPM Group has an internal Validation unit (part of the staff of the Risks unit)
responsible for the validation processes of the Banco BPM Group’s risk measurement and
management systems. These activities are carried out independently by the Units tasked
withriskmeasurementandmanagementandbytheUnitresponsibleforInternalAuditing.
The structure is responsible for continual and iterative validation activity related to the risk
measurement and management systems, in order to assess their adequacy with respect to
the legislative requirements, the corporate operating needs and those of the market of
reference.
The Internal Audit activity provided for in the Supervisory Regulations is carried out by Banco
BPM’s Audit unit. With specific regard to credit risks, the structure audits the entire process of
adoption and management of the internal measurement systems according to methods
and areas of responsibility defined by the corporate regulations and on the basis of a
specificworkplan.
The structure is tasked with assessing the functionality of the overall arrangement of the
process of measuring, managing and controlling the Group’s exposure to credit risks, also
through periodic audits of the process of internal validation of the related models prepared
underthetermsofthePrudentialSupervisoryregulations.
Description of the internal rating models for the regulatory Corporate and Private
segments (valid at 31-12-2018)
Aspects common to the various models
Calibration of the model is based on a long-term central tendency. The calibration function
was created to define a correspondence between integrated scores and the long-term
defaultprobabilities(PDs).
123
The calibration philosophy adopted by the former Banco is based on a logic of a through-
the-cycle (TTC) type, which neutralises the possible impacts deriving from the presence of
aneconomiccycleinthestageofexpansionorrecession.
The PD models return valuations divided into 11 performing rating classes, with average
classPDsdifferentiatedforeachratingmodel.
Additionally, the Group has defined a methodological approach, on the basis of which the
counterparty’s rating undergoes notching to consider whether the counterparty belongs to
an Economic Group (only legal links between parent company and subsidiary are
considered).
Large Corporate model
The Large Corporate rating model was defined taking into account the classification of
customers provided by the Credit Department experts (expert rank ordering). The objective
of this decision was to obtain an assessment of the counterparty, which on the one hand
would be based on statistical principles, and on the other would incorporate the specialist
experienceoftheCreditUnitonthiscustomersegment.
Thismodelismadeupoftwomodules:economic-financialandqualitative.
The score obtained from the qualitative module intervenes by notching (positive, negative
orneutral)theratingclassderivingfromtheeconomic-financialscore.
The counterparty's rating can subsequently be changed for companies belonging to an
economicgroup.
Finally, the Rating Desk and Performance structure attributes the final rating through a
review of the rating assigned by the model based on warning signals or other information
relatedtoperformance,availablebutnotcaptureddirectlybythemodel.
Business Models
The models related to Small Business, Mid Corporate and Mid Corporate Plus segmented
counterparties are developed starting from four information sources processed in specific
modules that contribute, through statistical scores, to determining the final Default
Probability(PD) for each individual counterparty, through the adoption of integration
functions differentiated by segment and by seniority of customers (acceptance portfolio
andmonitoringportfolio).
The elementary modules on which these models are based, corresponding to the four
informationsources,arethefollowing:
 Internal Performance module: the purpose of this is to detect the trend of
creditworthiness of trusted counterparties over time, and it is based on data
concerningrelationsofthesaidcounterpartieswiththebanksintheGroup;
 Central Credit Register module: the purpose of this is to detect the evolution over
time of the counterparty's relationship (if reported) with the other banks of the
system,basedonthereportingdataoftheCentralCreditRegister;
124
 Economic-Financial module: the purpose of this is to assess the creditworthiness of
customers based on economic-financial information, with particular reference to
counterparties that prepare financial statements according to the provisions of the
CivilCode(orordinaryaccounting);
 Qualitative module: this is based on information coming from qualitative
questionnaires,dividedintothecounterparties'businessactivitysegments.
Starting from the single scores of the modules, an integrated score is statistically
calculated(integration function) to summarise in a single risk indicator the results coming
from the elementary modules (Internal Performance, Central Credit Register and Economic-
Financial for the monitoring model; Central Credit Register, Economic-Financial and
Qualitativefortheacceptancemodel).
The score produced by the integration function is subsequently associated with a default
probability (PD) through the definition and application of a specific calibration function; this
probability of default is, finally, mapped on the rating classes. The calibration functions,
differentiated for each rating segment, have the objective of anchoring the Default
Probabilitiestothelong-termCentralTendency.
In addition, after the calibration stage, the qualitative questionnaire on the monitoring
model intervenes to notch the rating class, starting from specific intervals (cut-offs) of the
qualitative scores (more specifically, each interval corresponds to a certain number of plus
orminusnotchesontheratingclass).
Finally, in the case of a Large Corporate, Mid Corporate Plus, Mid Corporate or Small
Business segmented counterparty belonging to a Group or with a consolidating Parent
Company which is Large Corporate or Mid Corporate Plus (with consolidated financial
statements), the rules on notching (upgrading/downgrading of the counterparty’s rating)
definedbytheGroupareapplied.
Private Customer Model
The default probability is calculated and attributed by counterparty. For customers shared
with several banks in the Group, the principle of data accumulation is adopted in order to
calculateasingleratingforthesecounterparties.
The development sample is made up of all Private counterparties, that is counterparties
whose legal nature is “Natural Persons or Joint Accounts of natural persons”, with an
exposure recorded in relation to the Group banks, with no connection to a sole trader, or
jointaccountsofnaturalpersons.
Each module is based on a different information source and provides an intermediate
score, which contributes to the various integration functions that assign the final PD to the
counterparty.
Themodelis madeup offourelementary modules whichcontributeto determiningthe final
counterparty PD through four integration functions, divided by seniority of relationship
betweencustomerandbankandbypresence/absenceofanewproduct.
125
Description of the Business and Private LGD models
These models are differentiated by exposure bands, type of technical macro-form,
presence/absence of guarantee and status of the counterparty (performing, past due,
probable defaults and bad). These were estimated by analysing the losses suffered by the
Group on historic defaults ( LGD workout), with a definition of default consistent with that
appliedtoPDestimationmodels.
Conditionally upon entry into default status, some cases of resolution of their cycle may be
associated with each counterparty, irrespective of the progress made in the intermediate
stagesofdefault.Thesecasesmaybe:
 return to performing: or the case of a counterparty in default that returns to being
part of the performing portfolio. This can happen both if the bank suffers no loss and
ifitdoes;
 closure of the position: when a counterparty in default does not become Bad and
closes the commercial relationships with the bank during the status of Past Due or
ProbableDefault.Thiscanhappenbothifthebanksuffersnolossandifitdoes;
 transfer to bad: the most serious status of default, from which it is not possible to
return neither to a previous default status nor to performing. When a counterparty is
transferred to Bad, all relationships with the Bank are closed, and the process begins
ofrecoveringtheamountforwhichthecounterpartyisexposed.
All the possible routes that a counterparty in default may follow, and which were
consideredintheLGDmodels,areshowninthefigurebelow:
126
The default statuses related to Past Due and Probable Default can occur as initial entry
statuses or, only in cases of Probable Default, also later. A further possibility for resolution of
the default is finally activation of the Revocatory procedure (or action), which can occur
aftertransfertoDefaultstatusfollowingaClosureorReturntoPerforming.
The LGD models consist of five versions, according to the administrative status of the
counterparty.
In order to include the impacts deriving from recessive short-term periods in the LGD
calculation structure, the downturn component is estimated on the basis of the type of
portfolio being analysed. The addition of this effect to the LGD estimate is determined
through the application of a specific correction factor (add-on). This approach consists of
estimating the main components of the model in downturn periods identified along the
historical series taken as a reference and verifying the impact with respect to the result
obtainedfromtheLGDestimateperformedontheentireobservationperiod.
The models also include the estimate of the indirect costs (administrative costs that are not
directly attributable to the individual file), which is accessed through the following steps:
identification of the average cost per year for a bad file, allocation—on the basis and
duration of the file in default—of the annual average cost and, finally, prudential allocation
ofthesameamountalsoforpre-badstatuses.
In addition, to comply with the legislative requirements on the subject the new LGD
defaulted asset models it possible, through a bootstrapping approach with opportune
identification of an extreme percentile of the distribution of the LGD averages, to identify
unexpected values of losses (so-called LGD DA) the difference of which from the best
estimate of LGD (the LGD ELBE) makes it possible to calculate (through the use of a specific
regulatoryformula)theRiskWeightedAssetsondefaults.

Overall, we can note an increase in the PD of the performing portfolio compared to the figure
recorded in December 2017 as well as a lower LGD. Note that the comparison between the
two dates is not homogeneous given that, following validation in February 2018, the perimeter
subject to the AIRB approach includes former BPM Spa exposures in the December 2018
figures. Additionally, both the PD and LGD risk parameters were re-estimated after an update
tothedefinitionofdefault.

Comparison between estimates and effective results
The Banco BPM uses internal PD, LGD and EAD estimates for the purposes of calculating
capitalrequirementsrelativetocreditrisk.
The comparison between estimates and empirical data is done for all risk parameters
throughbacktestingperformedbytheInternalValidationfunction.
With reference to the PD models, the Banco BPM Group adopts performance
measurements to check the accuracy ratio (AR) of the estimates and calibration tests
(“classical” binomial test over an annual and multi-annual period) to compare the decay
rates(DRs)recordedoveranannualtimehorizonwiththeestimatedPDvalues.
As regards the Business segment, from the latest backtesting there emerges a good
accuracy ratio of the models at the level both of single modules and of final integrated
score, which comes out at values comparable to those obtained in the development
stage.
With regards to calibration, for all corporate models (Large Corporate, Mid Corporate Plus,
Mid Corporate and Small Business) values indicate greater prudentiality than the PD value
fortheclasswithrespecttothedecayraterecordedaredeemedsatisfactory.
134
In relation to the Private Customer segment, overall the model performed well. As regards
calibration,theresultsofthebinomialtestsweresatisfactory.
Analysis done at the time the LGD model was extended to the BPM perimeter indicated
substantial validity of the model. Verification activities involved the discriminating capacity
ofthemodel.
The most recent investigations done on the Probability of Default parameter were, for both
the Business and Private segments, in line with expectations if compared with the results
obtainedintheestimate.
Analysis done at the time of initial validation of the EAD model for the retail component
indicated substantial validity of the model. Also for this parameter, the validation framework
involvestheperformanceofstatisticaltestsinordertoverifyresistanceovertime.
In general, note that during 2018 fine tuning was done on all models, with the aim of
overcoming the areas of attention identified by the Internal Validation function during its
verificationactivities.
Comparison between PD and default (DR) data by exposure class
In this paragraph Internal Validation puts default rates into relation with estimated PDs,
dividing the IRB regulatory portfolio at the reference date of 31 December 2017. The
exposure classes are further divided by PD scale, as defined in table EU CR67. The reference
databaseisthereportingenvironment,definingregulatorydefault.
TheIRBinternalmodels,includedintheIRBregulatoryexposureclasses,are:
- Large Corporate, turnover/assets ≥ 500 mln 
- MidCorporatePlus,turnover/assetsbetween50and500mln
- MidCorporate,turnover/assetsbetween5and50mln
- SmallBusiness,turnover/assets<5mln
- PrivateCustomers
Unlike the Private Customer segment, the first four models come within the Business macro-
category.
With reference to the reporting of 31 December 2018, the division in terms of RWAs of the
internalmodelsforIRBregulatoryexposureclassesisasfollows:
InternalModels %RWAs
LargeCorporate 12.46%
MidCorporatePlus 22.85%
MidCorporate 28.02%
SmallBusiness 25.78%

Forthefigurescontainedinthetablebelow,notethat:
- startingfrom31 March2018, theBancoBPM Group obtained authorisationto putthe
new A-IRB models into production, with extension to the former BPM perimeter. The
new models also incorporate the new definition of default at 90 days, with absolute
materiality threshold of Past Due loans differentiated between Business and Private
Customers. The DRs shown were instead calculated applying the regulatory default,
obtaininginthiswaymoreconservativeresults;
- owing to the mapping to IRB of debtors coming from the former BPM during the
performance year analysed, and subsequent incorporation of BPM s.p.a. into Banco
BPMs.p.a.,itwasdecidedtoshowtheDRsonlyfortheformerBPperimeter,whilethe
“Number of debtors End of year” column takes into account also the former BPM

Risk Mitigation Techniques
Types of guarantees
Techniques used to mitigate credit risk include accessory contracts or other instruments and
techniques which the Banco BPM Group acquires in its execution of its banking business,
aimedatreducingcreditrisk.
The main types of collateral guarantees used by the Banco BPM Group can be summarised
withinthemacrocategoriesindicatedbelow:
 mortgagesonrealestateassets(residentialandcommercial);
 pledgesoncash,securitiesandmutualfundsdepositedwiththeBank;
 pledgesoninsurancepolicies;
 pledgesongoods;
 pledgesoncash/securitiesdepositedwiththirdparties;
 mortgagesonregisteredmoveableassets.
The first two types of guarantees represent the majority of collateral acquired and comply with
the technical/legal/organisational requirements indicated under the new regulatory provisions
fortheapplicationoftherulesestablishedforcreditriskmitigation.
Forbothofthesemacrocategoriesofcollateral,thereare:
 IT procedures which cover all aspects associated with management of this collateral
(acquisition,valuation,management,repayment/enforcement);
 internal norms for all involved organisational structures (network and central structures),
governing the roles and responsibilities and providing both regulatory and
technical/operationalsupportindications.
Atthetimethecollateralisacquired:
 alldocumentationrelativetothecollateraliscollected
 the individual collateral contracts and relative set of information needed for
managerial/reporting/financialreportingneedsareregisteredintherelevantapplications
 formalandsubstantialcontrolsonthecollateralacquiredareperformed
 completenessofdocumentsisascertainedandproperfilingischecked.
In particular, for mortgages, initial acquisition of the value of the real estate asset occurs at the
time the loan is disbursed, on the basis of an appraisal issued by independent technicians for
any amount of credit requested and/or the value of the asset; all the data regarding the asset
used as collateral (e.g. cadastral information, periodic reappraisals, etc.) are acquired during
the disbursement process through a specific IT procedure dedicated to cataloguing,
managingandqueryingdatarelativetorealestateusedascollateral;

In particular, for real estate collateral, specific rules for updating values using statistical
methodshavebeenestablished.
Following statistical revaluations, assets which meet conditions for updating the relative
appraisal are identified. Additionally, in compliance with the rules established in the EBA
Guidelines, periodic reviews of appraisals are also required for real estate assets exceeding
pre-establishedthresholds.
Relativetopledges,thefollowingisrequired:
 initial acquisition of the value of the pledge when the loan is disbursed, on the basis of its
market value adjusted by a prudential haircut (percentage of the value of the security
used as collateral) and differentiated based on the type and risk level of the underlying
security;
 daily update of the market value of securities pledged, including the prudential haircut
applied as afunction ofthetypeand riskiness ofthesecurity,withautomatic notificationof
actions to update the guarantee in the case its value falls below the pre-established
thresholdsforthecoverageparametersenvisaged.
Credit derivative transactions
The Banco BPM Group can carry out transactions to hedge exposures with credit derivatives,
withnationalandinternationalcounterpartiesofexcellentstanding.
With regards to its activities in derivatives with institutional counterparties and in line with best
market practices, the Banco BPM Group has ISDA agreements supported by CSAs to mitigate
counterpartyrisk.
Market and credit risk concentrations
Real estate collateral constitutes the largest part of instruments used to attenuate credit risk.
The structure of the Group's loan portfolio for the most part consists of loans to private
individuals and small and medium enterprises. This favours the limitation of concentration, also
inthecontextofriskmitigationtools.
Analysis of changes in real estate values is done periodically, in order to measure the
resistanceofthesame.

Counterparty Risk
Approach and policies
Counterparty risk is a type of credit risk, defined as the risk that the counterparty in a
transaction enters default prior to the definitive settlement of the cashflows relative to the
transaction.
The risk is bilateral (the value of the transaction may be positive or negative for both
counterparties), the development of which depends both upon changes in market
parametersandontheriskinessofthecounterparty(PDandLGD).
Policies relative to guarantees and measurements of counterparty risk depend on the type of
financial instruments traded which, in line with the regulatory scope, may fall into one of the
followingcategories:
 OvertheCounter(OTC)derivatives
 Securities Financing Transactions (SCT): these typically are associated with repurchase
agreements receivable or payable regarding securities or goods, transactions to
buy/sell/loansecuritiesorgoodsandloanswithmarginsMedium/long-termloans
 Transactions with long-term settlement: transactions with a settlement or delivery date after
that used in general market practice or with respect to five business days following the
datethetransactionisstipulatedbytheentity,ifprior
With an eye to improving risk mitigation relative to the counterparties with which it has OTC
derivative transactions, ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) can be
prepared, which respectively provide for netting and payment of reciprocal financial
guarantees.
Risk deriving from the execution of securities loan transactions and repurchase agreements is
mitigated through Global Master Securities Lending Agreements (GMSLA) and Global Master
RepurchaseAgreements(GMRA)withtheaimofestablishingasystemofguarantees.
Forward exchanges may be included under CSAs and hence subject to margining, as occurs
forOTCderivatives.
Capital requirements relative to counterparty risk relate to both positions in the trading book
andthoseinthebankingbook.
When quantifying its exposure to risk, the Banco BPM Group uses for regulatory purposes the
market value method (article 274, Regulation EU 575/2013) for OTC traded derivatives, while
for SFT type transactions (repurchase agreements and securities loans) it adopts the integral
approach, applying regulatory adjustments (articles 223 and 224, Regulation EU 575/2013) to
taketherelativevolatilityintoaccount.
The Banco BPM Group also adopts its own methods for internal use to estimate exposure of
OTC financial derivatives, on which economic capital needed to deal with the maximum loss
iscalculated.
In general, models for internal use include revaluation of the market value for future scenarios
through an historical simulation-based approach, considering correlations between risk factors
whichinfluenceprice(interestrates,exchangerates,stockprices).
The presence of any risk mitigation agreements between the parties (netting and collateral
agreements) and the type of transactions imply diversification of methods used to calculate
expected future exposure, defined as the expected value of the loss at present conditional on
thefactthatatafuturedatethecounterpartygoesintodefault.
In particular, relative to counterparties with which a collateral agreement has been signed
(Credit Support Annex – CSA) as a guarantee and to mitigate risk, the expected exposure is
measured on the basis of possible changes in the mark to market relative to the contracts
underlying the CSA in question, over a time horizon given as the characteristics "period of
marginatrisk"foreachcontract.
This measure is also implemented in the chain of credit processes for derivative positions held
with guaranteed counterparties, through the attribution of specific lines of credit, the revision
of usage values and the development of tools to support monitoring. Prudentially, corrective
factors are applied to the measured exposure, including a "wrong way risk" indicator, equal to
afixed1.2.
In the context of the contractual negotiation of the CSA, a threshold is determined, normally
setatzero,whichwhenexceededleadstotheobligationofprovidingguarantees.
The guarantees, generally provided in the form of cash, are updated based on the frequency
indicated in the contract (generally daily), either increasing or decreasing in relation to
changes in market value equal to, or exceeding, a minimum amount established in the
contractforeachcounterparty.
Exposure to counterparty risk, mitigated by the effects of contractual netting, represents
around63%oftotalexposureforOTCfinancialinstrumentstraded.
Negotiation of guarantee agreements (Credit Support Annexes) mainly occurs in the absence
of clauses with impacts on the amount of guarantees to be provided in the case the Group's
creditstandingisdowngraded.
On the basis of the valuations of contracts negotiated at 28/12/2018, this impact is irrelevant:
collateral is represented by cash (not subject to "haircuts"); for one counterparty, the
guarantee consists of government securities to which the established haircuts have already
beenapplied.
In compliance with the Basel 3 Regulatory Scheme, additional capital requirements are also
calculatedwithregardsto:
 own funds for the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA Risk) through adoption of the
standardised approach, as envisaged in Regulation (EU) 575/13 for banks not authorised to
use the IMM method for counterparty risk and the internal models method for the
IncrementalRiskCharge(IRC);
 exposuresrelativetotransactionswithqualifiedcentralcounterparties(QCCP),throughthe
adoption of the methods envisaged under articles 305, 306 and 308 of Regulation EU
575/2013.
With regards to exposures with qualified central counterparties (QCCP), Group companies are
directparticipantswithcertainsectorsoftheCassadiCompensazioneeGaranzia.
For the purposes of adapting to Regulation (EU) 648/2012 ( "EMIR") indirect adhesion to the
London Clearing House LCH is active, for OTC derivatives transactions, and with the central
counterparty ICE Clear Europe for credit derivative transactions (3 contracts acquired for a
total notional value of €125 million; specifically, 1 contract for €75 million, 2 contracts for €25
millioneach).
Reporting system
The reporting process includes a periodic managerial reporting system, with aggregate and
detailedanalysisofthemainfactorsdeterminingcounterpartyrisk.
By way of example, trend data for risk and exposure is provided, broken down by segment
(OTCderivatives,SFTtransactions)andbylegalentity.
The reporting system also includes daily monitoring of usage amounts relative to credit lines for
OTC derivative transactions supported by Credit Support Annexes, also highlighting any
overdraftswhichmayoccur.

Securitisation and Covered Bond Transactions
Summary of objectives and methods
Through the execution of securitisation and covered bond transactions the Group has pursued
the following main objectives: diversification of funding sources, reduction of the cost of
funding and possible freeing up of capital. Additionally, during 2018 the Group carried out
securitisation transactions through the block disposal of loans classified as in default within the
contextofderiskingactions.
In all Group securitisation transactions (with the exception of the default loan securitisation
transaction known as Red Sea SPV S.r.l.) the disposing bank maintained the "first loss" through
subscription of the junior securities. The senior securities were alternatively placed with
institutional investors for all transactions executed before December 2007, or entirely held by
the Originator Banks for the other transactions carried out since the 2008 crisis. Securitisations
characterised by the full subscription of the securities issued by the Special Purpose Entities
(SPE) are called “self-securitisations” and their exclusive purpose is funding, in that senior
securities are used to obtain liquidity by means of refinancing transactions with the ECB or
throughrepurchaseagreementswithmarketcounterparties.
The Group also has three Covered Bond issues ("CB") destined for institutional investors or for
repurchase by the issuer for use in retained financing transactions: a structured program issued
by the former Banco Popolare (“BP OBG1”) guaranteed by the vehicle BP Covered Bond S.r.l.
and two programs issued by the former BPM S.c.ar.l. (“BPM OBG1” and “BPM OBG2”)
guaranteed respectively by the vehicles BPM Covered Bond S.r.l. and BPM Covered Bond 2
S.r.l. In all the programmes cited above, Banco BPM acts as the issuer bank for the CBs, as the
bank selling the assets (pursuant to article 7-bis of Law 130 of 30 April 1999( and as the lending
bank. The securities issued are placed with institutional investors or subscribed by Banco BPM
which uses them for refinancing transactions with the European Central Bank or other
institutionalcounterparties.
As at 31 December 2018, the Banco BPM Group had carried out the following securitisation
transactions:
 BP Mortgages S.r.l. (March 2007): securitisation of performing residential mortgages
originatedbyBancaPopolarediVerona–SGSPS.p.A.,nowBancoBPM;
 BP Mortgages S.r.l. (June 2007): securitisation of performing residential mortgages
originated by Banca Popolare di Novara S.p.A. and by Credito Bergamasco S.p.A., now
BancoBPM;
 BPL Mortgages S.r.l. Series V (December 2012-self-securitisation): securitisation of performing
residential mortgages originating with Banco Popolare Soc. Coop. and Credito
BergamascoS.p.A.andfromBancaPopolarediMilanoS.p.A.nowBancoBPM;
 BPL Mortgages S.r.l. Series VII (June 2014-self-securitisation): securitisation of performing
landed-property loans and mortgages and of loans secured by other collateral and
personal guarantees disbursed to SMEs by Banco Popolare and by Credito Bergamasco
S.p.A.,andfromBancaPopolarediMilanoS.p.A.,nowBancoBPM;
 Italfinance Securitization Vehicle S.r.l. (December 2005): securitisation of performing leases
originatedbyBancaItaleaseS.p.A.,nowBancoBPM;
 Italfinance Securitization Vehicle 2 S.r.l. (January 2009 - self-securitisation): securitisation of
performingleasesoriginatedbyBancaItaleaseS.p.A.,nowBancoBPM;
 BPM Securitisation 2 S.r.l. (July 2006): securitisation of residential mortgages originated by
BancaPopolarediMilanoS.c.a.r.l.,nowBancoBPM;
 ProFamily Securitisation S.r.l. (November 2015 - self-securitisation) securitisation of a portfolio
ofperformingconsumerloansoriginatedbyProFamilyS.p.A.
The loans underlying these transactions have not been derecognised from the financial
statementsoftheoriginatorbank,butcontinuetoberecordedamong“Loanstocustomers”.
Belowarenewtransactionscompletedduringtheyear,inthecontextofderiskingprojects:
 Red Sea SPV S.r.l (Exodus Project) - subject to full derecognition from the financial
statements: in June Banco BPM completed the disposal of a portfolio of default loans for a
gross nominal value of around 5.1 billion to the vehicle Red Sea SPV S.r.l., through a
securitisation transaction within which the senior securities issued as part of the transaction
are backed by government guarantees pursuant to Decree Law 18/2016 (GACS), issued
by the Ministry of Economy and Finance on 5 September 2018. Banco BPM subscribed the
seniorsecuritiesandholds5%ofthejuniorandmezzaninesecurities.
 Leviticus SPV S.r.l (Ace Project) – warehousing: on 28 December 2018, the transfer to
Leviticus SPV S.r.l. (a vehicle specifically established and not part of the Banco BPM Group)
of a portfolio of default loans for a gross value of around 6 billion and of around 1.1 billion
net of writeoffs was completed. The nominal value before writeoffs was 7.4 billion, relative
to the date of enjoyment established contractually, 30 June 2018. Considering that at 31
December 2018 the cited vehicle had not yet issued the securities, the transaction is
classified as in warehousing for the purposes of the financial statements. On 6 February
2019 the transaction was completed through the issuing of securities entirely subscribed by
BancoBPMbythevehicle;inthecontextofthesignedagreements,presumably95%ofthe
junior and mezzanine securities issued by the vehicle will be sold. This involves significant
transfer of the risks and benefits associated with the portfolio of loans transferred, and
consequentaccountingderecognition.
The main risks inherent to securitisation transactions, with the exception of those subject to full
derecognition, and those of the CBs can be summarised as: (i) interest rate risk, linked to
possible fixed-rate/floating-rate tranches/series on an underlying portfolio of mortgages with
different types of rates; (ii) credit risk, attributable to the quality of the loans transferred to the
special-purpose entity and, therefore, to their performance; (iii) counterparty risk, consisting in
the possibility that the creditworthiness of third party counterparties involved in transactions
(swap counterparties, cash managers, account banks etc.) could deteriorate to such an
extent as to create a liquidity problem with a consequent negative impact on the ratings of
individual tranches/series issued; (iv) reputational risk, consisting of the possibility that a specific
event negatively influences the credibility and the image of the group on the reference
market (failure to observe the regulatory tests envisaged in the CB programmes, delay in the
reporting sent out for external purposes); also the lack of actions by Banco BPM so as to
support the operations if it is envisaged that they may negatively influence the Group’s
credibility on the market; (v) liquidity risk, linked to the performance of the collateral book: a
deterioration in the portfolio securitised or transferred as part of a CB programme may create
a shortfall in the transaction’s financial structure and, as a result, the inability of the vehicle to
reimburse the securities issued or to pay the interest on the securities in the case of default by
the issuer (for CBs), or cause the failure of the regulatory or contractual tests envisaged in the
CBprogrammes.
There is an additional type of risk in the self-securitisations structured by the Group, and the
series of CBs repurchased by the Originator and used in monetary policy transactions with the
ECB, also linked to the quality of the underlying portfolio. A deterioration in the transferred
loans could result in a reduction in the price of the senior tranche by the supervisory authorities
in refinancing transactions, as well as a reduction in the rating of the securities also below the
minimum threshold for ECB eligibility, with a resulting impact on the value of the portfolio of
securitieswhichcanbelodgedandareeligibleand,therefore,onthebank’sliquidity.
In the securitisation transactions carried out (with the exception of those relative to derisking
projects), Banco BPM serves as the originator and servicer of the portfolios sold and sometimes
as the subordinated lender. he role of Originator involves the transfer of loan books to SPE
incorporated under the form of “società per la cartolarizzazione di crediti” (loan securitisation
companies) pursuant to Italian Law 130/1999, which finance the purchase of books through
theissueofABSsecurities.
Furthermore, Banco BPM performs certain specific activities within the securitisation
transactions, including the role of “Administrative Servicer”, meaning the party in charge of
performing certain accounting and administration services on behalf of the SPE, and, as
InterimAccountBank(custodianbankoftheSPE’saccounts)withtheobligationoftransferring
thefundscreditedtocurrentaccountsheldbytheSPEtotheAccountBank.
In securitisation transactions, BPL Mortgages S.r.l. Series V and BPL Mortgages VII and with
regard to the two CB programmes (BP OBG1 and BPM OBG1), Banco BPM also acts as
CustodianBank,holdingseveralaccountsinthenamesoftherelativeSPEs.
The Banco BPM Group has arranged a set of periodic assessments to monitor the changes in
risks relating to the securitisations and CB programmes. In the area of securitisation
transactions, the following are periodically monitored: (i) the performance of the portfolio in
terms of levels of default, delinquency and prepayment, and (ii) the levels of ratings of senior
andmezzaninetranches.
In the area of Covered Bonds, in addition to periodically monitoring the performance of the
portfolio in terms of levels of default, delinquency and prepayment, regulatory tests are
conducted as well as those required by the rating agencies, at a greater frequency than set
forth in the Programme’s contractual documentation, in order to promptly act to support the
transaction,thusavoidingfailureofthetestsandtherelatedconsequences.
For risks relating to securitisations and Covered Bond programmes, Banco BPM has adopted a
series of useful mitigation mechanisms. Specifically, to mitigate counterparty risk in the
transactions, counterparties with high ratings are involved, and contractual provisions are
entered which state that in the event of downgrading of said counterparties, certain
guarantees may be given or they may be replaced. Reputational risk, instead, is mitigated by
meansofeffectiverelationswiththemarketandwithinstitutionalinvestors.
The selection of a high quality loan book, as well as the monitoring and management of
transferred loans, along with the level of credit enhancement/overcollaterisation significantly
reduceliquidityrisk.
Lastly, with regard to interest rate risk, recourse to the signing of derivative contracts, if
necessary, protects the SPE from unexpected movements in the interest rate curve, shielding it
frominterestraterisk.
To calculate risk-weighted exposures for securitisation risks, the Banco BPM Group applies two
differentapproaches,orderedhierarchically:
 if the loan exposures included in the securitised book are subject to the application of
the standardised approach, the same approach is likewise applied to the exposure
towardsthesecuritisation;
 if the loan exposures included in the securitised book are subject to the application of
the advanced approaches based on internal models, the same approach is likewise
appliedtotheexposuretowardsthesecuritisation.
ThesecuritiesissuedaspartofasecuritisationtransactionoraCBprogrammemaybe:
(i) placed on the market through parties assigned for such purposes in advance
(dealers/leadmanagers,bookrunners,etc.);or
(ii) fully subscribed by the originator of the transferred assets or by the issuer in the case of

counterpartiesorinmonetarypolicytransactionswiththeEurosystem.
Summary of accounting policies
In securitisation transactions, the transfer of financial assets to an SPE, even without recourse,
involves the derecognition of such assets only if there is a substantial transfer of risks and
rewards.
For securitisations originated by the Group, no derecognition of the loans from the financial
statements was carried out when the transaction was executed, even if transferred. This is
because the Group has maintained the credit risk associated with the securitised portfolio and
the relative rewards, by subscribing the tranche of junior securities, or the securities that bear
theriskoftheinitiallosses,ortheassumptionofsimilarexposures.
As a result, the loans continue to be recognised in the originator bank’s separate financial
statements as “Assets disposed of and not derecognised”; the consideration received from
the transfer is recognised as a balancing entry to the recognition of a payable to the SPE, net
ofthesecuritiessubscribedbythebank.
In the consolidated financial statements, the primary effect of the consolidation of the SPE
and the relative securitisation assets, if the control requirements established by IFRS 10 are
respected, is that the securities issued by the SPE and subscribed by entities not belonging to
theGroupareincludedinthestatementoffinancialposition.
Thefollowingareexceptionstotheabovegeneralrule:
 the Tiepolo securitisation which nonetheless saw an attempt at closure during the year
through (i) the repurchase of the entire residual portfolio at 21 May 2018 and (ii) the
derecognition of class C securities still in circulation after the conclusion of the
extraordinarypaymentdateon25June2018;
 the securitisations performed by the former Italease Group, relative to which the
agreements entered into on 24 December 2009 between Banca Italease and Alba
Leasing, at the time of the former Banco Popolare Group’s acquisition of control of
Banca Italease and the relative reorganisation of leasing activities, resulted in the full
derecognition of loans originated by the banking channel, the risks and rewards of
whichareborneinfullbyAlbaLeasing;

derecognitioninthefinancialstatements.

Market risk - IMA approach
Characteristics of the internal models and description of the stress tests applied
Internal model Banco BPM, Banca Akros
At the beginning of 2012, the Banco BPM Group obtained validation of the internal model for
market risks, with effect from 30.06.2012. The internal model is used in association with
management risk measures that differ from regulatory measures by virtue of the risk factors
consideredandsometechnicalelements.
The main characteristics of the VaR internal model used to value market risk from a regulatory
andmanagementperspectivearesetforthbelow:
 Method:historicalsimulation
 Timehorizon:1day(re-parameterisedto10daysforregulatorypurposes)
 Depthofhistoricalseries:1year
 Confidencelevel:99%
 Decay factor: 0.99 for management purposes and 1 for regulatory purposes (or equal
weightingofthehistoricalscenariosofreference)
 Non-linearity of pay-outs: managed through an assessment of the portfolio in full
evaluation
TheriskfactorsconsideredbytheVaRmodelforregulatorypurposesare:
 shareprices;
 volatilityofshareprices;
 interestrates;
 volatilityofinterestrates;
 exchangerates;
 volatilityofexchangerates.
Formanagementpurposes,theinternalmodelalsoestimatesthespecificriskfactor.
The regulations provide for a prudential requirement additional to the VaR, calculated using
market inputs related to periods of financial stress ( "Stressed VaR”). The scope of application
ofthestressedVaRincludesalltheriskfactorsintheVaRmodelforregulatoryuse.
All positions in the Banca Akros and Banco BPM Trading Book are subjected to measurement
of market risk. The Trading Book is identified as all positions present in the portfolios to which
was assigned the attribute of portfolio containing transactions for trading purposes. This
attribute is assigned when a new portfolio is entered into the Front Office applications by the
applicant operator. To this end, there is a specific process rule “Process of opening new
position keeping portfolios” which defines the players involved and the activities that each of
them must perform for the portfolio to be entered. At the same time, this process guarantees a
precisedistinctionbetweentheTradingBookportfoliosandthoseoftheBankingBook.
In order to estimate the capital requirement using the internal model, the capital requirement
isthereforecalculatedusingthefollowingformula:

The multiplication factors established for both Banco BPM and Banca Akros are 4.4 for the VaR
andtheStressedVaR.
Market risk stress test
Stress Tests are tests carried out on a portfolio to identify the scenarios, i.e. the changes in a
seriesofriskfactors,theoccurrenceofwhichwouldincurasignificantloss.
These tests allow identification of the risk factors that contribute more than others to this
negative result and consequently allow implementation of loss-limiting strategies when these
scenariosoccur.
Stress testing is mandatory for the purposes of validating Internal Models for quantifying
minimum capital requirements for the market risk, as it provides banks with indication of the
level of capital required to deal with any loss arising from long-lasting deterioration of the
economic-financialconditions.
Itisalsoasupportingtoolforotherriskmanagementandmeasurementtechniques,inthatit:
 providesaprospectiveviewofrisksandtheireconomicimpact;
 exceeds the limits arising from risk management models based on historical data (HVaR
withreadingofthelast250observations);
 integratesmanagerialreportingandpublicdisclosure;
 providesinputdataforcapitalandliquidityplanningprocesses;
 providesindicationofabank’slevelofrisktolerance;
 guarantees development of risk mitigation and recovery plans in certain stress
situations.
For the Banco BPM Group, stress tests are carried out regularly for the entire trading book. In
order to establish the value of the book in stress scenarios, the full revaluation approach has
beenchosentoensurethatallirregularitiesinpay-offsofinstrumentsarefullynoted.
Two types of scenario are applied: historical scenarios (in which the changes in each risk
parameter are consistent with the worst historical observations) and hypothetical scenarios in
whichthechangesintheriskparametersaredefinedthroughexpertvaluation.
In order to represent the overall risk associated with a trading book, the link between the
market risk and the liquidity risk—specifically in terms of market liquidity risk, that is, the risk
which, due to a sudden shortage in market liquidity, a bank is unable to close some positions
promptly (at a price approaching the theoretical price)—is of particular importance. The time
required to allow timely closing of the risk positions of a trading book is considered to be 10
business days. This horizon is consistent with supervisory recommendations, traders´ opinions
andhistoricalquantitativedata.
Hence, in Stress Test evaluation, when possible scenarios are identified based on 10- day time
ranges or, for data concerning daily oscillations in parameters, the VaR data is re-
parameterisedona10-daytimehorizon.
Backtesting
The most important aspect of back testing is the comparison between the values of expected
losses(VaR)andtheportfolio’sactualortheoreticallosses.
Once these two comparable figures have been obtained, it is possible to statistically analyse
the frequency of exceptions, i.e. of those cases in which the VaR measure estimated by the
modelproveslessseriousthantheactuallossrecorded.
The prudential supervisory regulations establish that the change in value of the book (or
individual position) must be as significant as possible for comparison with the VaR (not only is a
direct comparison between the VaR calculated on a portfolio and its Profit and Loss result of
littlerealvalue,butitmayalsoleadtoincorrectconclusions).
The best measure is the actual net change, that is, the measure obtained by excluding
commissionsandthecontributionforaccruedinterestfromtheoperatingresults.
The back tests are also conducted on the basis of the hypothetical change in the portfolio,
obtained by revaluing the quantities present in the portfolio on day t-1 with the day t (test
date)prices.
Each day, the VaR result is compared with the P&L result, both Actual and Theoretical, as
described above, and a report is provided on how the ratio between the two measures has
evolvedonahistoricalbasis,thatis,overthelast250observations.
The Group chose to carry out back testing not only on the banks’ entire portfolio, but also to
compareatportfoliosub-aggregateslevel,theP&LbacktestingresultandtheVaRresult.
This decision was dictated by the intention to check and monitor the performance and
reliability of the VaR model results on various levels of the company´s organisational structure,
wheretheresultislessinfluencedbytheeffectsofnetting.
The decision is also consistent, in management terms, with the attribution of VaR limits on
variouslevels.
From an operational point of view, this decision means that it is possible to check the extent to
which the model in use is valid for the various portfolios, highlighting those areas in which
modelling of the changes in P&L on the basis of historical simulation is more efficient and
whereitisless.
Furthermore, if exceptions should arise, it is possible to precisely identify the individual
componentthatproducedtheeventandthereforetotakeappropriateaction.
Scope of authorisation to use the internal models approach issued by the Bank of
Italy
At present, the following risk profiles are included in the internal model: generic risk for debt
securities, equity securities and UCITS units; specific risk for equity instruments and UCITS units,
also prudentially calculating the exchange rate risk which is measured with internal models
andalsowiththestandardisedapproach(doublecounting).
At this stage of the validation process, the internal approach is also adopted for quantifying
theriskarisingfromchangeinthepriceofinstrumentswithirregularpay-off(optionsrisk).

Fair value policy
To ensure increasing clarity, transparency and comparability of data relating to the fair value
measurementoffinancialinstruments,forthebenefitnotonlyofshareholdersbutalsoofallthe
bank’s stakeholders, the Banco BPM Group has set in place internal rules and an internal
policy that provide transparent and comprehensive governance of the methodological
approach and operating model adopted by the Bank for the fair value measurement of
financial instruments, in compliance with regulations in force (accounting standards, financial
statementregulations).
The fair value policy is applied to all valuations made in the Annual Report (Balance Sheet,

Fairvaluemeasurementoffinancialinstrumentsmayoccur:
 through use of market prices or values that meet certain requirements ( ‘mark to
market’);
 through use of market prices or values of similar instruments or transactions that meet
certainrequirements(‘marktomatrix’);
 through use of measurement techniques and models based on market parameters (
‘mark to model’), whether entirely observable or in part deriving from hypotheses and
assumptions.
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument is a price listed on an active
market.
If the market is not active and the listed price does not provide a correct representation of the
instrument´sfairvalue,theBankdeterminesthefairvaluebyadoptingavaluationtechnique.
The valuation technique aims to establish the price at which the transaction would have
occurredatthevaluationdateinnormalbusinessconditions.
Valuationtechniquestakethefollowingintoconsideration:
 if available, the prices of recent transactions on similar instruments suitably corrected to
reflect changes in market conditions and technical differences between the instrument
to be valued and the instrument selected as similar ( ‘comparable approach’ or ‘mark
tomatrix’);
 valuation models commonly used by the financial community that have proven over
timetoproducereliableestimatesofpriceswithregardtocurrentmarketconditions.
With regard to the latter type (valuation models), the Bank makes maximum use of observable
market parameters reducing as far as possible the input from internal assumptions and/or
estimates.
In conducting its assessments with a pricing model, the Bank takes into account all the
relevant factors for the purpose of determining a price that may be considered representative
ofahypotheticalmarkettransaction.
The Bank also periodically conducts a calibration exercise on the valuation techniques to test,
on an ongoing basis, their validity with regard to actual market transactions or to any other
observablevaluethatisrepresentativeoffairvalue.
Fair value measurement also involves the application of valuation adjustments to take into
account the risk premiums considered by the operators when pricing the instruments. If not
explicitlyconsideredinthevaluationmodel,thevaluationadjustmentsinclude:
 model adjustments: to consider the weaknesses of the models highlighted during the
calibrationphases;
 liquidity adjustments: if the model estimates a mid-price, it must be adjusted to take the
bid/askspreadintoaccount;
 credit risk adjustments: if the model does not take the counterparty risk or own risk into
account,itmustbeadjustedaccordingly;
 other risk adjustments: if the model does not take a risk premium priced on the market
into account (for example, concerning the complexity of valuation or hedging of the
instrument),itmustbeappropriatelycorrected.
These corrections are permitted only to the extent to which they help to obtain a better
estimate. Accordingly, valuation adjustments are not adopted if they distance the valuation
fromthefairvalue,forexample,merelyforprudentialpurposes.
The Fair Value Policy consists of two main documents: a first document describing the
procedures and the source of valuation of the Securities and a second document that applies
toDerivatives.
The aim of the first document concerning Securities is to define and formalise the Bank´s
operatingchoicesforfairvaluemeasurementofnon-derivativefinancialinstruments.

Fair Value Policy - Compliance with regulations
Compliance with regulations of the Fair Value Policy—validated by the Validation function at
the time of application for the validation of the internal model for market risk—is constantly
guaranteed by organisational safeguards in place for its process of maintenance and
change. More specifically, proposals to change the technical annexes of this document are
submitted for the approval of the Parent Company Risk Committee on the proposal
of/following an investigation by the Risk Unit, which also considers aspects of prudence and
reliability(establishedbytheregulatorylegislation)oftheassessmentapproachesproposed.
Pricing models
OTC derivative instruments are managed on a specific position keeping application (namely
theRisqueapplicationofthecompanyMysis/Sophis)whichallowscalculationofthefairvalue,
managementofpositionsandrisk(calculationofriskGreeks,calculationofVaR,management
of cash flows, management and accounting profit and loss account) and preparation of all
inputtothesummarysystems(accounting,reportingandcreditlineused).
The fair value is calculated by associating each product with a pricing model which considers
the characteristics of the product and specifically the dynamics of the underlying market
variables. For particularly complex products or if the default valuation model of the Risque
system is considered insufficient or not appropriate, the pricing models may be integrated with
valuationmodelsdrawnupbytheFinancialEngineeringUnitofBancaAkros.
In both cases, the models are validated and regularly reviewed by the Market Risks Unit, which
is responsible for certifying the correctness of the pricing models for the positions managed
withintheRisquepositionkeepingsystem.
Validation of Models
The activity of validation arises from the need to use a new pricing model dictated by two
differenttypesofneeds:
 tomakeexistingproductpricingmodelsmoremarketcompliant;
 tomeasurenewpayoutsbyTraders.
Thisactivityconsistsofthefollowingpoints:
 theoreticalanalysisofthemodel
 deterministicpayouttesting
 payoutstresstesting
 parameterstresstesting
 repricing
 consistencyofGreeks
 comparativetestingwithcounterparties’prices
 drawingupProduct/ModelValidationreport.
If the outcome of all the tests is positive, the Validation report is submitted to the Product
InnovationCommittee.
Review of the Models
Models are reviewed in order to check that previously validated models still reflect the
changed market conditions and thereview is carried out by repeating the validation tests and

EU MR4 - Comparison of VaR estimates with gains/losses
The outcome of backtesting of the VaR estimates, that is, comparison of the expected loss
estimated ex-ante through VaR with the corresponding actual profit and loss figures regarding
performance of the regulatory trading book of Banco BPM, and of Banca Akros in the period
December2018-December2017.
The components that are not pertinent to the back test, such as commissions and intraday
activity,havenotbeenincludedinthedailyprofitandlossreadings.
In the period examined, the number of exceptions (higher losses than the VaR estimate) is
consistent with the level of confidence used (an estimate with 99% confidence level means
that an exception occurs in 1% of the residual cases: in 250 business days this result is therefore
expectedin2-3businessdays).

Equity exposures
Disclosures for positions in the banking book, not for trading
Exposures differentiated based on objectives pursued and accounting techniques
The classification policies adopted by the Banco BPM Group distinguish between equity
investmentsbasedonobjectivespursuedandthenatureoftheinvestee:
- Directequityinvestmentsin:
- banking,financial,insurancecompanies;
- instrumentandrealestatecompanies;
- othernon-financialbusinesses;
- Indirectequityinvestmentsthroughthirdparties.
Below are illustrated A) the objective for which equity instruments classified in the financial
statements under the items "Equity investments" and "Financial assets designated at fair value"
are held (the latter broken down between those through profit and loss and those through
other comprehensive income and B) a description of the relative classification, accounting
andmeasurementcriteria.
A) Objectives pursued for equity instruments not included in the trading book
The Business Model adopted by the Group, pursuant to the international accounting standard
IFRS9,callsforadistinctionbetween:
- “Hold to Collect” (HTC): referring to financial assets held with the objective of receiving
contractualcashflows,holdingthefinancialinstrumenttomaturity;
- “Hold to Collect & Sell” (HTC&S): referring to financial assets held with the objectives
both of receiving contractual cashflows over the course of the asset's life and receiving
profitsfromsellingthesame;
A1)Holdtocollect(HTC)
This item includes interests in companies subject to joint control and associates, held for
strategic or institutional purposes or instrumental to the Group’s core business and to the
developmentofcommercialactivityandfinancialinvestment.
Joint ventures are investees in which the sharing of control is contractually established with
other investors, that is when for financial, management and strategic decisions relative to the
company,unanimousconsentfromallthosesharingcontrolisrequired.
Associated companies are non-controlled companies over which significant influence is
exercised. It is presumed that the company exercises significant influence in all cases in which
it holds a 20% or higher portion of voting rights and, regardless of the stake held, when it has
the power to participate in management and financial decisions of the investees without,
however,havingcontrol.
A2)HoldtocollectandSell(HTCS)
This category includes financial assets not designated as loans, assets held for trading or assets
held to maturity. This category also includes shareholdings that are not held for trading and do
notqualifyasinvestmentsinsubsidiaries,associatesandentitiesunderjointcontrol.
In addition to directly investing in companies' share capital, the Banco BPM Group holds
investments in private equity funds and in similar investment vehicles (UCITS, SICAV, FIA or other
similar structures) with the objective of investing in equity or similar instruments, through
interposedentities.
These are investments in units of funds other than open harmonised ones (and hence mainly
closedfunds,forexampleprivateequity,privatedebtandventurecapitalfunds)heldwiththe
objective of indirectly participating in the equity of companies, with lasting investment
purposes,intendedtoachieveeconomicgainsoverthemedium/long-term.
In line with the guidelines regarding Business Models pursuant to international accounting
standard IFRS 9, these investments are classified, in the context of financial assets obligatorily
designated at fair value (banking book), which represents a residual category and consists of
financial instruments that do not meet the requirements in terms of business model or cashflow
characteristics for classification among assets designated at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive: these are units of UCITS for which the contractual terms do not
envisagesolelypaymentsofprincipalandinterest(thosewhichdonotpasstheSPPItest).
B) Accounting and measurement of equity instruments not included in the trading
book
The book value of equity instruments is determined at the time of acquisition and periodically
updated, in particular at the time of public disclosures in line with the international IAS/IFRS
accountingstandardsandinternalregulationsonthesubject.
Determininginitialbookvalue
Equity investments are recognised for accounting purposes at cost, including any goodwill
paid at the time of acquisition, which is therefore not subject to independent and separate
recognition.
Financial assets designated at fair value are recognised at fair value at initial recognition,
normallycorrespondingtothetransactionprice.
For instruments measured at fair value other than those through profit and loss, the initial value
is adjusted to take into account any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
the financial asset. For financial instruments designated at fair value through profit and loss,
transaction costs and proceeds are accounted for in the income statement when the asset is
initiallyrecognised.
For investments in equity funds, initial recognition occurs at the settlement date for the UCITS
units and they are recognised at fair value when initially recognised. This normally corresponds
to the fees paid, without considering transaction costs or proceeds directly attributable to the
financialinstrument,whicharerecognisedintheincomestatement.
Periodicalupdatingofbookvalue
For equity investments, estimation of the recoverable value (impairment test) is done only
when there is objective evidence of a decrease in value such as to compromise the
recoverabilityoftheinvestment.
The recoverable value is the greater between fair value, net of sales costs, and the value in
use. Value in use is determined by discounting future cashflows the equity investment may
generate,includingthevalueofthefinaldisposaloftheinvestment.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement when the book value, including goodwill, is
lower than the recoverable value. If the reasons for an impairment loss are no longer valid due
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, recoveries are recognised in the
incomestatement,totheextentoftheimpairmentpreviouslyrecognised.
After initial recognition, financial assets designated at fair value are subject to measurement,
basedontheaccountingcategoryinwhichthefinancialinstrumentisclassified:
 atfairvaluethroughothercomprehensiveincome;
 oratfairvaluethroughprofitandloss.
Assets classified as "financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss" are
measured at fair value and gains and losses consequent to this measurement are recognised
in the income statement (including those consequent to derecognition of the assets - e.g.
sales and reimbursements). There are no requirements regarding recognition of impairment,
given that any losses in value are already implicit in the fair value measurement of the
instrument.
Assets classified as "financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive
income"arealsosubjecttoremeasurementatfairvalue.
However, profits and losses, whether consequent to the fair value measurement or realised
due to derecognition of the financial asset, must be recognised in the statement of other
comprehensiveincomeandregisteredinaspecificshareholders'equityreserve.
The amounts recognised in equity reserves, including exchange effects, are never subject to
transfertotheincomestatement.
However, it is possible to transfer them to another equity reserve (e.g. profit reserve) upon
derecognition of the asset. The assets in question are not subject to impairment requirements
andhenceanywritedownsarerecognisedintheequityreserve.
Periodic estimation of the fair value of financial instruments is done on the basis of the
hierarchy of criteriaestablished in theIAS/IFRS standards, attributingthe highest priority tolisted
prices on active markets (level 1), and the lowest priority to the use of data not observable on
markets (level 3), as these are the result of estimates and assumptions on the part of the
evaluator. Below are the details of each level, on the basis of the source and quality of the
inputused:
 Level 1: input consists of listed prices (not adjusted) on active markets for identical
assets and liabilities. A market is considered active when the listed prices express
effective and regular market transactions and are readily and regularly available
through stock markets, brokers, mediators, companies in the sector, listing services or
authorisedentities;
 Level2:inputconsistsof:
- priceslistedonactivemarketsforsimilarassetsandliabilities;
- priceslistedonnon-activemarketsforidenticalorsimilarassetsandliabilities;
- parameters observable on the market or corroborated by market data (e.g. interest
rates, credit spreads, implicit volatility, exchange rates) and used in the
measurementtechnique;
 Level3:theinputusedisnotobservableonthemarket.
Intheabsenceofanactivemarket,unlistedequitysecuritiesareassessedbyreferringtodirect
transactions in the same security observed over an equal period of time with respect to the
assessment date, or by applying the market multiples method and, subordinately, using
financial,incomeandequityassessmentmethods.
For the purposes of fair value measurement of investments in investment funds, on the basis of
the fair value hierarchy defined in IFRS 13, these are classified as level 3 due to the absence of
pricesdirectlyobservableonmarketsdeemedactive.
Measurement of the investments in question, in line with that established in the Group's Fair
Value Policy (which includes the Mark to Model Policy, as it is different from open harmonised
ones), is done on the basis of the most recent available NAV made available by the fund
administrator or management company, adjusted if necessary to take into account events
not included in the measurement of the unit or to reflect a different value of the assets
underlyingthefundinquestion.

Operational risk
Approach used to calculate capital requirements
For the purposes of determining capital relative to operational risk, the Banco BPM Group has
beenauthorisedbytheECBtousethefollowingregulatoryapproaches:
a) advanced approach (AMA) for the former Banco Popolare segments already
validated for the use of these approaches (former Banco Popolare segments of the
Parent Company, Banca Aletti including the private segments transferred to Banca
AkrosandfromtheformerBPMSpA),SGSBPandBPPropertyManagement
b) standardised approach (TSA) for the former BPM segments already validated for the
use of these approaches (former Parent Company BPM Scarl and former BPM SpA
segments transferred to the new parent company, Banca Akros including the
CorporateandInvestmentBankingsegmentstransferredtoBancaAletti),ProFamily
c) basicindicatorapproach(BIA)fortheGroup’sotherminorcompanies
The AMA model has been developed in such a way as to use all four types of input envisaged
bysupervisoryregulations.
The previous losses recognised internally are gathered by means of a rigorous Loss Data
Collectionprocess.
ExternallossdataisprovidedbytheDIPOconsortium.
Scenario analyses are gathered during the Risk Self-Assessment (RSA) process, during which
various business experts are asked to give their opinions on the exposure of all company
processes to operational risk, also with a view to the future. Aspects of the operating context
and of the system of internal control are continually monitored in order to promptly recognise
changesintheinternalandexternalscenario.
Lastly, note that, from a prudential perspective, the Group does not use mechanisms to
reduce pillar I capital, as envisaged in the Regulations, in relation to risk outsourcing/transfer
mechanismssuchasforexampleinsurancecoversorothersimilartechniques.
The Group’s total Capital at Risk (CaR) is calculated by combining the measurement of risk
obtained from the model based on previous operating losses, both internal and external, with
thatobtainedonthebasisofthemodelthatusesevidencefromscenarioanalyses.
Both models adopt the modelling approach known as the Loss Distribution Approach, which is
based on modelling annual aggregated loss, defined as the sum of the loss amounts (severity)
associatedwitheachofthelosseventsthatoccurinoneyear(frequency).
The risk estimate is conducted by means of a Value at Risk measurement, with a confidence
interval of 99.9% and over a time horizon of one year on risk classes that demonstrate similar
operatinglosses.
The total capital requirement is obtained by aggregating the risk estimates measured for the
various classes of risk, taking into account any benefits of diversifying exposure to the different
types of operational risk, and envisages the deduction of the provisions transferred to the
incomestatement,totheextentoftheexpectedlosscalculatedbytheinternalmodel.
Under the Traditional Standardised Approach (TSA) capital requirements are calculated by
applying ratios differentiated by business line (which varies between 12% and 18%) to the
average of the relevant indicator defined by the CRR 2013/575 for the last three years, broken
downbybusinessline.
Under the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), capital requirements are calculated by applying an
alpha coefficient (15%) to the average of the relevant indicator defined by the CRR 2013/575
forthelastthreeyears.
The portion of regulatory capital requirements determined using the AMA approach
represents 52.2% (equal to around € 243.5 mln out of a total of around € 469.8 mln) of total
requirementsforoperationalrisk.
Below is a detailed analysis of the AMA, TSA and BIA capital requirement as at 31 December

Interest rate risk on positions in the banking book
Nature of the risk, underlying assumptions and frequency of measurement
Interest rate risk assumed by the Banco BPM Group in correlation with its banking book is
mainly associated with the core activity performed by the bank acting as an intermediary in
the process of transformation of maturities. In particular, the issue of fixed rate bonds, the
granting of fixed rate commercial loans and mortgages and funding from demand checking
accounts represent a fair value interest rate risk; floating rate financial assets and liabilities
representacashflowinterestraterisk.
The Group has identified its risk appetite and set up a system of prudential limits also for interest
rate risk on the banking book, specifically approved by the relevant corporate bodies, to
contain the impact of any sudden rise or drop in market interest rates or - for equity - market
volatility,ontheinterestmarginandonthevalueofequitywithinthedefinedlimits.
The Interest Rate Risks Function of the Parent Company Risk Models unit is in charge of
measuring and controlling this risk, also on behalf of the banks and of the main financial
subsidiaries.
The structure responsible for managing interest rate risk is the ALM of the Parent Company
Finance Department, which carries out this task also on behalf of the banks and financial
subsidiaries, and pursues the maximisation of the economic return from the bank’s commercial

In order to reduce exposure to interest rate risk generated by assets, the Group has also
implemented fair value hedging of portfolios of similar mortgages and of Core demand items
bymeansofswaps.
To assess interest rate risk on the banking book and subsequent equity absorption, a variance-
covariance VaR methodology is used by the Group, over a 12-month holding period, with a
confidencelevelof99.9%.
Theitemsinthe bankingbook, considered at consolidated level, aremapped toaseries ofrisk
factors represented by individual buckets of the forward interest rate structure for both the
Euro and foreign currencies. Based on the volatility matrix and correlation between the
individualbuckets,themaximumexpectedimpairmentinthebankingbookisestimated.
The banking book also includes on demand items and those valid until cancelled, which are
the subject of replicating portfolio statistical behavioural modelling (with mean life
parameters) through which they are financially represented as equivalent to two portfolios of
termdeposits,onefixedrateandtheotherfloatingrate.
More specifically, in order to represent the particular characteristics of the persistence over
time of the volumes and the partial or non-immediate reactivity of the interest rates of these
items when market conditions change, two sub-models have been developed: the first to
analyse volumes, which enables the stable component of the aggregate of the demand
items to be represented as a portfolio of amortising term items (the latter is also estimated by
the model), and the second to analyse the interest rates, which enables both the component
that reacts to changes in market parameters to be identified (usually Euribor rates) and the
adjustmenttoequilibriumtobemeasured(viscosityeffect).
An additional statistical behavioural model enables the risk of early termination of the portfolio
of mortgage loans (prepayment) to be taken into account, measured using a “survival
analysis” approach, on the basis of which, a prepayment probability is estimated for each
mortgage loan which, applied to the contractual amortisation profile, enables a behavioural
amortisation profile to be obtained, corrected to consider the probability of the mortgage
loanbeingterminated.
Moreover, for bonds issued by the Group on the institutional market containing early
redemption clauses (which can be exercised exclusively by the issuer), the financial maturity
used to estimate interest rate risk is defined by assuming that the clause is always exercised
(not,onthecontrary,assumingthattheloanwillberedeemedatitsnaturalmaturity).
Monitoring and control is performed on a monthly basis also verifying compliance with the
limitsforchangesininterestmarginorequity.
The interest rate risk of the banking book of the Group, monitored by means of the sensitivity
indicators,recordedthelevelsshowninthetablebelow.

The Group makes use of an Asset & Liability Management procedure (ALM) for monthly
measurementof“sensitivity”tochangesintheinterestratestructureontheexpectedfinancial
marginandontheeconomicvalueofcapitalrelatedtothebankingandtradingbooks.
With regard to the expected financial margin, the ALM system estimates its changes on a
twelve month horizon (yearly) on the assumption of deterministic shocks of the floating interest
rate curves in relation to their level (currently, in relation to the low level achieved by the
market rates over the short-term, +/- 40 basis points applied to all the interest rate curves as if it
wereasudden,singleandparallelchange).
Estimates are based - from a static analysis viewpoint - on the assumption therefore that the
capital structure remains unchanged in terms of aggregate assets and liabilities, as well as in
termsoffinancialcharacteristics(rates,spreads,duration).
With regard to the economic value of capital, the ALM system applies assumptions on interest
ratecurvechanges,butwitha+/-200b.p.shock,measuringthechangeincurrentvalueofall
transactionsandcomparingthesechangeswiththeeconomicvalueofcapital.
In the case of a market scenario characterised by persistent negative interest rates on short-
term maturities, a floor on the reduction of the interest rates envisaged by EBA Guidelines is
appliedtotheinterestratesensitivityanalyses.
As mentioned earlier, for management purposes, the assessment of capital adequacy also
includes an estimated VaR measurement, using a variance/covariance approach, a time
horizonof12monthsandaconfidencelevelof99.9%.
Liquidity - Liquidity Coverage ratio
The Banco BPM Group, as more extensively illustrated in the section on risk management
objectives and policies, monitors and assesses the adequacy of the exposure to liquidity and
funding risk from a current and future perspective, and under the assumption of stress
scenarios, using both regulatory metrics (Pillar I regulatory perspective) and internal metrics
(internal perspective) defined on the basis of the specific characteristics of the Banco BPM
Groupandcomplementarytoregulatorymetrics.
These internal metrics include, for example, the survival period, the structural gap ratios and
other ratios that seek to capture other aspects of liquidity risk such as for example the level of
concentrationoffunding.
The adequacy of the risk profile is assessed and monitored continuously with respect to the
liquidity risk appetite stated by the Group in the objectives and risk limits of the Risk Appetite
Framework.
In 2018, the liquidity profile of the Banco BPM Group was considered adequate both in the
short and long term, respecting the risk limits envisaged both internally and, where present, at
regulatorylevel(LCR,NSFR).
In particular, as regards the regulatory metrics LCR and NSFR, both ratios maintained levels
thatwerecomfortablyhigherthantheregulatoryminimums.
The Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) - seeks to promote the short-term resilience of the bank’s
liquidity risk profile, by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid reserves to cover cash
outflowsforonemonthintheeventofaseverestressscenario.
The ratio is monitored internally on a daily basis and is also reported on a monthly basis to the
SupervisoryAuthoritythoughsupervisoryreporting.
In accordance with the obligations to publish information on the LCR, in force from 31
December 2017, the following table shows the average value for the past 12 months of the
LCRratioandthemainaggregatesthatcompriseit.

The figures show how the average level of the LCR in 2018 was 143.7%, comfortably higher
than the regulatory minimum requirement, with an average level of high quality available
liquid assets of € 20.5 billion, 99% of which comprised by the most liquid type (Level 1) of assets
eligible for the numerator of the LCR according to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 of the
Commission dated 10 October 2014. More specifically, the rules for calculating the LCR
subdivide high quality liquid assets into three categories, considered within the regulations in
decreasing order of their liquidity: “level 1", "level 2A" and "level 2B". Increasing haircuts are
appliedtothesehaircuts,aswellaslimitsintermsofcomposition.
In addition to these high quality liquid assets (HQLA), the Group has addition free marketable
assets which at 31 December 2018 were estimated as equal to around €2.7 billion, after
applicationofhaircutstotakeliquidabilityintoaccount.
Net cash outflows are calculated by applying regulatory outflow and inflow factors to
demand assets and liabilities or those maturing within 30 days so as to serve as a standardised
stresstestinvolvingbothsystemandidiosyncraticelements.
Below are details on the average value of the aggregates underlying the determination of net

EU LIQ1 – Qualitative information
In the Banco BPM Group, as illustrated in the section on risk management objectives and
management policies, liquidity management is centralised in the Parent Company, which also
serves as the lender of last resort for its subsidiaries. To that end, specifically with reference to
the LCR, note that in the last quarter of 2018 the European Central Bank accepted the request
to obtain exoneration from individual compliance with the LCR at the level of the individual
legalentitiesandtherelativereportingrequirements.
The liquidity identification and risk measurement framework includes additional safeguards,
complementarytoregulatoryrequirements.Amongthesewenote:
- periodic monitoring aimed at verifying the significant of exposures in currencies other than
theeuro.At31December2018therewerenosignificantexposures8incurrenciesotherthan
theeuro;
- monthly monitoring of excessive concentration risk relative to founding sources. Specific risk
limits are placed on unsecured demand funding relative to individual funding providers, on
thetotalofthetoptencounterpartiesandthepositionontheshort-terminterbankmarket;
periodic stress tests on the infra-daily liquidity profile, short-term liquidity profile and
medium/long-term funding profile. In this area, stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses are
defined on the basis of the results of the internal process used to identify risk factors. Analysis
performs includes, for example, risks deriving from derivative transactions, from potential
collateral calls and from potential unexpected requirements deriving from the operations of
the group's customers. This analysis is done making use of historical evidence as well as models
developedinternallyandupdatedperiodically.

Encumbered assets
Main types of encumbered assets
Themaintypesofencumberedassetsare:
 residential mortgage and landed loans and commercial mortgage loans originated by
BancoBPM,usedascollateralintheGroup’sCBProgrammes;
 residential mortgage and landed loans originated by Banco BPM assigned as part of
“RMBS” and “SME” securitisation transactions and performing lease agreements
originated by the former Banca Italease S.p.A. (now Banco BPM) assigned as part of
securitisationtransactions;
 commercial and residential mortgage and unsecured loans used for Central Bank
refinancingoperations(ABACO);
 securities used for short-term borrowing transactions with the Cassa Compensazione e
Garanzia(CC&G-settlementandclearinghouse)andothermarketcounterparties.
The main types of encumbered assets are represented by loans and by debt securities
recognised in the Financial Statements. The debt securities, mainly Italian Government
securities are used as collateral to raise funds in the short term through repurchase
agreements. Instead, the loans are used as collateral or as the underlying assets of longer-
term financing arrangements such as, respectively, the issue of CB or securitisation
transactions. The remaining part of the encumbered loans is used as collateral for financial
operationsinplacewiththeCentralBank.
Unencumbered assets are mainly represented by loans and debt securities. Both types of
assetscanpotentiallybeusedascollateralinthemaintransactionslistedabove.
The use of collateral in financial transactions requires that the value of the encumbered loans
ishigherthantheamountofthefundsraised.
More specifically, under CB issue Programmes, it is envisaged that a portion of the additional
portfolio is maintained as collateral for the CB issued in order to guarantee a certain level of
over-collateralisation. The loans portfolio underlying the CB Programmes is weighted, in order
to take into account any write-down/revaluation of the asset securing the transferred
mortgage loans and the performance of those loans, also considering any cash reserves
present in the SPE and the loan reserves required by the rating agencies to hedge set off9,
commingling10 and negative carry risks. Comparing the value of the portfolio and of the
reserves with the amount of the CB, the Programme’s credit support is obtained, which
providesanindicationoftheeffectivelevelofover-collateralisation.
For securitisations, the rating agencies require a “credit enhancement” constituted by junior
securitiesandcashreservesagreeduponwhenthevarioustransactionsarestructured.

Financial Leverage
Definition and regulatory framework
Part Two, chapter 12, of Circular no. 285 of 17 December 2013 "Regulations for the supervision
of banks" requires Banks to calculate the leverage ratio as established in Part Seven of
Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013,
onprudentialrequirementsforcreditinstitutionsandinvestmentfirms.
Thisindicatormustbemeasuredandmonitoredovertimeinorderto:
 limit the accumulation of financial leverage and therefore attenuate the brusque
deleveragingprocessesthattookplaceduringthecrisis;
 limit possible measurement errors associated with the current system for calculating
weightedassets.
In fact, the definition of excessive financial leverage risk set forth in the aforementioned
Circular(derivedfromthedefinitionsofart.4(93)and4(94)oftheCRRRegulation)reads:
"this is the risk that a particularly high level of debt with respect to own funds could make
thebankvulnerable,requiringit totakecorrectivemeasuresinits businessplan,including
selling assets at a loss, which could require recognizing value adjustments on other assets
aswell."
The leverage ratio is calculated as the intermediary´s capital (numerator) divided by the
amountofthebank´soverallexposure(denominator),andisexpressedasapercentage.
Tier1Capital
Leverageratio =
Amountofoverallexposure
The Risk Unit is responsible for monitoring the actual leverage ratio compared to the proposed
minimum threshold of 3%. It should be noted in particular that this indicator is included among
the Strategic indicators in the Group’s Risk Appetite Framework; hence it is subject to a
continuous control and verification of compliance with the defined thresholds (Trigger,
Tolerance, Capacity, as well as the Target threshold, which corresponds to the level set in the
BusinessPlan).
The Group currently calculates the leverage ratio based on procedures set forth in Annex XI of
Execution Regulation (EU) 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 which, starting from the reporting date 30
September2016,implementsthefollowingregulatorychanges:
1) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/62 dated 10 October 2014, which amends Art.
429ofRegulation(EU)No575/2013.
2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/428 dated 23 March 2016, which amends
ImplementingRegulation(EU)No680/2014,updatingthetechnicalrulesregardingreportingof
theleverageratio.
Details of the individual elements included in the leverage ratio calculation at 31 December
2018 are provided below. The Leverage Ratio indicator was 4.57% in December 2018, with the
transitional definition of Tier 1 capital, or at 3.75% with fully-adopted definition of the said
capital.
For completeness, note that these ratios were calculated on the basis of total exposures,
which had not yet benefited from the effects of the derisking and capital management
projects,whichwillbefullyappliedduringthefirsthalfof2019.
Vice versa, own funds are already weighed down by the correlated extraordinary cost
components,alreadyspentintheyearjustended.

Fourth quarter 2018 - Comment on the exposures considered in the leverage
calculation
At 31 December 2018, the Group's operations confirmed the minimal decrease in exposures
computed for the leverage ratio, compared to the situation presented at the end of the
previous year, showing a trend in line with the reduction of capital assets on the balance
sheet.
SFT contracts show exposures up by 8.4% (credit risk) and down by 1.4% (counterparty risk), the
latterespeciallyinfluencedbysecuritieslendingtransactions.
They mainly consist of contracts entered into with Qualified Central Counterparties and/or
leadingItalian/foreignbankingcounterparties.
Financial derivative contracts show exposures down by 37.9% for the replacement cost and
down14.7%forfutureloanexposure.
They mainly consist of contracts offset in the context of netting agreements, that is Interest
Rate Swaps entered into with Qualified Central Counterparties and/or leading Italian/foreign
bankingcounterparties.
At the end of the year there were no deductions for cash variation margins received in
relationtoderivativetransactions.
Deductions for receivables resulting from change margins in cash provided in transactions on
derivativesinsteadincreasedby201.7%,almostentirelyrepresentedbydailychangemargins.
Off-balance-sheet items with 20% FCC fell by 58.5% and are mainly represented by margins

Remuneration and incentive systems and practices
SECTION I
Banco BPM Banking Group staff remuneration policies - 2019 Policy
Policy 2019
1. Reference Legislative Framework
On 23rd October 2018 the Bank of Italy issued new provisions on remuneration policies and
practicesinBanksandbankinggroups(update25ofCircularno.285/2013,hereinafterBankof
Italy Supervisory Provisions), with the purpose of implementing the essential contents of the
"Guidelines on sound remuneration policies" in turn issued by the European Banking Authority
(EBA) in December 201511 pursuant to directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV)12 in consideration of the
evolutionofmarketpracticeandexperienceacquiredbysupervisoryauthoritiesinthisfield.
The 2019 Policy complies with the Regulatory Provisions of the Bank of Italy and transposes the
Delegated Regulation (EU) 604/2014 of 4th March 2014, published on 26th June 2014,
concerningtechnicalregulationstandardsfortheidentificationofidentifiedstaff.
2. Purpose of the 2019 Policy
Remuneration policies provide important managerial leverage, for the purposes of the correct
positioning ofmanagement and staff tothelimitationof risks taken by theintermediary and for
customers protection, in a spirit of correct conduct and management of conflicts of interest;
remuneration policies not set up with care can, in fact, exacerbate conflict of interest
between intermediary and customer, incenting employees to behave opportunistically, to the
investor’sdetriment.
In the interests of all stakeholders the 2019 Policy defines guidelines for Group Staff
remuneration and incentive systems, for the pursuit of long-term strategies, objectives and
results, in accordance with the general framework of governance and risk management
policies,levelsofliquidityandcapitalstrength,aswellastoattractandretainindividualswithin
the Group with professionalism and abilities suited for the Group’s needs, in the interests of
competitiveness and good governance, in the pursuit of fairness within the business and on
theexternallabourmarket.
Another purpose of the Group’s remuneration policies is to ensure suitable remuneration in
view of long-lasting performance. This enables staff enhancement, the recognition of
individual contributions in the achievement of results and discourages conduct detrimental to
fairness criteria in relationships with customers and compliance with regulations, which
generateexcessiveriskexposureorleadtoregulatorybreaches.

4.Identification of the Group’s identified staff
The process for the identification of identified staff is defined based on Regulatory Technical
Standards(RTS)issuedbytheEuropeanBankingAuthorityandprovidedfornDelegatedRegulation
(EU)no.604/2014(Regulation),whichcameintoforceon26thJune2014,aswellastheapplication
ofanadditionalcriteria,specificallyidentifiedforthepurposeofidentifyinganyfurtherpersonswho
assume relevant risks for the Group and who may not have been identified on the basis of other
criteria.TheParentcompanyHumanResourcesfunctioncoordinatesandformalisestheprocessfor
the identification of identified staff for the Group on an annual basis, justifying outcomes and
ensuring overall coherence, with the involvement of Parent company Organisation, Risks and
PlanningandControlfunctions.
The control process is implemented by Compliance and Audit functions, each within respective
scopeasdescribedinparagraph3.2hereabove.
Upon hearing the Remuneration Committee, the Parent Company Board of Directors approves the
identificationprocessaspartoftheyear'sremunerationpolicy.
The identification process is implemented within all Group companies and requires assessment on
an individual basis in the case of Italian Banks and at a Group level for all other subsidiary
companies. Said process is carried out by the Parent company in virtue of outsourcing contracts in
force, with the effective collaboration of the Group's banks. The key underlying principle of the
Regulation process consists of the evaluation of the relevance of each person in terms of
substantial risk-taking, on the basis of the individual position (for qualitative criteria, by way of
example, but not limited to such, responsibility, hierarchical levels, levels of resolution are assessed)
orremuneration(quantitativecriteria).
The interpretation of qualitative criteria for the application of the identified staff identification
processintheGroup,hasdeterminedthefollowingpositions:
 membersoftheBoardofDirectorsoftheGroup'sItalianbanks;
 Parent Company Risk, Compliance and Audit function managers as well as those who report
directly to them (including managers of the Anti-laundering and Internal Validation
structures);
 those who report directly to Management Bodies of the Group's Italian Banks (excluding
managersofinstafffunctions),includingParentCompanyGeneralManagement;
 managers of relevant legal entity (namely those to whom at least 2% of Group regulatory
capital has been distributed), managers of relevant operative units (namely those to whom
atleast2%ofregulatorycapitalofrelevantrespectivelegalentitieshasbeendistributed)and
thosewhoreportdirectlytobothcategories(exceptformanagersofinstafffunctions);
 managers in the first line of management of functions including legal affairs, finances,
including taxation, budgeting and economic analysis, human resources, remuneration
policiesandinformationtechnologies,aswellasappointedexecutivespresentintheGroup;
 members with the right to vote (including on call members), as well as any participants with
therighttovote,ofParentCompanyManagementBoardsforAssetAllocation,Finance,New
products and markets, Risks and Crisis, and, for subsidiary Italian banks, committee members,
if present, with identical resolution-making functions as those of Parent Company
Committees;
 roles responsible for the submission of proposals or with the power to adopt, approve or veto
credit risk exposures amounting to at least 0.5% of class 1 primary capital (CET1) of the Group
or of single Italian banks, or the minimum threshold established by the Regulation, set at 5
million euro. Members of the Parent Company Executive Committee, members with the right
to vote (including on call ones) are also identified, as are any participants with the right to
vote, of the Parent Company Credit Committee and NPL Committee or of any Committees
establishedinsubsidiarycompanieswithequivalentprovision-makingfunctions;
 roles assigned with proxies which can determine market risk exposure pertaining to trading
portfolio amounting to at least 5% of Value at Risk (VaR) on a time to time basis, as provided
atasinglelegalentitylevel;
 managers of groups of persons whose total power is equivalent to or higher than levels
definedwithreferencetocreditormarketrisk.
For quantitative criteria application purposes, all subjects belonging to the 0.3% of staff (including
those with overall remuneration equal to or greater than 500,000 euro) who have been awarded
overall remuneration greater than the previous financial year and all subjects who during the
previous financial year received total remuneration equal to or greater than that of subjects
identified for such qualitative criteria ( as specified in the Regulation), whose professional activity
has a material impact on the risk profile of the legal entity at issue. With reference to persons
identified based on quantitative criteria alone, the Group does not apply the procedure for the
exclusion of identified staff as provided in Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions an (EU) Decision
2015/2218oftheEuropeanCentralBankdated20thNovember2015.
Despite the distinction between staff belonging and not belonging to the internal control functions
considered by the Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions, the identified staff detected on the basis of
theprocessimplementedareclassifiedas:
 top identified staff: the CEO, General Manager, Co-General Managers and Managers in the
first line of management of the Parent Company, the CEO, General Manager, Co-General
Manager and Deputy General Manager (where present) of Aletti & C. Banca d’Investimento
Mobiliare,BancaAkrosandProFamily.
Topidentifiedstaffincludes:
 senior identified staff: the CEO, General Manager, Co-General Managers, senior
operational and executive managers of the Parent Company and Managers in the first
line of management of the Parent Company not included amongst the internal control
functions reporting directly to the CEO or the CEO of Aletti & C. Banca d’Investimento
MobiliareandofBancaAkros;

Along-termincentivesystemiscurrentlybeingdevelopedforstaff,endinginDecember2022,upon
the conclusion of the new strategic plan. Said system, financed partly by the saving of resources
traditional allocated for other forms of variable remuneration and other forms of variable
remuneration, aims to give a tangible signal in the sense of the promotion of a company culture
oriented towards the alignment of staff interests with long term shareholder interests, with the
awarding of an incentive to each employee, upon expiry, of an incentive correlated to the
appreciation of Banco BPM shares during the plan, in the event the Group achieves positive
performance levels. Said system, which may include the use of leveraged financial instruments
underpinned by Banco BPM shares, will be consistent in any case with the reference framework for
determining risk appetite, with risk government and management policies and with the purpose of
pursuing healthy remuneration policies. At the end of the study currently under way, if the

Generally, unless stated otherwise in the individual’s work contract, the Group’s employees do not
receive remuneration for positions held in Corporate Bodies of subsidiary and/or investee
companies as designated by the Group. This remuneration is paid in full to the company to which
they belong by the company in which the job is carried out. For those who do not receive

5.3 Remuneration of external non-employed staff
The remuneration of external non-employed staff that the Group uses is regulated by the
respectivecontracts.
For non-employed staff that fall into the category of financial advisers authorised for door-to-door
sales and financial agents, the remuneration is comprised by a recurring component which may
include, depending on the case, commission from entry fees and/or management fees and/or
linked to the contribution of assured revenue and/or to units and/or to brokered volumes. A non-
recurring component of remuneration may also be envisaged, which acts as an incentive; within

The possible payment of non-recurring remuneration components is conditional to the conditions

addition to indicators of a quantitative nature, it is also correlated with qualitative indicators
expressed with criteria that can be quantitatively measured (by way of example, but not limited to
such, the risk involved in its different meanings, the compliance with the legislation and regulations,
customer protection and increase of loyalty, product quality, quality of the service provided,
containment of complaints and legal or reputational risks), in line with guidelines of the Group's
incentive system25. The Parent Company’s audit function must verify these criteria, pursuant to
specificationscontainedinitema)ofparagraph3.2above.
6. Characteristics of the remuneration and incentive system
The characteristics of the remuneration and incentive system for Group staff are illustrated in this
chapter, taking into consideration strict criteria in evaluating results achieved. In compliance with
legislation in force, the award of variable remuneration components takes account of profitability,
necessary levels of capital resources and liquidity (hereafter entry gates), and is determined by
performance indicators measured excluding risks (hereafter the financial and non-financial
adjustmentfactor),takingintoaccountthequalityofperformancecarriedout.
The Group’s Staff cannot use personal hedging strategies or insurances on remuneration to
undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements. To ensure
compliance with the aforementioned, within the scope of the remuneration policy control
process26 the Audit function carries out sample evaluations of internal custody and administration
accounts, at least of identified staff who are holders or co-holders; detected breaches are
identified as misconduct27. Based on Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions, by means of the process
activated by the Parent Company's Human Resources function, the bank requests identified staff

6.1 Relationship between variable and fixed components of remuneration
Fixed remuneration29 is understood as the collection of elements referred to in point 1) of
paragraph 5.2, as well as the recurring component of remuneration referred to in paragraph 5.3.
Variable remuneration is understood as the collection of elements referred to in point 2) of
paragraph 5.2, as well as the non-recurring component of remuneration referred to in paragraph
5.3.
Theupperlimitofthevariable/fixedcomponentratioofGroupStaffis:
 2:1 for specific figures deemed to be strategic and selected from top identified staff and
Finance, Corporate, Investment Banking and Private Banking staff, as resolved by the
OrdinaryShareholder'sMeetingheldon7thApril2018(seeinfra);
 1/3 for all staff belonging to internal control functions30, in compliance with Bank of Italy
SupervisoryProvisions;

30ThescopeofapplicationofsaidlimitwasadjustedbasedonBankofItalySupervisoryProvisions(seeDefinitions,internal
controlfunctions).
With reference to profiles required by legislation and Bylaws, the Ordinary Shareholder's
Meeting held on 7th April 2018 approved a raise in the upper limit for general criteria (1:1) of
up to 2:1 (as permitted by the Bank of Italy) for specific figures as listed in the previous
paragraph. The proposal submitted to said Shareholder's Meeting was grounded in the need
to use all management drivers to attract and maintain professional persons with skills suited to
company requirements, for enhanced competitiveness and good governance. To this effect
and also taking into account that major competitors of the Group had already approved a
ratio upper limit increase to 2:1 for variable to fixed remuneration, adjustment to market
practice enables the Group to bolster its remuneration driver on total compensation. Given
that conditions for increase remain unchanged, reference staff and the upper ratio limit
between variable and fixed component of remuneration as resolved by the Ordinary
Shareholder's Meeting held on 7th April 2018, in compliance with Bank of Italy Supervisory
Resolutions, it is not required that said topic is once more submitted to the Meeting for
resolution.
6.2 Determination of the bonus pool
The Group’s bonus pool 31 constitutes part of the consolidated staff costs, approved by the
ParentCompany’sBoardofDirectorsattheendoftheGroup’sbudgetingprocess.
The annual amount of the above-mentioned Group bonus pool, with regard to the cited
process, only in the event that the budget envisages a profit32 may not exceed the threshold
of 20% of the profit from current operating activities before tax (net of non-recurring items)33
consolidated under the financial year’s budget; it is fixed also taking into account the Group’s
capitalisationandliquidityobjectives.
6.3 Connection between bonus pool and results
The award of the bonus pool is subject to the full compliance with predefined entry gates, as
well as that indicated in paragraph 6.4 below and is implemented in accordance with the
guidanceissuedfromtimetotimebytheSupervisoryAuthority.
In accordance with the Risk Appetite Framework approved by the Parent Company’s Board
of Directors, the award of the incentive and corporate bonus is therefore subject, for both
identifiedstaffandotherstaff,toindicatorsandrelativevaluesforcomparison:
- consolidated capital adequacy indicator: Common Equity Tier1 (CET1) ratio “phased-

6.4 Adjustment factor for the bonus pool
Following verification of the condition provided in paragraph 6.3 above, but before potential
payment, the effective amount of the bonus pool available is determined based on profit
achieved (financial adjustment factor) as well as qualitative indicators of a non-financial nature
(non-financialadjustmentfactor).Inbothcases,conditionsareincludedandmonitored,inlinewith
theGroupRiskAppetiteFramework.
6.4.1 Financial adjustment factor
Specifically,foreconomicresourcesoftheincentivesystem,anadjustmentfactor,thesizeofwhich

The application of the financial factor to economic resources of the incentive system defined
in the budget for the year (without prejudice to the portion awarded to identified staff of
functions with control duties, therefore those for which the following does no apply, in order to
avoid the incentive from being linked to economic profit) may result in their reduction (up to
zero) or increase, in the latter case subject to approval by the Parent Company Board of
Directors,whichalsodeterminestheexactfigure,specifically:
 in the case of a result equal to or lower than the Risk Trigger threshold, economic
resourcesaresettozero;
 in the presence of a result higher than the Risk Trigger threshold but lower than the
midpoint between the Risk Trigger and Risk Appetite thresholds (hereafter midpoint),
the Parent Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to decide the potential
availability of economic resources up to a maximum of 50% of budget value; the
potentialpaymentswillnotbeabletorelatetoidentifiedstaff;
 in the case of a result at least equal to the midpoint but no higher than the Risk
Appetite threshold, the value of financial resources envisaged in the budget is
automatically reduced by applying the percentage given by the relationship between

 in the presence of a result higher than the Risk Appetite threshold, any increase of the
financial resources up to the expected cap of 110% of their value in the budget is
subject to a decision by the Parent Company’s Board of Directors, which also
determines the exact measurement in relation to and within the limit of the relationship
betweentheresultachievedandtheRiskAppetitethreshold.

In the event of a change in the financial resources of the incentive system following the
application of the financial adjustment factor, the same change is also applied to the relative
portions assigned to identified staff that do not belong to the functions with control tasks,
determined by the amount of potentially accruable incentives; the portion of the financial
resourcesoftheincentivesystemofidentifiedstaffbelongingtothefunctionswithcontroltasks
willremainunchangedinvirtueoftheeffectofthefinancialadjustmentfactor.
6.4.2 Non-financial adjustment factor
The financial resources of the incentive system are also subjected to the application of a non-
financial adjustment factor according to methods described here below; said figure is
calculated in relation to the values of the consolidated Reputational Risk and Anti Money
Laundering (AML) indicators at the end of year, in relation to the relative Alert limits defined in
thecontextoftheRiskAppetiteFrameworkforthatyear.
The Reputational Risk indicator represents the total economic capital against the reputational
risk estimated through an internal model. The state of the Group's reputation is monitored
through collection and analysis of indicators, both of a quantitative and qualitative nature,
thatmayinfluence, onthebasisoftheircharacteristics,theGroup’sreputationinregardtothe
main stakeholders (customers, shareholders, market counter parties, regulators, employees,
and the financial community) employing reporting and forecasting, and considering stress
conditions. The indicators selected are both internal, i.e. derived from company processes,
and external to the Group, i.e. derived from market data, and belong to the following risk
areas: market, litigation/sanctioning, IT services, corporate social responsibility, regulatory
affairs.
The AML indicator represents the ratio between the total number of customers at high risk
(maximum classification in the context of the internal Anti-recycling model for the
managementofmoney-launderingrisk)andthetotalnumberofcustomers.
Application of the non-financial factor may result in the contraction of economic resources of
the incentive system for all staff, including identified staff with control tasks; therefore it bears
on:
 the economic resources of identified staff which do not belong to functions withcontrol
tasks, determined following the application of the financial adjustment factor to total
potentiallyaccruableincentives;
 the economic resources of identified staff with control tasks, determined by total
accruableincentives;
 the economic resources of remaining staff, determined following the application of the
financialadjustmentfactor.
Morespecifically:
 in the case of a result equal to or greater40 than the Alert limit of both the Reputational
Risk and AML indicators, the value of the financial resources is automatically reduced

6.4.3 Equalisation mechanism
Ifthefinancialresourcesoftheincentivesystemfollowingapplicationofthefinancialandnon-
financial adjustment factors are insufficient to cover the total amount of bonuses calculated
on the basis of performance achieved, an equalisation mechanism will be applied. This
consists of the proportional reduction of individual incentives. With specific reference to
identified staff, said reduction will be applied using the same percentage as the individual
bonusesinrelationtocategory(whetherornotbelongingtothefunctionwithcontroltasks).
6.4.4 Limits to distributions - combined capital buffer requirement
According to the Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions41, in cases where the combined capital
buffer requirement42, no distribution is made in relation to Common Equity Tier 143 44 that may
result in lowering the same to a level for which that the same requirement is no longer
respected.
In case of non-compliance with the combined capital buffer requirement, the variable
components of remuneration may be awarded and/or paid within the limits and under the
conditionsindicatedinthesameBankofItalyProvisions.
In any event, all decisions regarding dividends and variable remuneration must take into
accounttherecommendationsmadebytheEuropeanCentralBank45.

6.5 Incentive System
The incentive system consists of entry gates as described in paragraph 6.3 here above, of
financial and non-financial adjustment factors as described in paragraph 6.4 here above and
of implementations and methods described here below, applied by means of the allocation
of objectives correlated to an annual assessment period. Said elements ensure connection
with risks, compatibility with levels of Group capital and liquidity, orientation towards the
achievementofresultsinthemedium-longtermandcompliancewithregulations.
In addition to the evaluation of achieved performance levels in terms of quantitative results,
the incentive system is also characterised by mechanisms oriented towards the control of
different forms of risks and staff achievement of conduct which complies with the reference
legislative and regulatory framework, time to time in force and issued with the purpose of
utmost customer satisfaction. Said purpose is pursued via joint action mainly of three different
elements:
 the use of parameters of a qualitative nature and which impact incentive
quantification and which are expressed with quantitatively measurable criteria used to
gauge customer satisfaction, operative excellence in the service provided,
compliance with regulations (by way of example, but not limited to the results of
customer satisfaction surveys, the number of complaints, adequateness of customer
assistance, compliance with legislation and regulations, assessment of performance
and/ormanagementqualities);
 withreferencetoriskcontainment,theallocation:
 for commercial networks, wherever applicable of the objective pertaining to the
controlofcreditriskprofiles;
 for identified staff, of risk based or risk adjusted KPI, in line with risks assumed by staff
with reference to responsibilities and activities pursued in respective organisation
unit, in the reference Risk Appetite Framework, with particular attention to operative
risk;
 provision of malus claw-back mechanisms46, which directly affect the incentive and
evensettingittozero,withthepurposeofdiscouragingmisconduct.
Such provisions, adopted and implemented right from the first year of the Group in business,
are for the promotion of a company culture oriented towards fairness in the pursuit of own
responsibilities and activities as well as simultaneous risk management, thus favouring a
context of lower potential impact on operative risks and conduct. They establish focus on
operative excellence and on the service provided, indispensable for satisfying increasingly
demandingcustomerexpectations,incompliancewithlegislationandregulations.
For risk takers identified on the basis of their responsibilities receiving incentives and for specific
staff of the sales network47 the MBO (Management by Objectives) method of appraisal is
adopted,whichenvisagestheassignment,whenstartingthesystem,ofobjectivestocompare
with results achieved at the end of the year; in the remaining cases, the system is based on
managerialappraisaloftheheadofthedepartmenttowhichtheybelong.
46Seeparagraph6.7.
47ThelistofpeopletoreceiveMBOisnotexhaustive.
The MBO considers a contained number of indicators, in order to focus on the Bank's priority
objectives and to which a percentage weight is attributed to the total and a results curve on
levels of achievement (minimum, target and maximum); the result obtained by each KPI
determines a weighted score to be achieved, on a knowledge curve varying between a
minimum and maximum; the amount of weighted scores obtained corresponds to the
performance achieved which, only if it is at least equal to fixed minimum score, allows for
quantification of the incentive amount; this amount in any case cannot be above a fixed
upperlimit.
For recipients of MBO, the value of the incentive is calculated, in consideration of the financial
resources, with reference to the level of the position, the proximity of the function concerned
to the company’s business operations and the individual’s total remuneration with reference
to benchmarks. A percentage will be associated with every cluster, which will increase as the
combination of the position and proximity to the company’s business operations increases; this
percentage, applied to the reference market gross annual remuneration (GAR) for the
position/office, will determine the maximum amount within which the potentially accruable
incentivecanbedefined,consideringalsotheindividual’stotalremuneration.
6.5.1 Incentive system for the Parent Company’s Chief Executive Officer
Objectives defined for the Chief Executive Officer for 2019 regard profitability, liquidity, capital
requirements, value generated by the business for shareholders and qualitative aspects
regarding management activities, with particular reference to operative risk. Said objectives
also present a combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria, in the form of absolute
criteria, namely those which refer to Group profit, and relative criteria, which enable
comparison with similar bodies, as suggested by the EBA in its "Orientation regarding healthy
remuneration policies"48. Risk based indicators account for 40% of total MBO, indicators
expressed in relative criteria account for 45%. Achievement levels required for profitability and
liquidity are respectively correlated with budget value and thresholds established in the Risk
Appetite Framework approved by the Parent company Board of Directors for the year. The
amount of the incentive associated with 2019 objectives for the Chief Executive Officer can
amounttoamaximumof100%ofhisgrossannualremuneration(GAR).
As regards the awarding conditions for the variable remuneration, the same provisions, with
reference to this chapter 6, for the identified staff not belonging to the internal control
functionsareapplicable.

The incentive determined on the basis of performance achieved will not apply in cases of
termination of employment (unless with prior consent from the Parent Company, for specific
provisions contained in individual or collective contracts, in corporate agreements, that is, for
a unilateral corporate initiative, with a case-by-case evaluation necessary according to the
timewhentheterminationtookplace).
6.6.2 Payment of incentive of identified staff
The incentive of risk takers50 identified in the year is divided into an up-front portion and
deferredportions.
The up-front portion, to be awarded within the month of July of the year after accrual,
irrespectiveofthebeneficiary,isasfollows:
- 60%ofawardedincentive,iflowerthan430,000euro;
- 40%ofawardedincentive,ifequaltoorgreaterthan430,000euro.
For the Group, the value 430,000 euro is a particularly high variable remuneration level,

- three annual portions of equal amount, deferred over the three years after the year in which
the up-front portion is vested and to be awarded within the month of July each year,
consisting of 50% Banco BPM ordinary shares for identified staff not belonging to
aforementionedcategories.
There is a retention period (selling restriction) on the shares vested of one year both for the up-
front shares and for deferred shares; for the latter, the retention period starts from the moment
in which the deferred remuneration is vested. The vesting of the share portions takes place at
the same time as the respective cash portions, while actual transfer of ownership takes place
attheendoftheretentionperiod.
The shares, either as up-front or deferred portions, will be subject to taxation at the end of the
retention period, taking into account the so-called normal value, corresponding to the
arithmetic mean of official prices revealed thirty calendar days before the date on which the
portionswillbemadeavailablethroughtransferintothebeneficiary’sportfolio.
Any rights and/or dividends are only vested at the end of the retention period, that is with
reference to the period following the transfer to the recipient’s securities portfolio. In the case
of extraordinary capital operations which provide for the exercising of an option right, the
Board of Directors of the Parent Company may assess the resulting adjustments to any share

Both up-front and deferred portions are subject to malus and claw-back provisions, according
to that stated in paragraph 6.7 below, and do not correspond to cases of termination of
contract or employment (apart from, prior to following agreement from the Parent Company
for specific provisions contained in individual or collective contracts, in corporate agreements,
that is by a unilateral corporate action, without however the necessary case by case
evaluation,accordingtothetimethattheterminationtakesplace).
In accordance with the national bank procedures and with respect to the spirit of the current
provisions, in cases where the awarded incentive is lower than or equal to the materiality
threshold of 50,000 euro and, at the same time, lower than or equal to a third of the individual
gross annual remuneration (GAR), this would be paid in cash and on a one-time basis. This
provision does not apply to top identified staff (including senior identified staff), and those
whose52 variable to fixed remuneration ratio53 exceeds 100%, to whom the regulation is always
fullyappliedintermsofdefermentandallocationofshares.
6.7. Malus and claw-back provisions
Payments of variable remuneration components are subject to the ex post correction system
(so-calledmalus)describedbelow:
1. the vesting of each deferred portion of the incentive is subject to total compliance with
the consolidated entry gates and the relative threshold comparison values provided by
the incentive system of the year preceding the year of the share’s vesting, in
consideration of the Staff category belonging to the same year; this ex post correction
system is, therefore, a provision that operates in the deferral period, before the effective
vestingofdeferredincentiveportions.
The provision described in this point is applied to deferred incentive portions relating to
the former Banco Popolare and Bipiemme banking groups, accrued in 2014, 2015 and
2016;
2. with reference to identified staff and all other staff, in the event of ascertained
misconduct during the year, the Parent Company Board of Directors, for persons
directly appointed by it, or the Chief Executive Officer of the Parent Company
(ortheirproxy)forremainingpersons, assessesthemeasureoftheprovisionto be
adopted (which can act in reduction or zeroing) with reference to the incentive
and company bonus for the year, deferred portions of incentives for previous

Misconductisdefinedasfollows:
 provision of suspension from office and from payment of remuneration starting from
one day. Determines exclusion of cited percentages of variable remuneration
components;
 conduct which does not comply with legal, regulatory or by-law provisions or with
codes of ethics or conduct applicable to the bank, leading to a significant loss for
thecompanyortheGrouporforcustomers;
 breaches54 of the requirements stated pursuant to article 26 or, when the entity is an

54Forexampleincasesofbreachesofprofessionalism,integrityandindependencerequirements.
 violation of the obligation not to use personal hedging strategies or insurances on
remuneration to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in the
remunerationarrangements;
 fraudulent or grossly negligent conduct causing damage to a company or the
Group.
In the event of misconduct as described in point 2 here above, the Parent Company Board of
Directors, for persons directly appointed by it, or the Chief Executive Officer of the Parent
Company (or their proxy), for remaining persons, also reserve the right to activate mechanisms
for the return of previously accrued amounts or portions thereof, of the company bonus and
retention bonus for the year (claw-back clause), from the moment of accrual up to and
includingthesuccessivefiveyears.
With reference to the Group’s Staff and prior to award, the Parent Company’s Human
Resources function, with the help of appropriate corporate functions, annually verifies the
potential existence of conditions apt for determining the non-granting or return of already
vested and/or paid amounts and evaluates cases to submit to the possible decision of the
Parent Company’s Board of Directors, for persons directly appointed by said Body, or to the
Chief Executive Officer of the Parent Company (or their proxy), in the case of remaining
persons.
The company has the right to pay amounts that are objects of reclaim with those potentially
due in any capacity to the entity concerned and in this case the payment will take place,
following a decision made by the Parent Company’s Board of Directors, for directly appointed
persons, or the Chief Executive Officer (or his proxy) for remaining persons, from the moment of
the company notifying the entity concerned of the compensatory power, notwithstanding
anyotheractionprovidedforbylawtobeappliedbythecompany.
6.8 Long-term incentive system (LTI)
In 2017, a long-term incentive system (LTI) was first implemented in the Group on a triennial
basis, and is still inplace, consistent with the targets ofthe 2016-2019 Strategic Plan. This choice
results from the wish to link part of high-level managers’ remuneration to the shareholders’
interestsofrequiringthecreationofvalueforthecompanyovertime.
In addition to the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Parent Company’s General
Management, the scope of recipients of the LTI system, evaluated and validated by the same
ChiefExecutiveOfficer,includesalimitednumberofmanagerialofficeschosenonthebasisof
thepositionand/ortheresponsibilityandimpactoftheactivityonbusiness.
The LTI system, prior to positive verification of conditions and targets stated in paragraph 6.8.1
below, provides for the award of an incentive (LTI incentive) that corresponds to ordinary
sharesofBancoBPM(“performanceshare”).
6.8.1 Connection between LTI incentive and results
TheawardoftheLTIincentiveiscarriedoutinaccordancewiththeguidelinesissuedfromtime
to time by the Supervisory Authority and is subject to full compliance with predefined entry

EuropeanBankattheendofthe2018SupervisoryReviewandEvaluationProcess(SREP);
- consolidated liquidity adequacy indicator: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), having
reached at least the minimum level required for 2019 indicated by the Central European
Bankattheendofthe2018SupervisoryReviewandEvaluationProcess(SREP);
- consolidated profitability indicator: Profit from current operating activities before tax (net

Notwithstanding the positive verification of the entry gates, the size of the LTI incentive is
determined, onthebasis ofaperformance matrix, onthevalueoftheprofitabilityrisk-adjusted
indicator Return on Risk Adjusted Capital (RORAC) achieved on 31/12/2019, which will be
compared with the relevant Risk Target threshold (Strategic Plan 2019) provided in the RAF
approved by the Board of Directors in the meeting of 10 February 2017, and with the value
revealed in the three-year period of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR – source: Bloomberg)
financial market indicator, which measures the value created by a company for its own
shareholders, which will be compared in terms of relative positioning with respect to the peer
group made up of the eight most highly capitalised banks (Intesa San Paolo, Unicredit, UBI
Banca, Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna, Credito Emiliano, Banca Popolare di Sondrio,
Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Credito Valtellinese). If, over the course of the three-year period,
extraordinary operations should occur (not only of a corporate nature) to the banks
composing the peer group, or the data of one of these is not available at the end of the
Strategic Plan’s period, the Board of Directors will evaluate the adjustment of the performance
matrixinordertomakeitconsistentwiththenewsituation.
The combination of results achieved with regards to the above indicators determines the
effective number of shares to award to the beneficiaries of the LTI system and may also lead
toitsnullification;specifically:
- the entire number of shares will be awarded if the RORAC value achieved is at least
equal to the relative Risk Target threshold (2019 Industrial Plan) and simultaneously Banco
BPMachievesfirstorsecondplaceintheTSRindicator;
- the number of shares will be nullified if the RORAC value achieved is lower than 70% of
the relative Risk Target threshold (2019 Industrial Plan), namely if Banco BPM achieves
lowerthanfifthplaceintheTSRindicator(medianvalue);
- the number of shares will be reduced in other cases, applying the percentage stated for
therelativecombinationofRORACandTSRresults.
The following performance matrix outlines the ratios to apply based on the RORAC result

The LTI incentive, quantified on the basis of results achieved and performance matrices, will be
reduced by 33% for each year of the Strategic Plan’s duration, in the case of non-
achievement of the performance of the MBO scheme of the annual incentive system; the LTI
bonusmaythereforebereduceduntilitreacheszero.
During the Strategic Plan’s reference period, the Shareholders’ Ordinary Meeting will have the
authority, upon the Board of Directors’ proposal and following a favourable opinion from the
Remuneration Committee, to evaluate potential revisions of objectives to which to attach the
awardoftheincentive.
6.8.2 Payment of LTI incentive
The LTI incentive awarded in ordinary shares of Banco BPM is subdivided into an up-front
portion, equal to 40%, and three equal annual portions, as a whole equal to 60%, deferred in
thethree-yearperiodafterthevestingoftheup-frontportion.
There is a retention period (selling restriction) on the shares vested of two years for the up-front
shares and of one year for the deferred shares; for the latter, the retention period starts from
the moment in which the deferred remuneration is vested. The effective transfer of ownership
occursattheendoftheretentionperiod.
Shares, both up-front and deferred portions, are taxed at the end of the retention period,
taking into account the normal value, corresponding to the average price quoted in the thirty
days prior to the attribution date on which each portion shall be made available, by transfer
totherecipient’sportfolio.
With respect to the provisions of Art. 2357-ter of the Italian Civil Code, potential rights and/or
dividends will accrue exclusively with reference to the period following the transfer of the
recipient’s portfolio. In the case of extraordinary capital operations which provide for the
exercising of an option right, the Board of Directors of the Parent Company may assess the
resulting adjustments to any share portions that have vested but are not yet available to the
beneficiaries.

6.8.3 Malus and claw-back provisions
The incentive is subject to the same malus and claw-back provisions provided by the Group’s
remuneration policies in force from time to time for payment of incentives (annual incentive
system).
The LTI incentive shall not be paid in cases of termination of employment (unless, with prior
agreementbytheParentCompany,forspecificprovisionscontainedinindividualorcollective

prior to termination (assessment of the significance of such offences is carried out by the
Parent Company's Board of Directors in the case of directly appointed persons, or by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Parent Company for all remaining persons) precludes the payment of
any amounts for indemnity for early termination of employment. The Parent Company's Board

Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions also provide a predefined formula, contained in the bank's
remuneration policy and which defines the amount to be awarded for early termination of
employment, within the context of an agreement between the bank and employees, at any
stage of legal proceedings, for the resolution of a current or potential dispute. As provided for
by Bank of Italy Supervisory Provisions, if defined by means of the application of said formula,
the amount is not included in the calculation of the aforementioned upper limit of the
variable/fixedratio.
The formula adopted by Banco BPM with reference to identified staff requires the amount to

Irrespective of the method used to define the amount, payment thereof occurs according to

The Statutory Auditor, specifically appointed to this effect, attended Committee meetings,
without prejudice to the right of all members of the Statutory board of auditors to attend

1.2 Identification of the Group’s identified staff
The process for identifying identified staff was implemented via the combined application of
qualitative and quantitative criteria – the Regulatory Technical Standards – produced by the
European Bank Authority (RTS68), and also with the adoption of an internal criterion to identify
thetopidentifiedstaff69.
The Human Resources function of the Parent Company coordinated the activities, involving
theCompliance,Organisation,RisksandPlanningandControlfunctions,eachfortheirfieldsof
competence, of the Parent Company. The process, implemented at Group level, regarded all
Group companies, and envisaged an assessment carried at company level for the Italian
banks by the Parent Company (by virtue of existing outsourcing contracts) and took account
of the organisational positions, the hierarchical levels, the remuneration brackets and the
impactontherisksofallGroupstaff.

Specifically 153 persons were identified in the Parent Company, 29 in Banca Akros and

In relation to the individuals identified based solely on quantitative criteria, the Parent
Company did not adopt the exclusion procedure, as defined in Decision (EU) 2015/2218 of the
EuropeanCentralBankdated20November2015.
For newly identified persons, the Parent Company Human Resources function also (a) sent an
individual letter in which it informed each person that he/she had been identified as identified
staff, (b) requested a statement of commitment, in compliance with the applicable legislation
and the policies of the Banco BPM Group regarding remuneration and incentives, not to
adopt strategies of personal hedging or insurance on remuneration or on any other aspect
that may alter or invalidate the risk-alignment effects of remuneration mechanisms and (c) for
employees, it send a specific notification regarding the fact that the matter of remuneration is
subject to specific Regulatory and Supervisory provisions, as well as to company Policies, in
force from time to time, and to the legislative provisions that regulate the system; the latter
notification represented (where necessary and as far as necessary) an adjustment of the
individual employment contracts to bring them in line with the afore-mentioned legislation, as
any departures or individual agreements that are considered non-compliant are to be
consideredasbeingreplacedbylaw.
1.3 2018 Incentive System
In 2018, the incentive system in the Group was activated, in accordance with 2018 Policy
provisions and in consideration of the business and/or organisational characteristics of each
Groupcompany.
For identified staff identified on the basis of their responsibilities receiving bonuses and for
specific staff of the sales networks the MBO (Management by Objectives) method of appraisal
was adopted, which envisaged the assignment, when starting the system, of individual and/or
team objectives to compare with results achieved at the end of the year. In the remaining
cases, the method of assessing performance via Managerial Appraisal was adopted, which
entailed each manager informing his workers of the qualitative/quantitative objectives of the
department/officeandtheassessmentcriteriaofthesame.
Each MBO included both performance objectives (economic, project-related or efficiency)
and qualitative ones (customer satisfaction, the percentage of complaints, professional
and/or managerial quality appraisal, compliance with the rules and regulations on controls
andduediligence).
In addition, with regard to risk containment, the incentive system envisaged the assignment of
an objective regarding the control of credit risk profiles to the sales networks, and for identified
staff,theassignmentofrisk-basedorrisk-adjustedKPIs.
2. Information on remuneration
2.1 Remuneration paid to members of Corporate Bodies of the Parent Company

During the same session the Board of Directors also verified the maximum measure of
consolidated economic resources to be awarded to staff as part of the short term incentive
